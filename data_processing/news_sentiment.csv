The challenges Tesla owners are facing aren't specific to the carmaker. Other Tesla drivers report no issues   Christine Maslan, who lives in the village of La Grange, west of Chicago's Midway airport, tells NPR that she drove her family's Tesla for around 80-100 miles on one cold day this week.

I was scanning the Tesla Motors Club forum and the headline “Is my beloved 2018 LR Model 3 turning into a maintenance $$$$ nightmare?” grabbed my eye. The line graph and bar chart above show that  2018 Tesla Model 3s are a very small percentage of all the Model 3s sold to date  (around 8% of all Model 3 deliveries). )   On the other hand, Tesla is constantly changing things and improving models, whether they come with a big named refresh or not. So, that’s part of the challenge — one can’t know if common issues with a 2018 Tesla Model 3 will matter to a 2019 Model 3, or if common issues with a 2019 Tesla Model 3 will matter to a 2020 Model 3, and so on. Tesla mobile service took care of them all efficiently and I loved my model 3. Now that yours is fixed you should be good to go.” So, it seems that is an acute issue for early Tesla Model 3s and those of us who own newer Teslas shouldn’t fret. In the case of Tesla, independent research has indeed found reliability issues over the years, particularly with early model years of a new model.",neutral,0.994

I'd rent a Tesla from Hertz again, but I see why they're ditching so many of their electric vehicles. One of the men in front of me was asking the rep about his options — a  Tesla , a Volvo, a Chevy. When the worker went to the back to look for something, the man turned to someone nearby and explained he really  hated Elon Musk  and didn't want to rent a Tesla if he didn't have to. A conversation in the waiting room followed, with a spirited debate (well, as spirited as a bunch of polite Midwesterners get) about the pros and cons of Elon Musk and Tesla. I thought the employee might find it amusing after all the Tesla talk in the waiting room — but he wasn't fazed. Instead, the Hertz rep handed me the Tesla key card and sat back down at his desk.

Elon Musk  warned a slowdown in sales growth was coming when Tesla reported earnings on Wednesday. Or, as the EV maker tried to dress it up to investors, the company is now ""between two major growth waves."" Tesla had some pluses to report, churning out almost 500,000 vehicles in the September to December period. Tesla embarked on an aggressive price-cutting strategy in 2023 that reduced the prices of everything from the Model 3 to the popular  Model Y by more than 25%  to spur interest. Investors did not like what Tesla had to say, pushing its share price down more than 10% on Thursday, wiping more than $50 billion off its value. Tesla Model Y. SOPA Images/Getty Images                                       But against a backdrop of sharply higher inflation and interest rates, focus has been increasingly directed towards  a cheaper mass-market EV  from Tesla. The Warren Buffett-backed EV maker, which sells its vehicles in more than 60 countries and recently overtook Tesla on global EV sales, put an early focus on affordable models such as the $10,000 Seagull. WuYuan/Getty Images                                       Chinese automakers pose such a threat that they could ""pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,"" Musk claimed, ""if there are no trade barriers established."" Taken together, it explains why  Tesla  explicitly said sales growth would be ""notably lower"" this year – making it just the latest car maker to confront the wider slowdown in the developed world. Although a record 1.2 million EVs were sold in the US last year,  per data from industry research firm Kelley Blue Book , a slowdown beyond Tesla is very real. Growth is happening then, but at an increasingly slower pace in a phenomenon that's hitting pure-play EV companies like Tesla, as well as traditional automakers. Tesla does have some advantages in the slowdown. There are plenty of markets too that Tesla can target for rapid growth in the future, such as Japan. Part of the challenge, Musk said, lies in a ""lack of awareness"" about Tesla in a nation very well served by its own automakers, such as Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, and Nissan.",neutral,0.996

BYD has already emerged as one of Tesla’s biggest competitors worldwide, having  surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest seller of electric cars  in the fourth quarter of 2023. “I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world. “People are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla,” Musk said. But an affordable mass-market car, which Musk confirmed is under development, could help Tesla remain a dominant player in the EV segment. Tesla’s next-generation platform might help the company boost sales and improve its finances, as the company has cut production costs as much as possible for vehicles like the Model Y and Model 3, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said during the company’s earnings call. “While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.”   Tesla’s next-generation EV is expected to cost around $25,000 and will be built first at Tesla’s Giga Texas plant, with production starting sometime in 2025, Musk said. The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform.”   Tesla’s finances took a hit last year, as the automaker slashed prices to boost sales in an increasingly competitive EV market. On Wednesday, Tesla announced its Q4 earnings increased 3% year over year, rising from $24.3 billion in Q4 2022 to $25.2 billion in Q4 2023.

The world’s richest person, whose No 1 status is endangered by the  Delaware  ruling, held a poll on X asking whether Tesla should change the company’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to  Texas .” On Tuesday, a Delaware judge called a 2018 share-based package awarded to the  Tesla  chief executive “an unfathomable sum” that was unfair to shareholders, and struck down the arrangement. He moved Tesla’s corporate headquarters from Palo Alto in California to the Texas city of Austin in 2021 after criticising California’s regulations and taxes, and also clashing with health officials at the start of the Covid pandemic over reopening a factory in Fremont. It was not immediately clear whether the Tesla board supported Musk’s X declaration on Thursday. The Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick in  her ruling  on Tuesday, wrote that Musk, a 13% shareholder in Tesla, had “thick ties” with the directors negotiating his 2018 package and had “dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan”. after newsletter promotion “It won’t help that effort to have their very first customer be  Elon Musk  who expects them to kowtow to managers’ interests.

However, Tesla has  cut prices  as it faces increased competition, putting downward pressure on the company's revenue. Further, the company's vehicle delivery growth ""may be notably lower"" in 2024, Tesla said in the earnings release. ""Tesla is nothing more than a struggling car company,"" Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, told investors in a note Thursday reviewed by ABC News. For its part, Tesla said the slowdown owes to the company's focus on developing a ""next-generation vehicle"" that will arrive as soon as the second half of 2025. The conference call, Ives told ABC News in a statement, amounted to a ""trainwreck."" Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, June 16, 2023. ""But we remain firm on a long-term bull thesis around Tesla and the broader AI story set to take hold,"" he added. Tesla CEO Elon Musk drew attention last week when he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he's seeking greater voting control of the electric carmaker, threatening to otherwise pursue major projects such as artificial intelligence outside of the company. The Tesla board, Musk said, should grant him 25% voting control, an amount that would nearly double the vote share currently afforded to Musk through his stake in the company.

Tesla and Panasonic continued a long partnership despite the issues stemming from high demand in recent years. After developing the 4680 battery cell technology with Tesla, Panasonic decided to introduce an improved version of the 2170 battery cells for the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y in 2024 or 2025. The aim is to quadruple production capacity by 2030, benefiting Tesla, its main ally in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Resulting in an overall price drop for Tesla. Panasonic first started supplying Tesla with the 18650 type battery cells, later supplied 2170 type cells, and developed 4680 cells with Tesla. The evolution of the Tesla - Panasonic partnership was crucial for allowing Tesla  price cuts  and making Tesla the  top BEV seller  in the world. The history of the Tesla - Panasonic partnership    The ties between Tesla and Panasonic go deep. In 2009, only one year after Tesla released its first-ever car, the  Tesla Roadster , two companies signed the first initial supply agreement. One year later, the Japanese giant moved to tighten its ties and invested in $30 million worth of common stock Tesla. Under the agreement, Panasonic guaranteed the supply of enough battery cells to catch up with Tesla's rapid growth and make the pre-ordered  Model S  ready. Following the success of Model S, launched in 2012, Tesla and Panasonic expanded their partnership in October 2013 with Tesla to receive around 2 billion battery cells over the next four years. Tesla announced that the lithium-ion battery cells will be used in Model S and  Model X ; the latter was launched in 2015. The next big step came as the announcement of the Gigafactory Tesla, in which the EV maker signed an agreement with Panasonic in July 2014 to build the giant facility in Nevada together. To compare, we can look at the production capacity of leading countries in  2014 of Li-ion batteries :             Country   Capacity   Share in global output       Japan     2 GW/h   37%       South Korea   1.3 GW/h   24%       US   1 GW/h   19%       China   0.8 GW/h   15%             Under the agreement, Tesla prepared, provided, and managed the land, buildings, and utilities, while Panasonic manufactured and supplied cylindrical lithium-ion cells and invested in the equipment. In August 2018, Tesla said that the cell production capacity reached 20 GW/h, to reach maximum capacity by the end of the year. Despite total effort from both sides, the more substantial wave of demands pushed Tesla to search for alternatives in addition to the Panasonic partnership. First, rumours appeared in late 2018 that Tesla was talking with Chinese Lishen Battery, but Tesla denied signing an agreement. On the Tesla side, the EV giant acquired American start-up Maxwell Technologies in 2019 to apply their dry electrode technology to be used in 4680 battery cells. Nevertheless, Tesla never used the tech and sold Maxwell after integrating its ultracapacitor business into the company. Image: Tesla. 'The crack'   As almost inevitable in a happy story, the Tesla-Panasonic partnership had its cracks, becoming apparent in April 2011, following a Nikkei report suggesting that Panasonic was about to stop production in Gigafactory 1 due to lack of demand. Tesla shares began to fall while the information on online media indicated that Tesla already had enough battery capacity to produce over 500,000 Model 3's per year, as Panasonic announced reaching the initial maximum capacity of 35 GW/h per year in March 2019. Tesla CEO Elon Musk denied this on X (formerly Twitter), saying that Panasonic cell lines at Giga 1 are only around 24 GW/h capacity per year and limit the  Model 3  output. Tesla will need other partners and also won't invest in more capacity until Panasonic reaches maximum output (which eventually happened as the Japanese giant announced increasing capacity to 39 GW/h per year with an additional cell line in August 2020). Tesla received 4680 battery cell samples from Panasonic in 2020, and the latter unveiled its Tesla 4680 battery cell in 2021, with plans to pour $700 million into producing the new battery in Japan. Panasonic will continue improving the Tesla 4680 battery cell in 2024, while Tesla will have batteries in the Texas Gigafactory, which will be completed in 2022. Things now look relatively smooth for Tesla, as the EV maker announced the 20 millionth 4680 battery cell production in Giga, Texas, in October 2023.

Seeking to accelerate Tesla’s plans to open its new engineering headquarters, the City Council approved a deal with the car giant on Tuesday, Jan. With little discussion and no dissent, the council unanimously supported a public-private partnership under which the city and Tesla would split the $24 million cost of replacing two transformers and adding substation breakers, a power distribution center and two 12 kV feeders. Under the deal, Palo A lot would pay $12 million for this work as well as an additional $3 million to transfer feeder lines that do not serve Tesla to the new transformers, bringing the city’s total share to $15 million. Batchelor said that the Hanover Street transformers, which are located near Tesla’s new engineering headquarters at 1501 Page Mill Road, are nearing the end of their useful life. “We think this is going to be a really good partnership with Tesla, and we believe there’s no risk to the city by doing this,” Batchelor said. “If we were going to this on our own, we estimate we’d be spending somewhere around $18 to $20 million that the city would fund itself.” “By doing this, we’re saving about $5 million to $6 million in cost from this partnership.” Patrick Bean, Tesla’s director of charging and energy policies, called the deal a mutually beneficial way to increase the local grid capacity.” He said the company is planning to invest about $150 million in the new engineering headquarters, which formerly served as HP headquarters and which Tesla took over last year. As part of the deal, Tesla has already gone out to bid and selected a contractor to perform the work. “By taking up half the project cost as Tesla and 100% of cost to expedite, we ultimately think this is better for the community because we can bring it in at a lower cost than what would otherwise have occurred in the future. And we believe that availability of capacity will help drive further investment in Palo Alto just like what we as Tesla are doing.” The council voted 6-0, with Vicki Veenker recusing, to approve the deal (Veenker, an attorney, works with Stanford University on patent issues, and Stanford owns the land in Stanford Research Park that Tesla is leasing). Council member Greg Tanaka, who regularly votes against big-budget items, called the Tesla partnership “a pretty awesome deal for everyone involved.” “It seems like it’s something that we have to build, that we want to build, and we have someone who’s willing to pay for it, which is awesome,” Tanaka said.",positive,0.998

The move would tie the company's fate even more closely to its high-profile leader, ensuring Tesla will develop  AI  in-house at a time when the technology stands poised to shape the auto industry and a range of other sectors, proponents say. Critics, however, caution of a risky precedent if the company's board were to comply with the request, empowering Musk in any future dispute with shareholders little more than a year after he sold a large number of Tesla shares to help fund his acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk and AI is a key to the future of Tesla,"" Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, who is bullish on Tesla, said in a memo to investors on Tuesday. Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Tesla owner Philip Benassi drives his car in Jessheim, Norway, Jan. Petter Berntsen/AFP via Getty Images According to Ives, Musk currently owns roughly 13% of Tesla. Before selling shares in 2022 to fund the $44 billion acquisition of X, Musk owned about 22% of Tesla, Ives added. The possible development of AI outside of Tesla would deliver a significant blow to the company's prospects, Ives said, citing the critical role of the technology in projects like full self-driving capability. ""If Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own company separate from Tesla for his next generation AI projects this would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story,"" Ives added. Ultimately, the board and Musk could reach a compensation agreement in as few as three months that leaves both sides satisfied, Ives said, adding that the move would ensure some viewed by many as a tech visionary would lead ""the new era of AI technology coming to Tesla."" Gary Black, managing partner at the Future Fund, who is also bullish on Tesla, echoed the sentiment in a  post  on X. ""Still plenty of time for the [Tesla] Board and Elon to come up with a new comp plan that properly aligns incentives,"" Black said. Such a prospect is especially concerning at a time when Tesla has weathered multiple product recalls and declining profit margins, Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, told ABC News. Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, June 16, 2023. ""The prospects for Tesla are dismal,"" Johnson added, saying the demand from Musk offers him a pretext for departing the company. ""He sees the writing on the wall."" In December, Tesla agreed to r ecall  about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. ""Tesla has done a great job with self-driving but it's mostly a misnomer and cake dressing,"" Irwin said.",positive,0.997

Image provided.) Tesla  will open a regional distribution center in Fountain Inn in  Greenville County , S.C. The center is believed to mark Tesla’s first major investment in operations in South Carolina. The inaugural Tesla facility in the Palmetto State will be located in  Fox Hill Business Park  -- the Class A business and industrial park which came online in 2020 as the first major business park developed in Greenville County in well over a decade. The Tesla facility in Greenville County will mark the second such venture between Tesla and The Sudler Companies in 2023, the duo having announced a similar project near Tampa, Florida, in 2023. “Tesla’s commitment to Fox Hill Business Park in Greenville County is a testament to the continued strength of our company’s partnership with Tesla and to the indisputable drivers that make the park and the Upstate a force in the logistics world,” said Brian Sudler, principal with The Sudler Companies. Tesla’s work in Greenville County will focus strictly on distribution of vehicle parts regionally and won’t include manufacturing, officials said. Tesla will absorb all of Fox Hill’s Building 3, comprised of 251,100 square feet. Total investment and planned job additions by Tesla haven’t been made public. Late in 2023, Tesla posted a hiring notice for a training leader to support and train employees at the new facility in Greenville County. A company focused on accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to building a world powered by solar energy, running on batteries, and transported by electric vehicles that charge with clean energy. Tesla operates six vertically integrated factories across three continents and employs over 100,000 employees who design, build, sell and service Tesla products in-house. The Tesla announcement is the latest major announcement for Fox Hill, which also saw the recent addition of Sage Parts Plus, a global leader in replacement parts for aviation ground support equipment. “The addition of the Tesla brand to Greenville’s business ecosystem is another example of the important role that speculative development plays in today’s competitive environment, and exactly why Greenville County was so supportive of The Sudler Companies and Fox Hill Business Park,” said Kevin Landmesser, interim CEO of the  Greenville Area Development Corporation . “We are excited that Tesla has chosen to call Fountain Inn home for their first facility in South Carolina,” said City of Fountain Inn Mayor GP McLeer. McLeer added, ""We continue to be proud of our community's expanding role in the automotive industry and are excited to see Tesla begin operations.” Since its founding in mid-2001, the GADC team’s efforts have resulted in the announcement of more than 34,600 new jobs and more than $6.6 billion in capital investment in Greenville County.",neutral,0.995

Dojo, which was first announced at Tesla’s “AI Day” event in 2021, is a supercomputer meant to help advance the company’s still-unrealized goal of building a self-driving car. Tesla plans to use the supercomputer to process reams of video data that come off of its electric vehicles in order to train the AI that now powers its most advanced driver assistance software, which it calls Full Self-Driving Beta. Musk said  last year  that Tesla plans to spend “well over $1 billion” on Dojo. Bringing the Dojo project to Buffalo is the latest shift in Tesla’s priorities for the location, which has turned into  something of a boondoggle  for New York state. Once dubbed “Gigafactory 2,” Tesla took over the factory from SolarCity when it acquired the troubled solar panel company in 2016. Tesla promised to make Solar Roof tiles there, but struggled to produce the product at scale. Its partner, Panasonic, pulled out of the plant in 2020, and Tesla pivoted to employing people who  labeled training data  for its less-advanced Autopilot software. “Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year.",neutral,0.995

Tesla       Much of the success can be attributed to an extremely aggressive pricing strategy which saw Tesla slashing the cost of a Model Y by as much as $10,000 to undercut rivals. “The price cuts over the course of the year, combined with Tesla’s reputation as a reliable and competitive EV manufacturer, helped to fuel already high demand,” explained JATO Dynamics analyst, Felipe Munoz who crunched the numbers. “As a result, Tesla is front of mind for many consumers looking to purchase an EV.”   Tesla had to increase production at its plant in Berlin—which only makes the Model Y—to 375,000 units, while in Shanghai, China almost one million Model Ys and Model 3s were built. “Today the best-selling vehicle on the planet is an EV,” Tesla reported during its fourth-quarter earnings call.

Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) maker said growth would be ""notably lower"" than in 2023, when deliveries rose 38%. Tesla slashed prices repeatedly last year in a bid to keep demand up. In its quarterly update to investors, Tesla said it was not expecting another big wave of expansion until it launches a new model. Mr Musk's call for trade barriers in the increasingly competitive market came after  China's BYD overtook Tesla  as the world's top-selling electric carmaker in the last three months of 2023.

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas. The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. 17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained. He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. 17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive. 17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has",positive,0.998

He’s made it clear in the past that he would like to move Tesla there as well, Barzuza said. But because Tesla is a publicly traded company, Barzuza said, reincorporation in Nevada would still require shareholders’ approval and the court might not count Musk’s shares in that vote tally. In the Tesla compensation case, the court said Musk was a controlling shareholder, and in Delaware a conflicted controller transaction triggers the heightened scrutiny of the “entire fairness standard.” As part of that standard, a “majority of the minority” shareholders had to approve the compensation plan. “The standard also requires that independent directors conduct arms’ length negotiations with the controlling shareholder, and the court found that Tesla directors lacked independence, and ran a flawed process,” she said. “A move home to Texas would be an easier sell to shareholders than a move to Nevada, and is less likely to trigger an entire fairness review, given that Texas is not as protective to management and directors as Nevada is.” There is also another advantage Musk sees in Texas: Tesla employs more than 20,000 people at an Austin factory, roughly the same size workforce as that of the neighboring University of Texas. With some projecting that the company could soon hit the 60,000-employee mark, Tesla would become one of the largest employers in the state.

Musk’s Tesla enters the mainstream as it embraces Biden’s EV charger money - E&E News by POLITICO,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxObzVXUFlod3R2cENLLS1IUWEyTVA2ZjEtdjh0WWotbENwUzBhOE45cFZOU1VHUDFGV0ZUWFBYa2FiRXlNdVlESV9sckhwVkxkQ2lKWXoxcnVYa3NIdmUwMHVNR3g3bW40Y3doNkxWVnEtZ3RUQUxTWFBJNjFjcVYxNE1Fb3dBU0tHWVA5MEJTc3ZwLVdiYjdF?oc=5,"Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Elon Musk is a constant critic of President Joe Biden — but his car company is the biggest winner from Biden’s effort to expand the nation’s supply of electric vehicle chargers. Tesla is installing more charging plazas than any other company funded by Biden’s 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, according to an exclusive analysis of public records for POLITICO’s E&E News by the data consulting firm EVAdoption. Tesla has won almost 13 percent of all EV charging awards from the law, earning it a total of more than $17 million in infrastructure grants. This comes on the heels of other wins for Tesla, which makes more electric vehicles and operates more charging stations than anyone in the United States, and is  cementing its charging technology as the nation’s de facto standard . And it comes despite repeated friction between Musk and Biden: The Tesla CEO has mocked the president as  “a damp sock puppet in human form”  who  “is treating the American public like fools,”  while the  White House has condemned Musk  for actions such as  endorsing an antisemitic post  on his social media network X. The government funding will effectively embed Tesla’s distinctively shaped red-and-white chargers into the experience of not just Tesla drivers, but of all EV users on America’s highways. It is a win for Tesla, but also a form of capitulation: By agreeing to build federally funded stations, the iconoclastic company is also agreeing to play by the same rules as everyone else. Trump calls Biden’s EV push a ‘ridiculous crusade’   lead image   People who study federal electric vehicle policy say they see few downsides to having Tesla, with the country’s largest and most reliable network of charging stations, take a leading role in creating a government-supported network. “Tesla is a company full of very smart engineers and other professionals who have accelerated the transition to electric vehicles,” said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, an EV analysis shop based in Washington. “While their CEO gets disproportionate attention because of his antics, he does not define the company, and the company does not need his input to succeed.”   Meanwhile, Tesla’s nearly-13-percent share of the monetary awards appears far too low to raise antitrust concerns. It is within these pots of money that Tesla is winning the race. Tesla is taking a different tack than other firms seeking the federal infrastructure money. According to EVAdoption’s data, Tesla has won $17 million to build a total of 41 charging stations. At the same time, Tesla is putting fewer of its resources on the line in its efforts to win federal dollars. More than other firms, Tesla has refused to do so, meaning states have to pick up more of the tab. That is where Tesla’s stations will be built. Tesla scored federal dollars in Alaska, Colorado, Maine, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas and Tennessee, but none in Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Vermont or Utah, according to the EVAdoption data. Tesla, which has no public relations department, did not respond to a request for comment for this story. On an earnings call in 2021, he said the company’s goal “is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors.”   How Tesla chargers went mainstream   Tesla’s federal funding surge caps a rapid role reversal for the company in the young world of EV charging. A year ago, Tesla’s charging network stood entirely apart from competitors. Its Supercharger stations were an exclusive perk for Tesla drivers, and were for the most part incompatible with other makes of EVs. The Biden administration, too, kept its distance from Tesla, with the president and his surrogates  rarely mentioning the company  in his first two years in office — a slight related to contrasting views of labor unions. Biden is a famously pro-labor president, and Musk opposes efforts by labor unions to organize workers at Tesla factories. Then, last February, Tesla agreed to  open several thousand of its chargers to non-Tesla drivers  — a deal with the White House that opened the door to the company getting federal funds. That same month, Tesla opened its first station designed to charge a non-Tesla vehicle. In the spring came an even more significant development: Ford Motor said it  would build Tesla’s charging technology into its vehicles by 2025 . This month, one of the last holdouts, Stellantis, said it would also adopt the Tesla plug. Companies rushed to the Tesla standard because charging stations using the main competing standard, the Combined Charging System, or CCS, have  proven to be buggy . The widespread adoption of Tesla’s standards could have two material impacts for EV drivers: It would make it easier for drivers of future EVs from all brands to use Tesla’s existing Supercharger stations. And Tesla’s plug would start to appear everywhere. As automakers have adopted the Tesla standard, other, non-Tesla charging networks have followed suit. The industry shift toward Tesla technology left government agencies in a difficult position. It said a charging station using Tesla’s technology could get federal funds — as long as it also included a CCS plug. The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, a new agency stood up by the bipartisan infrastructure law,  applauded the technical adoption of Tesla’s standard , and FHWA started the process of  updating federal regulations  to include it. Tesla’s system goes by several names. The industry has adopted Tesla’s name for it: the North American Charging Standard. As the FHWA started embracing the Tesla system, the White House began delivering a similar message. At a briefing  in December, Heather Boushey, a member of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, said Tesla’s standard is “providing flexibility” for the federal program and “is rapidly increasing in popularity.”   Meanwhile, the White House has gone from ignoring Tesla entirely to occasionally mentioning it, though Biden continues to object to Musk’s animus toward labor unions. “Senior members of his team had a meeting with Elon Musk today to do just that.”   What Tesla loses   Even as it gets millions in federal EV-charging support, Tesla is giving something up.

This year’s ad, which aired regionally to select audiences in California, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Washington, D.C., cites the case of a 17-year-old North Carolina boy, who was  struck by a Tesla after exiting his school bus  last March. The Tesla driver had activated FSD, which is supposed to detect and avoid obstacles and other vehicles. Additionally, O’Dowd said tests show that a Tesla using FSD often failed to stop for and hit mannequins placed in the roadway to simulate the presence of children. O’Dowd claims he has developed the only unhackable software in the world, which earned him the Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award in June 2021, and said that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta mode is fundamentally flawed and unsafe. “You can see it on the [Tesla] display,” explained O’Dowd. He accused Tesla of being either incompetent or simply not caring. Senate seat to represent California on the sole platform of fighting Tesla FSD and Elon Musk, added that Dawn Project tests of similar technology in Ford and GM vehicles show they perform correctly. An email sent to Tesla seeking comment was not answered at this report. But Tesla sent O’Dowd a  cease-and-desist letter  last summer following another Dawn Project ad. Dinna Eskin, deputy general counsel for Tesla, argues that the Dawn Project manipulates the video and performed some of the tests that FSD is disengaged. O’Dowd published his own retort  online , and a spokesman for the Dawn Project said Tesla has not threatened any further legal action since then. Know-it-all notes in his own video-recorded tests that Tesla FSD will not function properly when the driver overrides the system with their foot on the accelerator. Behind-the-wheel footage he posted shows a Tesla slowing down for and going around actual people as well as cardboard cutouts representing children.

Tesla recalled over 2 million vehicles in the U.S. Then, on Monday,  Consumer Reports published an article  based on its own car safety experts’ findings that Tesla’s fix does not go far enough to fix the real problem. It reported that Tesla’s autopilot feature still does not have effective driver monitoring and does not allow for a seamless collaboration between lane-centering assistance and the driver’s own steering inputs. NHTSA told STN that it “generally does not comment on open investigations.”   But NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigations records show a  Preliminary Evaluation  of Tesla’s SAE Level 2 driving automation system opened in August 2021 after identifying 14 crashes of Tesla Model 3, Model S, Model X and Model Y electric cars into stationary emergency vehicles. “The investigation opening was motivated by an accumulation of crashes in which Tesla vehicles, operating with Autopilot engaged, struck stationary in-road or roadside first responder vehicles tending to pre-existing collision scenes,” NHTSA ODI investigators wrote in a June 2022 announcement that it was expanding its investigation. “Upon opening the investigation, NHTSA indicated that the [preliminary evaluation] would also evaluate additional similar circumstance crashes of Tesla vehicles operating with Autopilot engaged, as well as assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation.”   Regarding ongoing  NHTSA reviews of illegal school bus passing laws and technologies  to help mitigate violations, as required by the Investing in Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the agency said updates may be available “in a few months.”   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board in 2020 issued  nine recommendations  and reiterated several others following a fatal Tesla Model X crash two years earlier. Investigators determined system limitations of what it termed Tesla’s “Autopilot,” the driver’s overreliance on the system, and the driver’s distraction.",positive,0.997

The recently proposed  bill,  LB891 , is meant to fix a loophole in federal law that excludes Tesla and other direct sales businesses from being defined as manufacturers. However, the wording jeopardizes the future of a Lincoln Tesla shop. Bosn didn’t know that by defining Tesla as a manufacturer, her bill would also close a Tesla service center already operating in a “legal gray area,” according to the Lincoln Journal Star article. “And the redevelopment plan for the former Sears space wasn’t presented to the city’s Urban Design Committee until early January.”   The shop’s service manager told the Lincoln Journal Star that Tesla took possession of the building on Dec. Bosn’s bill is facing criticism from the Tesla business and Tesla owners, the article said. Tesla advocates told legislators in a Jan. 23 hearing that without the service center, Tesla owners would have to travel across the state for services such as warranty repairs, the article said. A more  recent article from the Lincoln Journal Star  states, “Stakeholders on all sides have since worked together to draft an amendment to the bill that would allow Tesla and other startup car makers to service the cars they sell directly to consumers, clearing up the legal gray area under which Tesla opened its Lincoln service center.”    The article does not detail what the amendment says. 16 Banking,… February 26, 2021 In ""Announcements"" A bill unanimously passed by the Oklahoma House Business and Commerce Committee would prohibit direct sales models, such as Tesla's, from operating in the state without having a direct shipper license.

Yet Tesla’s market cap is more than double that of Toyota. Tesla shares have soared since going public, while Toyota and other major auto manufacturers’ shares have meandered along. Since going public in 2010 at $1.59 (split adjusted), Tesla shares are up nearly 12,000%. The graph below, charting the two stocks since 2018, highlights Tesla’s outperformance versus Toyota and the extreme volatility of its returns. As shown in the second graph, 40-50+% drawdowns are not uncommon for Tesla. Tesla shares have outperformed Toyota’s and the market because of the significant growth of EVs, a robust outlook for EV market penetration, and forecasts that Tesla will maintain its lead role in manufacturing EVs. Tesla’s market cap relies on all three coming to fruition. Will EV competition from established and new auto manufacturers upend Tesla’s market share? Maybe most critical, could Toyota, not Tesla, be at the forefront of a significant technological advance for automobiles? With a price-to-earnings ratio of 9 for Toyota and 72 for Tesla, the answers to our questions have critical implications for shareholders of both stocks. Tesla Doesn’t Have a Monopoly Anymore   At one point, Tesla’s market cap was almost equal to that of the entire auto industry. Not only were Tesla investors projecting that Tesla would be the largest automaker, but also that some of their other ventures, like energy generation and robo-taxis would do fabulously well. Tesla no longer has a monopoly on EVs. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1. Bottom line: Tesla is losing its competitive advantage. This compares to the Tesla Model Y, which currently has a range of 542 km, and fast-charges in 27 minutes. Tesla does not believe in the viability of solid-state technology, and, as far as the market knows, it is not developing solid-state batteries. Tesla 4680 Battery Cells   Elon Musk is an innovator. Tesla is betting on 4680 batteries instead of solid-state. Fundamentals and Valuations   So, with an appreciation for the role of hybrids, EVs, and solid-state batteries, let’s compare Toyota to Tesla and better appreciate their comparative valuations and fundamentals. Valuations   Before looking at the valuation comparisons below, consider that Tesla is a high-growth company while Toyota is mature. Toyota is the world’s largest auto manufacturer, while Tesla is ranked 15 th . Given its smaller size, it is much easier for Tesla to gain global market share. Tesla trades at valuations 6-8 times that of Toyota, implying 6-8x excess growth for Tesla over the long run.",positive,0.997

The lawyers had earlier convinced the Delaware chancery court to  revoke Musk’s $56 billion  pay package from 2018, with the judge ruling that Tesla’s board of directors failed to prove it was fair to shareholders. On Friday, in a petition for fees and expense reimbursement filed to that court, the attorneys argued that the fee would be justified given how much value they delivered to Tesla shareholders. The lawyers represent former heavy metal drummer Richard Tornetta, who filed the suit on behalf of his fellow Tesla investors. The lawyers are asking for just over 11% of the Tesla shares that would have gone to Musk, or slightly more than 29.4 million shares. Tesla’s stock closed Friday at $202.64 per share, meaning the fee would be worth about $5.96 billion. Taking their pay in Tesla shares demonstrates they are prepared to “eat our cooking,” the lawyers wrote. They added: “This structure has the benefit of linking the award directly to the benefit created and avoids taking even one cent from the Tesla balance sheet to pay fees. It is also tax-deductible by Tesla.” The shares they’re asking for would be freely tradeable, they noted, while Musk’s stock options included a five-year holding period starting from when he exercised them. Representatives for Musk and Tesla also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. She said that the process leading to the package was “deeply flawed” in part because Musk drove the process for determining it, and it was agreed upon by Tesla board members “who were beholden to Musk.” Musk is  expected to appeal  the ruling. The CEO and centibillionaire has also said he will seek to  move Tesla’s site of incorporation to Texas .",neutral,0.996

I realize that this is meant to be a gardening column however for the last ten days my brain has been filled with Tesla minutiae rather than with garden details. As most people have heard, dealing with Tesla means dealing with the Tesla App. Tesla, unlike any other car company in the world, is allergic to human contact. This also involves buying a Tesla and trading one in – and in my case, this proved to be an unnerving process. In the middle of 2022, in the midst of the pandemic, I managed to buy a Tesla 3, waiting three months for it to materialize. Now, let me say this: I love driving an electric car, and I savored my Tesla, nicknamed “The Josy” after my first dog. Consequently, with the surging stock market, the strong economy, and the reduction in the price of Teslas, I determined that the solution to my problem was to purchase a Tesla Y, which is the height of a normal car. This time, I knew to head straight for the Tesla App. Already having an estimate from Carvana, I indicated to Tesla that I was open to a trade-in only to be ordered to take a myriad of photos of The Josy. With my photos in its clutches, the Tesla App robot replied that my photos were not of high enough definition, leaving me to throw up my hands in disgust – after all, I had the Carvana estimate in my pocket. I clicked on the “buy now” button – and Tesla gave me only three days to finalize the details before picking it up. Now understand that buying a Tesla outright does not involve the normal ways to purchase a car: credit cards and personal checks are strictly prohibited. I drove down to Tesla and threw myself at the mercy of a Tesla expeditor – remember, Tesla is allergic to car salesmen. I offered to write a personal check and wait until it had cleared, an action I thought was logical, only to be told that Tesla does not accept personal checks, even ones that have cleared. Then we talked about the problems with my photos, and Shon (the Tesla expeditor) generously offered to take the required photos herself and expedite the trade-in offer. Tesla would only give me a two-day extension if I wanted to buy the Y; I reminded her that I had to wait three months for the arrival of The Josy and the parking lot was now filled with a massive number of Teslas for sale, but here Tesla was obdurate, and I, a proud member of the Silent Generation, simply caved in. The trade-in offer appeared on my Tesla App later that day, one that I quickly accepted it as it was higher than the Carvana one, and Tesla then gave me the revised amount I now owed. The bank wired the money to Wells Fargo in San Francisco, and Shon, who had warned me that it could take up to three days to have it nestled into Tesla’s account, managed to speed up that process. The moral of this story if you are interested in buying a Tesla, is this: Be sure to ask for Shon, who is a real person.",neutral,0.996

Judge advances customers’ claims that Tesla reduced vehicle battery life on purpose - Courthouse News Service,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxOS3ZaY0F2anE0UzN5dTM0a0kzMEk3M2pxWGVxNU1BbkJqWmJ3Yl9aMkpPcDhDYVhRRTk3cmVqNjJMTGcxSENiMjhUM2x5QWstTkM4SzBDTXA4aGd2dmFiX1dMUGVKd21CN0pOdmtob3o2MTlaMHNNMUdBSFdXd3NwU2g0STV3US1KSnBCaXdLSExqVXZrcXRXN2JzRDFRT3pPSDhpb2Y2U0pEOU5ESVVWS1ByeGc?oc=5,"Wed, 21 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Judge advances customers’ claims that Tesla reduced vehicle battery life on purpose     Tesla owners can pursue their claims that the company deliberately reduced their electric vehicles' battery power, but the judge stopped short of issuing an injunction. (CN) — Tesla must face claims that it intentionally installed performance updates on many of its vehicles on the road, which intentionally damaged the batteries of vehicles in many states. District Judge Jon Tigar allowed some class claims to survive in the lawsuit filed by car owners who say the Elon Musk-cofounded company released software intended to reduce the battery life of Model S and X Tesla vehicles. The plaintiffs adequately pleaded that Tesla knowingly updated the vehicles’ transmissions with a series of software changes which immediately damaged many cars' batteries without the owners’ permission, Tigar said in  a 16-page order  Tuesday. However, the judge dismissed the plaintiffs' unfair competition claims, as well as a request to force Tesla to stop releasing performance updates while the litigation is underway. “Plaintiffs’ conclusory allegation of Tesla’s continuing practices in its plea for relief does not establish otherwise. The court understands that plaintiffs oppose Tesla’s conduct in pushing out updates that drain their batteries, and so want the court to order Tesla to stop. But regardless of how plaintiffs may feel about the conduct, the question is whether money damages would sufficiently compensate plaintiffs for their injuries.” Tigar said the plaintiffs did not show how Tesla plans to continue these practices in the future, nor whether the company bypassed security measures to ensure its updates were downloaded. “Plaintiffs’ allegations of misleading omissions do not establish, for example, that Tesla posed as a different entity or misdescribed the nature of the software updates to gain access to plaintiffs’ vehicle systems.” Tigar rejected most of Tesla’s attempt to toss the plaintiffs’ claims for common law trespass under the state laws of Florida, Virginia, Michigan, Washington and Arizona. The judge rejected Tesla’s contention that choice of law issues preclude the court from applying California trespass law to the plaintiffs who do not live in California. In its  motion to dismiss  filed July 27, 2023, Tesla argued that the plaintiffs did not cite facts to show how it circumvented any technical barriers to access the software on owners’ vehicles, nor any evidence of misrepresentation or fraud Tesla committed to make the software updates.",neutral,0.993

These other OEMs need help to meet their emissions standards, which has effectively become a very lucrative side business for  Tesla . Tesla generated a jaw-dropping $1.79 billion in regulatory credit revenue last year. That brought the cumulative total Tesla has raked in since 2009 to almost $9 billion. At the beginning, the electric automaker, founded 20 years ago, was to many investors and fans the answer to climate change, especially as Elon Musk showed the world that a zero-emissions vehicle could be both cool and profitable. At one point, he said helping to reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change is why Tesla “exists.”   For a decade, Tesla was de facto the only EV manufacturer. Selling regulatory credits is a tidy business for Tesla. Tesla bears little to no incremental cost earning the credits, so the sales are virtually pure profit to Tesla’s bottom line. Tesla has brought in more than $1.7 billion each of the last two years. It really frustrates the legacy automakers that Tesla got so much of an economic boost out of being the only purely electric car manufacturer out there. If these aggressive EV mandates hold for a number of the legacy automakers, Tesla’s regulatory credit business may still have a lot more room to run.",neutral,0.996

The referendum is not legally binding, but should “serve as an orientation” for local decision-makers and Tesla bosses who have lobbied hard for the “gigafactory”. Tesla has repeatedly pledged to keep water use to a minimum and to recycle its water rigorously. “Seemingly it has not been possible to convey to people that further important infrastructure projects, such as a new B-road or a railway station forecourt, [need the Tesla expansion]. Now the municipality has the considerable task of trying to find solutions to this.” Alexander Schirp, the managing director of the Berlin-Brandenburg business association (UVB), also expressed his disappointment, saying: “The Tesla investment is a lucky break for Grünheide and the whole of the state of Brandenburg. “We think that rather than the risks involved, it should be the chances this investment brings with it which should be the main focus, and that includes environmental concerns.” The gigafactory, the first Tesla operation of its kind in Europe, employs about 12,500 workers. In a statement after the announcement of the referendum result, Tesla described its expansion plans as “a big win for the community”, adding that it would “seek dialogue with all participants to decide on further steps”. Tesla added that the increase in warehouse capacity would help to increase the efficiency of delivering its cars. Last month, a strike by Tesla workers in  Sweden  over collective bargaining rights became the country’s longest-running stoppage in nearly 80 years. According to the  National Mediation Office , about a third of Tesla workers in the country have taken part in the strike since it began on 27 October, resulting in the loss of an estimated 1,936 days of Swedish labour. It has been  described as “insane” by Musk  and prompted Tesla to launch  legal action . In neighbouring Denmark, Norway and Finland, Tesla cars have been blocked at ports. On Wednesday, the Swedish trade union Seko also announced sympathy measures, saying it would stop maintenance, repairs and service of Tesla charging stations and block new connections, preparation and planning. By refusing to comply with the rules of the game here in Sweden, Tesla is trying to gain competitive advantages by giving the workers worse wages and conditions than they would have with a collective agreement. That is why we have chosen to issue another sympathy notice and increase the pressure on Tesla.”",neutral,0.995

This prediction proved true, as the Tesla Model 3, which is manufactured in China, topped the December best-sellers table with 4,790 deliveries. The German-built  Tesla Model Y  still performed well, with 4,618 deliveries enough for second, helping the US carmaker lock out the top two spots in the table again. Another Tesla title   The Tesla Model Y was crowned as the best-selling EV in France in 2023, with 37,127 registrations giving the crossover its first title. However, the China-made Tesla Model 3 will lose incentive access, and its deliveries are predicted to drop. Splitting the two Tesla offerings was the Dacia Spring, posting 29,761 registrations for its second runner-up spot in a row, and a city car category title. First foreign victory   Within the brand rankings, Tesla took a historical triumph in 2023, becoming the first foreign manufacturer to take the victory. Tesla took third (13.7%, up from 13.1%), in front of the VW Group in fourth (11.7%). The German manufacturer could take Tesla’s position in 2024, due to the predicted delivery drop of the Model 3.",neutral,0.993

The Highest-Mileage Tesla In The World In 2024 - Top Speed,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBQUldwd2FNNjlPLWZxellTOTBKOEJjbWI3dnFKLWh5OEZSclhYVTVOZVRuUWVoMFQyNWJFOWRDZ1JGU1NkQzgwbncxd29temZ5R2lnRUtzbUlDZlNybU1DTm5LT05TWkRPenc?oc=5,"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla has always been one of the better brands for electric mileage  and overall quality. Most drivers see their  Tesla s make it well beyond the 100,000-mile marker, although you'd be surprised how far these can truly travel. It all started with a man named Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg, who drove his Tesla Model S between multiple countries, near and far, eventually making it well beyond the MILLION-mile mark on his Tesla's odometer. This could be another type of story had the driver owned a hybrid or non-hybrid model, but thanks to the power and range of Model S, he saw the world through his Tesla without disturbing it. We'll dive into just how much this Tesla owner *actually* drove below, so stick with us! In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla and other authoritative sources, including the EPA and Watt Energy (YouTube). Related      	  						2024 Tesla Model S 			   The Model S has been around for a long time, but it is still one of the most competent EVs currently on sale. How One Tesla Model S Owner Made It 1,181,268 Miles                   When Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg purchased his Tesla Model S in 2014, he would never know what the next decade of electric driving would look like. Because of his Tesla Model S and its  high-performance specs , this owner was able to make it across the globe in style, as well as explore many roads less traveled. EV battery anxiety is always a thing  for Tesla owners, although Hornberg doesn't seem to mind the 265. This Record Is Thanks To A Model S P85        It's worth noting that Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg​​​​​ bought a Tesla Model S P85 back in 2014, pre-owned, and its  range falls at 265 miles  per full charge. With 88 MPGe in the city and 90 on the highway , this Tesla was known to be one of the more battery-efficient of the lineup. Many years and millions of miles later, this Tesla is still kicking and telling its tale. Tesla Model S P85 Specs                  Motor       Single electric motors           Horsepower       373-416 horses           Torque       325-443 pound-feet           Driveline       RWD           Battery       85 kWh lithium-ion           Range       265 miles           Used Price In 2024        $13,977 to $29,990 ( current market pricing )             (Table specs sourced from Tesla and Truecar)   It's also worth noting that the 2014 edition of Model S goes for a decent second-hand price, so you don't have to go with a new release to get many, many, many miles. Nearly 1.2 million miles later, the Tesla Model S is still finding new ways to stay busy. Now, you have Tesla's going 300+ miles with no issue at the standard level and close to 400 with long-range batteries. Related     The Tesla Model Y has encountered reliability concerns with recalls and complaints. Tesla uses high-quality, 85 kWh lithium-ion batteries  for this generation of S , and even to this day, drivers can't get enough of them. Related     Tesla is one of the largest EVmakers in the world, and here are all the costs you need to consider when you plug your Tesla in to charge. Hansjörg Owns Yet Another Tesla Model He Loves To Drive                                       Tesla         On top of the now iconic Model S Hansjörg owns, he also boasts a first-generation Roadster with around 456,700 miles on the clock. As of 2024, this remains the  Tesla with the most mileage  EVER, so that calls for some type of shout-out from Elon and the gang. Tesla Outperforms The Competition In Lifespan And Driving Quality        Even though Tesla has had its fair share of troubles and competition becoming steeper, that shouldn't discount what the brand has been able to accomplish in terms of  overall reliability and ingenuity for customers . At battery number four, we can only hope that Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg sees two million miles recorded in his favorite Tesla.",positive,0.998

But it's also possible that it was a fad that was at least partly manipulated by  Tesla  itself. "" Elon Musk  would've done this to put it in the hands of people who will be photographed driving it and obviously provide it a certain association,"" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a London consulting firm focused on the wealthy, told BI. ""It will be the biggest product launch of anything by far on Earth this year,"" he said last year, adding that he thinks it's  Tesla's ""best product."" But when the Cybertruck was  finally delivered  — the first batch of about a dozen, two years late — it left many  Tesla fans disappointed . Musk has said the carmaker aims to ramp up production to a level that Tesla will produce about  250,000 Cybertrucks per year by 2025. In this way, the Cybertruck is similar to other Tesla models which have started out as status symbols. It's no longer Hollywood A-listers like Morgan Freeman or Steven Spielberg pulling up to a red-carpet event in a Tesla, it's your  Uber driver  or next-door neighbor. ""If Tesla hits the goals Musk has set for the Cybertruck, it'll become just as commonplace."" Is Tesla behind the Cybertruck's sudden visibility? In short, it seems like even Tesla doesn't know the Cybertruck's target demographics, Moody said. Tesla only  began advertising  last year. The practice of bumping celebrities and the wealthy up on a waitlist or making them brand ambassadors is pretty typical, Moody said, adding that it isn't clear if Tesla is taking part in this type of marketing.",positive,0.998

The idea of using an M3P lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) battery surfaced again last year in the Chinese media, which claimed that Tesla plans to use the battery to boost the range in the Tesla Model 3 Project Highland edition. During 2022, there were reports that the new battery would be installed in the Tesla line-up in China, including the new  Model Y , but no announcement verifying these statements came last year. Most recent reports say that CATL and Tesla are still developing the M3P battery, and it is unclear when they will be used in Tesla cars in China. Still no M3P in the new Model 3   According to Teslarati, 'Project Highland' has been on Tesla's agenda since Q2 2022. In November of that year, Reuters revealed that Tesla was working on an upgrade to the Tesla Model 3, which would result in a different powertrain and exterior design. Reports on M3P indicate that the upgrade includes the battery, intended to increase the China-sold Tesla Model 3 capacity from 60 kW/h to 66 kW/h. The specs for the two models are:            2024 Tesla Model 3 Highland       Model   Rear-wheel drive   Long Range        Battery   57.5 kW/h  (271 hp)   75 kW/h (349 hp)       Range (EPA)*   437 km   576 km       Range (WLTP)**   513 km   629 km       Charging speed    Up to 282 km in 15 minutes   Up to 282 km in 15 minutes       Max power input   170 kW    250 kW       *U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  			**Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure             Tesla is building on the technical know-how   According to Bloomberg, the LFP chemistry-based battery plans will pick up speed as CATL plans to establish a small LFP battery cell facility in collaboration with Tesla in Nevada. The report does not provide insight into the partnership, but it says CATL engineers will only be involved in setting up the equipment, and Tesla will manage the factory and take care of all the costs. This is a critical move for Tesla. While the EV giant has reached mass production for its lithium-ion NCM (nickel-cobalt-manganese) battery with  Panasonic , the LFP chemistry is enabled for the first time in  North America  through the strategic partnership with CATL, boosting Tesla's technical know-how. The new facility is expected to produce LFP battery cells for Tesla Megapacks, the massive, stationary energy storage units. Political unease    It is not only Tesla that is keen on mastering LFP  battery technology . According to Reuters, in September 2023, the US House Committee on Ways and Means demanded information from CEO Elon Musk about whether Tesla has contracts with CATL or is considering having contracts. Still, the strong ties between Tesla and CATL and the role of the Chinese EV ecosystem in the  global supply chain  are also apparent. The main photo is courtesy of Tesla.",neutral,0.962
It's pretty clear: Elon Musk's play for OpenAI was a desperate bid to save Tesla - Business Insider,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOU2cyMlVMY0puVnZnTnBLLUpKa3RwTF9QZXhKMWcwSkV5YUV6SEw4V1RtdUV1bWdjaXRLNkVnUTBpV0lyNlVnQnd6YlNiVExyXzQybjk2N2ViVXNBZXdDTDhfcU5Ub3hlZHFNVkJBVFBTdm9IaS1tYVZjWGR5c1M4Qmh5Y3FYR1dRRXFJMzduTDUyQlZLc0U3c1NPcw?oc=5,"Sun, 10 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT","We know that  Elon Musk was very desperate  back in 2018. We know that  Tesla was near death  as it struggled to build the Model 3, the car that was supposed to be the company's saving grace. We did not know he'd suggested that OpenAI raise $1 billion, merge with Tesla, and name him CEO. And it's not hard to see how Musk's two desires — saving Tesla and wresting control of Open AI — are connected. The emails also indicate that by 2017, contrary to Musk's accounts, the Tesla CEO didn't have a problem with OpenAI becoming for-profit as long as he could take control of the company. In February 2018, Musk even suggested merging OpenAI with Tesla, saying that the automaker could be OpenAI's ""cash cow"" and that Tesla was ""the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google."" It was an extremely aggressive sell to Altman and Brockman — very "" come with me if you want to live "" vibes. But it was really Tesla that desperately needed a lifeline. 2018 was a very bad year for Tesla In February 2018, while Musk was shooting off merger missives to OpenAI, Tesla was in the thick of ""production hell"" on the Model 3,  bleeding money  and falling  behind schedule . The question was about how much money Tesla thought it was going to spend to get through the Model 3 launch — you know, business-critical, very-important-to-investors stuff. Related stories                                                Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know               Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know             That June, Tesla  laid off 9% of its staff . In August, Musk falsely claimed he had financing lined up to take Tesla private for $420 a share. Getting the Model 3 to Tesla's customers turned into a poorly planned, poorly executed logistical nightmare. Cars were so delayed that Tesla was spending a fortune on expedited shipping, and Musk was frantic to  lower costs . He asked Tesla employees from all parts of the company to  go personally deliver the cars to customers  on their  days off . Slowly, Tesla started to  make a little profit  — but not enough to make up for the year's losses, especially since it was deeply in debt. The company limped into 2019 with a  sinking stock price , a few executive departures, and an admission from Musk — on a closed call with select reporters — that Tesla would not be profitable in the first half of that year. That spring, Musk claimed that Tesla would have  1 million robotaxis  on the road in a year. Getting the Shanghai plant operational by the end of 2019 gave Tesla the opportunity to sell into China's booming electric-vehicle market and massively cut costs. Musk was willing to go to any length to save Tesla. In a December 2018 email, he implied to Altman and the other executives that without him and Tesla, their work would never come to fruition. Now he's suing OpenAI because, contrary to his saber-rattling, the company's explosion since the introduction of ChatGPT has it ascendant in the most exciting field in tech, while Tesla is yet again in a moment of weakness. Tesla's stock went on a glorious tear from 2019, after the Shanghai factory opening, through 2023. But over the past few months, Tesla has diverged from the rest of the group. Tesla is in a price war that has thinned margins, and sales are down. In a conference call in January after Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings — a miss — Musk didn't seem to have a plan for getting through this period. As much as Musk positioned himself as a white knight in 2018, Tesla was in dire straits. Musk was willing to go to any length to save Tesla. If Musk indeed believed OpenAI needed him or Tesla to succeed, he was as belligerent about it as he was wrong.",negative,0.996

Tesla reported 60,365 vehicle shipments from its Giga Shanghai factory in February, according to preliminary data from China’s PCA (Passenger Car Association) via Bloomberg. Tesla shares closed down 7.16%, its lowest close since Feb. Tesla's new Model 3 sedan displayed at the China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, China, Sept. In addition, Tesla uses earlier months in the quarter to fulfill shipments outside of China and generally ramps up shipments later in the quarter for China domestic sales. But Tesla’s lowest shipment total in over a year is a concern for the company, which sees China as a huge growth market. Even China’s BYD, which surpassed Tesla in overall EV sales in Q4 and generally dominates the Chinese EV market, saw its February sales tumble to 122,311 units from 193,655, a 37% drop. China now sells the most EVs in the world, but a recent  slowdown in demand for EVs  has led automakers there to engage in another price war earlier this year — and this includes Tesla. According to a report from Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner published on Monday, Tesla's latest incentives on the mainland include the “equivalent of ~$4.8K price cut to customers who purchase from existing inventories of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by the end of March.” Rosner said the new incentives include insurance discounts, discounts on paint changes, and preferential financing plans on the Model Y. The latest incentives come after Tesla  cut prices in January  for the Model 3 and Model Y by 5.9% and 2.8%, respectively. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price   •   USD               After hours: 7:59:59 PM EDT     The competition is fierce in China’s EV market, and Tesla having to cut prices and possibly reduce shipments is definitely a concern for investors.

Angela Chao, 50, CEO of a shipping company and sister of former transportation secretary Elaine Chao, died in her Tesla last month after her car went into a pond on a Central Texas ranch. To get into the Tesla, firefighters stood atop the submerged vehicle, according to the report, while trying to break inside the car through its windows. Sanjeev Mukerjee , professor of chemistry and chemical biology and affiliated faculty in the department of chemical engineering at Northeastern, says that battery compartments in electric vehicles such as Tesla are completely sealed and well protected. In the case of Tesla vehicles, they are equipped with a number of built-in sensors that can shut the battery off in case of a crash or rollover. “So there are safety guidelines built into Tesla at every point,” Mukerjee says.",neutral,0.996

The employee, who had been jointly employed by Tesla and two other firms between 2015 and 2016, alleged other employees  directed racist epithets toward him and other Black employees , demeaned him and drew racist caricatures located in various places within the Fremont, California, factory where he worked. A jury found that Tesla subjected the employee to a racially hostile work environment in 2021 and  awarded more than $130 million  in damages, which a federal judge  reduced to approximately $15 million  in 2022. District Court for the Northern District of California in 2018, described a work environment at Tesla’s Fremont, California, manufacturing facility as “straight from the Jim Crow era.” In a 2019 legal filing,  Tesla denied the employee’s allegations . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Tesla , alleging that it had tolerated racial harassment of Black workers at the Fremont facility and retaliated against workers who complained of harassment. California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing  filed similar claims  against the company in 2022 — also in reference to alleged discrimination at the Fremont plant — and went as far as to allege that Tesla maintained a “racially segregated” workplace. In 2022, Tesla published a statement in which it  called the DFEH suit “misguided”  and said it “strongly opposes all forms of discrimination and harassment and has a dedicated Employee Relations team that responds to and investigates all complaints.”",neutral,0.993

BMW X3M40i has clocked 34,000 miles (~ 55,000kms) in 3 years and Tesla Model 3 Performance is approaching 16,000 miles (~ 26,000kms) so that’s 80,000kms combined in 3 years with just me as the single driver (not counting the limited driving of my better half). Performance Tesla Model 3 Performance This is a drag strip king and will demolish everything that is stock that comes into its path- Be it a BMW M3/M4, Lamborghini or a Ferrari. The feeling of how this accelerates is very different from the Tesla. On the other hand, Tesla’s acceleration feel like you are sitting in an airplane and being propelled forward in complete silence which is quite eerie but, exhilarating at the same time. Winner Both have exhilarating acceleration but, giving it to Tesla Model 3 Performance purely for reasons of it being faster. Handling Tesla Model 3 Performance Firstly, it’s a compact sedan and secondly, it’s lighter than the BMW so it has 2 primary factors favoring it. In short, the Tesla Model 3 handles “almost” like a sports car. It’s a Compact SUV, It’s heavier than the Tesla. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance as it’s definitely a better handler than the BMW. Ride, Comfort & Braking Tesla Model 3 Performance Tesla has premium vegan seats (Optional) and they are big, soft, cushy and really comfortable. BMW X3 M40i Leather Seats are BMW M spec leather which means it’s harder on touch and feel and also feels premium than the Tesla seats. Overall seat construction is on the harder side & the bucket-styled seats somewhat snug into your thighs (Including the hard pull of seat belts when you start from a standstill) so, it’s not as comfortable as the Tesla. Ride is better than Tesla being on 19” wheels and now with Michelins, it just glides over patchy roads. I was never impressed with Tesla’s braking power. Even though my Tesla has all round discs, bigger pads, bigger calipers etc. It is a pleasure to use the BMW brakes compared to that on the Tesla. Safety Aids Tesla Model 3 Performance This car is loaded with safety aids. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance for the sheer long list of technology & safety aids. Technology Tesla Model 3 Performance Tesla is not a car but, a computer on wheels and is renowned in the industry for best all-round safety and technology features and has been rated as the “safest car” to drive in all important forums. But it’s still no match for the technology features of a Tesla. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance Space & Comfort Tesla Model 3 Performance This may come as a surprise but, many times family and friends who rode in the car have mentioned to me that there is more space in Tesla than the BMW. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance Build Quality Tesla Model 3 Performance Tesla had quality issues in the beginning but, they have improved a lot over the years. BMW X3 M40i BMW build quality is several notches above the Tesla inside and out. As soon as the lights turn green and I hear the chime, A simple dab to the accelerator on the Tesla, it just rockets forward and within a few seconds, I don’t see anybody in my RVM. Winner I would give this to BMW as it commands more respect than the Tesla on the road.",neutral,0.995

I looked at 2020 voting data and TSLA registrations in counties throughout the state of New York, and theorized as follows:   Watching  Musk’s ongoing antics , it has become very clear to me that his actions are not only destroying Twitter, but the collateral damage is taking Tesla down with it – a veritable twofer of ineptitude and rake-stepping. Consider who the typical Tesla buyer has been over the decade before he began to own the Libs: You would describe them as people who  do not  think global warming is a hoax; they are early adopters, willing to pay more for an EV versus an ICE car. As good as Tesla’s supercharging network is, it’s nowhere near the infrastructure buildout of gasoline vehicles, it can still be inconvenient on 300+ mile trips; although to be fair, ICE infrastructure has had a century head start.

This tale may sound familiar to first-time users of an electric vehicle (EV), be it a Tesla (ours was the standard model) or an  everyday battery-powered stallion . Meanwhile, standard acceleration for a Tesla 3—what I thought was ludicrous—is zero to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, aka fast enough to fling passengers against their seats and make anyone riding in the back feel like abandoning ship. In a Tesla, we could go 300 miles on a single charge . Without that, it could take 40–50 hours, or more, to get a full charge on 120 volts.) Kit the Robot Car had all the Tesla DCFC “Superchargers” programmed into its navigation, so it showed us the most strategic spot to “refuel”: New Paltz, 83 miles or an hour and a half away. As of today, the state of New York has 84  Tesla Superchargers , with more being added every year as the United States continues to invest in EV infrastructure. (California holds 25.5 percent; New York comes in second with 6.1 percent, followed by Florida, Texas, and Massachusetts.) In the past, Tesla Superchargers could only be used by Tesla drivers, a company-man mark of ego that was eliminated in late 2021, when Tesla opened its network of Superchargers to non-Tesla EVs. There are currently  Level 1 and Level 2 chargers across the USA , charging EVs in 4–10 hours (or days), as well as more DCFCs of the non-Tesla variety. Plans will likely be dashed when Tesla’s “red alert” comes on to recharge; the car  really  wants you to plug in around a quarter-battery.",neutral,0.991

While the specific recipients of these credits remain undisclosed, this revenue stream has been vital for Tesla’s financial success. Tesla’s Green Cash Flow: Profiting from Emissions Compliance     In its recent  first-quarter 2024 filings , the company reported a $442 million income from the sale of carbon credits (automotive regulatory credits). However, Tesla’s profits took a significant hit in the first quarter, falling 55% to $1.13 billion compared to a year ago. Despite reporting revenue of $21.3 billion in Q1 2024, representing a 9% drop from the previous year, Tesla’s earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations. Behind the dipping financial results, Tesla managed to generate more revenue from its regulatory credits. The  price for the carbon credit  remains discreet between Tesla and the buyers. Since the company started selling carbon credits to its peers, this revenue stream has become a billion-dollar bonanza for Tesla. Beyond Cars: Tesla’s Surge in Energy Storage Deployment   While automotive revenues experienced a decline, Tesla saw growth in other segments of its business, particularly in energy storage, which is becoming increasingly profitable for the company. As Megapack installations continue to increase and fleet expands, Tesla anticipates consistent profit growth in this segment. Energy Generation and Storage remains Tesla’s highest margin business. In addition, Tesla generated $2.28 billion in revenue from services, which includes income from its Supercharger network. This revenue stream is expected to grow further as more automakers, such as Ford, GM,  Rivian , and VW, adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard technology. Tesla’s Carbon Credit Surprises and Future Innovations   Despite previous expectations that  carbon credit income  would decline as competitors ramped up electric vehicle (EV) production, Tesla has been surprised by sustained revenue in this area. However, contrary to these predictions, Tesla’s earnings from regulatory carbon credits have not experienced a significant decline. Despite the profit dip, Tesla used its earnings report to highlight its future initiatives. Elon Musk underscored the company’s commitment to investing in the future, despite current challenges. Tesla aims to expedite the development of a new vehicle lineup, with production anticipated to begin in early 2025. Tesla’s Q1 results, though showing a decline in profits, sparked a surge in share prices, rising by as much as 12% following the announcement. Investors seemed more interested in Tesla’s forward-looking statements regarding future products, particularly introduction of cheaper vehicles by 2025. Musk emphasized during the earnings call that while some automakers are shifting towards plug-in hybrids, Tesla believes that battery  electric vehicles  will ultimately dominate the market.",neutral,0.996

As competitors roll out alternatives, Tesla faces a difficult path to regain its previous breakneck growth. “Tesla has been here before but this is a code red,” Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, a longtime Tesla bull, told ABC News. Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Last week, Tesla reported a significant decline in car sales over the first three months of 2024. Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, said consumer demand for the company’s cars has fallen sharply from the heights attained during the pandemic. At that time, a major shortage in the worldwide supply of auto parts ultimately benefited Tesla since the company streamlined production and outperformed hamstrung competitors, Johnson said. “Tesla had cars available when the auto industry writ large globally did not,” Johnson told ABC News. “Tesla has more capacity than there is demand for its cars,” Johnson added. “That’s the reason why it’s struggling.” Elon Musk hands over a Model Y car to a customer during the opening ceremony of the new Tesla Gigafactory for electric cars in Gruenheide, Germany, March 22, 2022. Patrick Pleul/Pool via Reuters, FILE Over the past year, Tesla has  discounted  some of its models in an effort to goose up demand. Analysts who spoke to ABC News said Tesla would need to release a newer, low-cost model as a means of attracting thrifty spenders. In December, Tesla  recalled  about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system. In response to a letter from members of Congress calling for an investigation of the self-driving system, Tesla senior director of public policy, Rohan Patel, said last March: ""Tesla's Autopilot and FSD Capability features enhance the ability of our cusotmes [sic] to drive safer than the average driver in the U.S."" The response was first reported by  Reuters . Looking ahead, analysts said Tesla retains a path to recovery but it remains unclear whether the firm can achieve it. “That will scare the bejesus out of Tesla bulls,” Johnson said. For Ives, the current crisis at Tesla marks an opportunity for the company to innovate and recapture its previous era of remarkable growth.",neutral,0.996

Tesla layoffs shake confidence in the EV-charging future - E&E News by POLITICO,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPYi1qZk5Nc0dEaHY1cWdoMXh0WC1nM2dRVXVkNmtLUVpBZThkNEpzM3p2YTZBQ1daSFN1Wk5yMTlyWEFVLUF0LThUeFZFLWZfczR1QkwtbjIyNHp4eTNrOHhkMHhGNW9NbmhDX3RBVUtkVVRacU9JQVJ5VnhfeDhXdy1VRXBWZFZtb0hoRTFRQW44VTQ?oc=5,"Wed, 01 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","For the last dozen years, as the prospects for America’s electric vehicles have veered between optimism and doom, industry insiders could always count on one rock-solid, reliable thing: Tesla’s charging network. In a single stroke, CEO Elon Musk called his company’s vaunted charging reliability into question when he laid off most or all of Tesla’s Supercharger team, the people who made Tesla the envy of the EV industry. “And leaves us on shaky ground.”   The abrupt decision left the ever-widening ecosystem of people who rely on Tesla — drivers, automakers, suppliers, electric utilities and policymakers — suddenly in the lurch, as emails to longtime Tesla contacts bounced and the most respected team in the industry all but ceased to exist. This targeted layoff is Musk’s latest response to a sharp downturn in Tesla’s prospects as its cars become less popular. “We need to be absolutely hardcore about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk said in an email to Tesla staff on Monday, reported first by  The Information . “What’s the plan, what’s the strategy, and at such a pivotal moment, why are they bailing on that entire team?” asked Jonathan Katz, an EV-charging executive who was part of Tesla’s charging unit for five years ending in 2020. Will Tesla drivers — and now other EV drivers — be able to continue to rely on the network that was one of the main perks about buying a Tesla? Will the automakers who bet their future EVs on Tesla’s charging stations and technology still have a reliable partner? Will Tesla be there to guide an industrywide transition to the technology that it invented? And will Tesla continue to participate in the federal build-out of charging stations — an effort that, until this week,  it was leading ? Musk on Tuesday addressed the uncertainty in a  post on X , the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and that Musk now owns, saying: “Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.”   The news, while startling, struck some as a canny move — perhaps one that reflects the maturing EV sector, where more players are coming onto the scene and can take over the charging tasks that Tesla has, until now, managed mostly by itself. However, some questioned how Tesla will carry out a slower expansion — or any operations at all — if the team behind it is no longer there. No one contacted for this story could name a single source in Tesla’s charging sector that still works there. One of those trying to reach Tesla’s team Tuesday was Andres Pinter, the co-CEO of Bullet EV Charging Solutions, a company that provides electricians and other workers to build charging stations. Tesla Supercharger stations account for a quarter of its work. The company’s chief operating officer, Mark Vogel, “was driving to a job in Dallas this morning when he received a call from our Tesla construction lead saying that his entire team was laid off,” Pinter wrote in a Tuesday email. “I have gotten email bounces from at least 20 Tesla contacts.”   “It’s unclear to me who, if anyone, is still at Tesla who has anything to do with charging,” he added in a phone interview. Tesla’s bedrock role   Tesla’s sudden reversal matters because of the constancy of its charging network. When Tesla founded the Supercharger network 12 years ago, it realized earlier than others that a widespread and reliable web of changing stations was key to ensuring drivers would make the jump to electric cars. The system grew out as a web of so-called Destination chargers — slow chargers located at overnight locations like hotels — and Superchargers, an exclusive perk meant for Tesla drivers to quickly fill batteries on the go. Tesla reported last week in a financial filing that it has built  more than 6,200 Supercharger plazas , far more than any other company. To carry out that feat, Tesla’s Supercharger team mastered a host of behind-the-scenes skills that it did better than anyone else: pinpointing the highway interchanges where a refill is most needed, coordinating with the electric utility to learn where the power supply was strongest and persuading restaurants and malls to trust Tesla’s promise that building rows of Superchargers in their parking lots would bring new foot traffic and customers. Any time a state legislature, agency or public utility commission considered a change in the rules to govern the new arena of EV charging — or offered money to build out a network — Tesla would usually submit comments. Tesla’s charging team worked hand in hand with the company’s public policy team, which has also been disbanded. Their drivers couldn’t use Tesla’s chargers, because they were meant only for Teslas. Last spring, it struck a deal with Tesla to use its 12,000 U.S. charging stations and committed to building Tesla’s charging technology called the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, into its future vehicles. By February, Tesla’s NACS had become the industry standard, with virtually every automaker planning to redesign their charging systems to meet Tesla’s specifications. Tesla’s charging prominence became such that it challenged the Biden administration’s plans and redefined federal policy. But when automakers piled into Tesla’s camp, the Biden administration was forced to scramble,  opening its rules to changes  so stations would qualify if they offered both systems. ‘A lot of questions’   With Tesla’s charging expertise now disbanded, the players who relied on it face uncertain circumstances. Tesla, already a winner of roughly 14 percent of these awards, is poised to pick up more in states that have announced tentative winners. But with Tesla removing itself from the market, “your decision is more complicated all the sudden,” said Loren McDonald, the founder of EVAdoption, an EV-charging data platform that tracks NEVI. With Tesla newly bereft of staff, she said, “What do you do?”   Even more consequential choices might face automakers, which are planning to install Tesla’s NACS technology in their cars starting next year. In theory, Tesla’s competitors can operate the new charging platform without Tesla’s help. But in practice, Tesla is —or was — the one with the most expertise, and without it, the new EV charging systems could be less reliable. “It leaves a lot of questions: Are these automakers still going to get the level of support they were promised?” asked Katz, the former Tesla charging employee. Automakers, for their part, said their plans to move to Tesla’s NACS are still underway. A spokesperson for Ford, Martin Günsberg, said, “plans for our customers do not change.” A spokesperson for General Motors, Darryll Harrison, echoed that sentiment and added, “we are continuing to monitor the situation.”   Whatever the consequences, the startling speed of the turnaround shows that EV charging — once the steadiest part of Tesla’s business — is now starting to look like another area subject to Musk’s hair-trigger impulses.",neutral,0.995
"Why Elon Musk Would Kill Tesla’s $25,000 Model 2 - The Autopian",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE0tb2NUUTJodDdzcVVjV1dYckNtcjN1dHRMWWI3RDZjUENyZzM3M0YyeTMzdnc4b2JjRWRpUkNjNG82TVZpMVM4TzNON3RyOGRVbkZDcWxhYlRfRExtbThObEZab3FoQzJlY1JWRm9RdkFaUjVIY2EtTWRnVVNSYUU?oc=5,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","I say this because I’ve got to talk about Elon Musk due to this  this  Reuters  report  that says Tesla killed its affordable car program. You know, the one that CEO Elon Musk  said would happen in three years way  back in 2020, would be mostly autonomous and would cost under $25,000? The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   Obviously, that didn’t happen and, instead, it seems like a lot of Tesla’s talent has gone into making the Cybertruck. Here’s the key part of the article:     Two sources said they learned of Tesla’s decision to scrap the Model 2 in a meeting attended by scores of employees, with one of them saying the gathering happened in late February. As the report also notes, this was long a dream of Elon Musk. He was supposed to sell expensive EVs to part of the market to fund the development of a cheaper EV for everyone else, thus making Tesla the biggest carmaker in the world. I don’t know, but there a few reasons why Tesla might at least delay the $25,000 car and they range from the reasonable to the insane. While cheap EVs are the way forward for increasing EV market share, it may not be the best way forward for Tesla. What more could Tesla bring? Ford is  already pushing ahead with ex-Tesla folks to build its cheap car , so even with trade barriers to China, the company might end up in a situation where Tesla has real competition. The Sad Reason Why Musk Might Kill The $25,000 Car   Source: Tesla   Given the known timing of when Musk was hoping to deliver the Model 2, is it possible that Musk shifted too many resources to build the Cybertruck? The  Reuters  article makes a reference to it:   If Tesla had moved forward with the low-cost car, it wouldn’t have arrived on the market until the latter half of 2025, by the company’s estimate. Tesla is late to the segment in part because of a pivotal decision by Musk. In 2020, after releasing its hit crossover, the Model Y, Tesla focused on the highly experimental Cybertruck instead of an affordable car. Tesla’s timeline and business model for robotaxis remain unclear. He has said Tesla, the world’s most valuable automaker, would be “worth basically zero” without achieving full self-driving capability. Tesla-watcher/investor Sawyer Merritt has a theory along these lines, that the cheap car isn’t canceled, just that the robotaxi part of it is taking precedence:     Musk responded to the above tweet with the big eyes emoji, so maybe? The Truly Insane Reason Why Musk Might Kill The $25,000 Car   What if Tesla’s business isn’t really cars? Jonas, the analyst mentioned above, references this in his note:     “While we do not expect Tesla to ‘exit’ the auto business any time soon, we do believe the company’s scientific endeavors can and will, over time, expand far beyond the automotive paradigm. Many investors may not be prepared for the change.”     What I think Jonas is trying to say here is that it might suck to own Tesla stock for a while as Tesla concedes market share to everyone else while trying to get AI to work, or whatever.",neutral,0.994

Tesla Had A Tough First Quarter   As  Zach covered a few days ago,  Tesla announced disappointing first quarter deliveries. I’m focusing on the US market, so I’m using the estimates from goodcarbadcar.net (Tesla doesn’t share US figures). Most of us following Tesla know about the massive 29.7% price drop in the first quarter of last year, but I don’t see much discussion that prices have dropped an additional 19% in the last 12 months, resulting in a staggering 43% net price drop for the best selling car in the world! The lower price enabled her to afford a second Tesla, even though the gas saving are minimal on that car due to only driving it about 6,000 miles a year. This is the whole “should Tesla advertise or just cut prices” debate. Even though Tesla does advertise now, most people still don’t know about the lower prices. [ Editor’s note: Also, from my experience, most Tesla advertising doesn’t emphasize the lower prices. —Zachary Shahan ]   Many people (including Elon Musk) say the increase in interest rates is responsible for the drop in Tesla sales, but if that was the case, we would see poorer sales from other makes, so I think this is a minor issue. So, some people who would have bought a Tesla have either bought a different brand of electric or just bought a gas car because they don’t want a non-Tesla until those brands us the NACS connector and have access to most superchargers. Hyundai is halfway between the Tesla (we only make electric cars) and Toyota (we like hybrids) strategy. Hyundai (and Kia) have been much faster at pushing leasing to take advantage of that loophole than Tesla. Hyundai was surprised by the details of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), so it is at a major disadvantage to Tesla, which has EV manufacturing in the US and some battery contracts that have enough materials from the right countries to get the full tax credit for most of their cars. In my opinion, Tesla has the best cars and the best plans, Hyundai has pretty good plans, and Toyota has the worst, but the first quarter has taught us that markets don’t move in straight lines.",positive,0.998

Tesla's Mexico Gigafactory is still a key piece of the company's future - Business Insider,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQVHMyYmI4dVo2SWJsX1ZmUGZjNmgzakZPQlBqRENkbVZDbTg4QU5DVkVEMUFSWUJTOWt2VUgxVEViUjBhR2owLUxlTEt3aU11ZE03UWlHMkVhbnZXQXRpYjZEVDNnRHAwcHB2by01bDdxZjRGZmRmVzJpMVcwVHFqUEN5WklkUQ?oc=5,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla's Mexico  Gigafactory  is taking longer to come online than expected, but building south of the US border is still likely to be a key part of the company's future. An assembly plant in Mexico, where workers are typically paid less than in the US and which is closer to Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, may offer a cheaper manufacturing hub in North America that can still supply major markets like the US with more inexpensive vehicles. That's especially important as Tesla aims to keep its costs down to  protect its profit margins  at a time when customers are more price-conscious and more likely to consider hybrids over electric vehicles. Tesla is starting to  feel the heat  of a nearly yearlong slowdown in the electric-vehicle market. The results reflect the extent to which Elon Musk's plan to slash the prices of his most popular vehicles can work in a changing EV market. Shoppers today  are looking for more practical green-car options, gravitating more toward legacy brands and hybrids than pure electric vehicles — the only type of car Tesla sells. Tesla's 'genius move' During an  investor presentation  in March 2023, Tesla announced plans to start manufacturing in Mexico. At the time, Sandy Munro, an automotive-manufacturing expert, called it a "" genius move "" and speculated that a long-awaited $25,000 Tesla would be built at the factory. Musk later said the affordable Tesla would first be built in Texas and could move to Mexico in the future. Despite Musk's reassurance this week that an  affordable Tesla is still on the way , he emphasized that it would be built on an existing assembly line, not a new one. Bloomberg reported  in February that the automotive CEO had invited some of Tesla's Chinese suppliers of its Shanghai plant to Mexico.",neutral,0.995
"Tesla profits drop 55%, company says EV sales ‘under pressure’ from hybrids - TechCrunch",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxObGw4OWN1T25KUnU5dXZpeEs0RVV4NUVfQkhVUjRSWnNYaW1LLVdpakhmUUYydlM1M1RvaHJiRkxwc2RSbzNOSWdoVEdFVlpvaVVLcHQtdEttNlVqSXpqYmhvMmJQV05YVnktcGV5dXljNFplSjAxU2k5UVhXc2hCTDFXNExTQ1dBN1dKNmxVc0QzdWdob2tUOFBFMU9WcG9RTWRjaUJaWThGUQ?oc=5,"Tue, 23 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla  profits fell 55% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter from the same year-ago period as a protracted EV price-cutting strategy and “ several   unforeseen   challenges”  cut into the automaker’s bottom line. Tesla reported revenue of  $21.3 billion  in the first quarter, a 9% drop from the first quarter of 2023. Tesla reported operating income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, a 54% decrease from the same year-ago period. Tesla also noted that global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs. On the upside, that hybrid approach has meant automakers continue to buy regulatory credits; Tesla earned $442 million in zero emissions tax credits in the first quarter. “The EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug in hybrids instead,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in opening remarks on the earnings call. “We believe this is not the right strategy, and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.”   Shares pop on future promises   The results, posted after markets closed Tuesday,  sent shares up as much as 12%  following the release as investors appeared to be more focused on Tesla’s forward-looking remarks about future products, including an upended product roadmap to bring  multiple cheaper vehicles  to market by 2025. Despite the downward trend in profits, Tesla used the first-quarter report to focus on the future, namely about using AI to make advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on a next-generation vehicle platform. “And we’ll be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.”   The cost of price cuts   Tesla has seen EV sales grow over the past several years, topping out to a new record of  1.8 million vehicles  in 2023. Tesla delivered  386,810 vehicles  in the first quarter of 2024, down 20% from the 484,507 it delivered in the final quarter of 2023. This wasn’t just a quarter-over-quarter blip either; Tesla delivered 8.5% fewer cars than the first quarter of 2023. Tesla warned in January that growth of its vehicle sales “may be notably lower” in 2024, noting at that time it was between “two major growth waves” and prepping for the launch of a new vehicle platform to build a smaller EV that costs around $25,000. In the meantime, Tesla’s only new model is the  expensive (and fussy) Cybertruck ; the company has launched new variants on existing models, including the  Tesla Model 3 Performance . Two high-profile executives —  Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development  — also left the company. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said Tuesday during the earnings call that the  savings   generated  from the workforce reduction is  expected   to   be   well   in   excess   of  $ 1  billion   on   an   annual   basis. Tesla noted that most of that growth came from increased Megapack deployments, which was partially offset by a decrease in solar installs. That revenue source should increase as more automakers, including Ford, GM, Rivian and VW  adopt Tesla’s technology  known as North American Charging Standard. Tesla Semi delayed   While Tesla pushes forward on autonomy and a new product roadmap, other projects continue to be delayed. Mass production of the Tesla Semi, which was first  revealed in November 2017 , is now being pushed out another year. The Tesla Semi, which was originally planned to go into production in 2019, has been repeatedly delayed. The first production Semi vehicles are now planned for late 2025 with external customers starting in 2026, according to Tesla. Tesla is finalizing the engineering for the Semi to allow for “super cost effective high production,” according to information shared on the call. The company shared in its first-quarter earnings report that it has started construction of a Tesla Semi factory near its so-called Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada.",neutral,0.995

Below I've rounded up a few things I really miss about my  Tesla , and a couple of things I enjoy about the Corolla, after leaving gas vehicles behind years ago. Three things I hate about not having my Tesla                              I have to carry a key again        Over the last two weeks, I've had to get reacquainted with various aspects of driving a gas car again, but perhaps the one area where I've struggled with the most is with carrying a key fob. With my Tesla, my phone is my key. I've been spoiled by the ease of getting in and out of my Tesla, and I'm not sure if it's a habit I can break. Tesla once looked invincible, now it looks merely mortal. I constantly monitored my Tesla's charge level, using various apps to calculate what my projected range would be for long drives and trying to figure out when and where to charge. With the Corolla, I've found myself looking at the gas gauge with the same range anxiety feeling I'd had during my rookie year with the Tesla. Two things I love about my temporary Corolla                              Toyota's lane assist tech is pretty good        In my Tesla, I use Full Self Driving for probably 90% of my driving. It wasn't quite as smooth as my Tesla, but I have no complaints about Toyota's Safety Sense driver assistance features. Wireless Apple CarPlay is fantastic        I've long been against the idea of Tesla or Rivian integrating Android Auto or Apple CarPlay into their vehicles. There are many reasons I feel this way, which I'll spare you from for now, but the gist of it is: Tesla and Rivian aren't traditional car companies, and because they're building the entire product from the ground up, they should own their software and hardware experience -- much like Apple does. I still don't want CarPlay in my Tesla, but there's a small part of me that misses it.",negative,0.985

The revenue drop and profitability slide follow a  weaker-than-expected quarter of sales  for Tesla. In Q1, Tesla reported 386,810 global deliveries, well below estimates of 449,080, and produced 433,371 vehicles, also below estimates of 452,976. Tesla did note in the first quarter report that Cybertruck production hit 1000 units a week in April. Story Continues   The difference of around 46,500 vehicles produced versus sold  led to concerns of demand waning  globally for Tesla vehicles, which in turn has led to round after round of price cuts. On Monday, Tesla cut prices for vehicles in the US and China, leading to weakness in the stock during the day. Nonetheless, Tesla confirmed that the long-awaited next-generation platform would underpin a sub-$30,000 mainstream EV — dubbed the Model 2. That's a huge deal for investors, many of whom see the low-cost EV as a volume play for Tesla. Tesla said upcoming vehicles, including the affordable models, would use aspects of the next-gen platform as well as existing platforms, allowing them to be built on the same assembly lines as current vehicles.

I have just one single Tesla, not 100, 1000, or one million. You need hardware that works well beyond 99% of the time in every FSD Tesla on the road in order to have a safe robotaxi service. There’s an argument that as the neural nets get to work, as Tesla processes more data and improves, the AI can operate under more and more difficult conditions even with current hardware. Again, when Tesla’s cameras and FSD system face these problems, it could find a way to work around them just like humans do, but I’m not confident of that at the moment. We can all have different opinions regarding Tesla AI’s ability to solve the problem in time. As I was scanning X/Twitter this morning to see what Tesla discussions are happening there, I also ran across these two tweets:       1. Our Tesla jumped out into the middle of the road and had a path planned that would have no doubt resulted in a major traffic accident with the fast moving SUV, had my wife not slammed on the brakes.”   This one feels like something that would be solved and avoided in the future with growing data and processing. And what would that do for Tesla FSD progress, by the way? I do not claim to know what is going to happen with Tesla FSD and potential robotaxis in the coming months and years. However, if I was forced to make a guess right now, I’d guess that Tesla’s approach is not going to work (again) and will need some serious restructuring. Many people were defending Tesla’s approach and claiming Elon knew best (as he always does) when it came to the approach the company was using then. Should we have just trusted him and the Tesla team he was working with in 2020, or in 2018? You could say what Tesla was doing then led to where we are now in a clear and useful way, and that we had to start there to get here. Yes, the system is better today than it once was, but it is still so far from robotaxi capability that I think it takes a very large leap of faith — a reckless leap of faith — to assume that Tesla is now on the perfect path, or right path, to robotaxi capability.",positive,0.944

What investments can Tesla make to restore its plummeting industry leadership? Its chief focus, CEO Elon Musk made clear, was building partly autonomous robotaxis—its own model of the robocabs that have been crashing their way around San Francisco. More from Harold Meyerson   More broadly, the days when Tesla was the only, and then the dominant, player in the electric-car market are long gone. Even without its lassitude in producing more affordable vehicles, even without the siren songs of space shots and Twitter calumnies that have distracted Musk from his cars, Tesla’s role in the market has inevitably shrunk as U.S., Asian, and European competitors have scaled up their own production. So, are a chastened Tesla and Musk redirecting the company’s resources into building a better, more affordable car? All this is chump change, of course, compared to what Musk has asked Tesla to pay him. Why does Musk, already the world’s richest human, want a $56 billion paycheck from Tesla? Some reporting has suggested he wants to recoup the roughly $44 billion he shelled out to purchase Twitter—a purchase that was bad for Tesla, bad for Twitter, and bad for truth. Why is Tesla’s board so insistent on shoveling the equivalent of the economic value of Montana to Musk? Which makes clear why Tesla’s board announced earlier this month that, notwithstanding a Delaware court’s ruling that struck down a previous version of this payout, they were going to submit it again to the company’s shareholders. There is, however, one positive by-product to Elon Musk’s determination to grab $56 billion from his shareholders and employees: It strengthens the case—growing stronger every day—for expropriating the fortunes of the rich.",positive,0.993

The upcoming ride-hailing service will allow users the ability to conveniently call for a Tesla vehicle, adjust the temperature inside the car, track its location in real-time, and customise their music:   Screenshot   (Credit:  Tesla )   Tesla’s ambitions with robotaxis have been public knowledge since 2019 when CEO Elon Musk declared that he was “very confident” the company would commence operating a fleet of driverless vehicles by the end of 2020. Under this scheme, Tesla will manage the majority of their fleet, but individual car owners would also have control over whether or not they choose to participate in the program. In an effort to ensure maximum safety, Musk stressed that every Tesla vehicle will be equipped with sophisticated sensors capable of detecting potential hazards around the car and alert passengers accordingly. Tesla’s new ride-hailing service will also offer car owners additional revenue streams by allowing them to monetise their vehicles during off hours when they aren’t in use—with the company taking a percentage of the profits and passing on the rest to the vehicle owner. Readers may want to take this claim with a pinch of salt, but Musk predicts that each participating Tesla vehicle could generate an estimated $30,000 in gross earnings annually for its owners. Full details of Tesla’s autonomous ride-hailing service are set to be revealed at an event in August.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, said in separate statements to NBC News that Tesla hadn’t applied for the two permits it would need to operate a driverless car service in the country’s most populous state. Two other states that regulate robotaxis, Arizona and Nevada, also said they had not heard from Tesla about its plans. The lack of permits — or any attempt to acquire them — raises questions about how quickly Tesla would be able to get a robotaxi service up and running. “Tesla’s a long way away from getting that approval,” said Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry. Representatives for Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. The DMV handles permits to deploy autonomous equipment on the road, and Tesla currently has the  lowest-level permit , allowing it to test autonomous vehicles with human drivers present. “Tesla has not applied for a deployment permit with the DMV,” the department said in a statement in response to questions. If Tesla were to deploy robotaxis that are autonomous, it added, “the DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits.”  The CPUC handles permits to operate robotaxis as businesses, including for tech startup Waymo’s services in  San Francisco  and  Los Angeles . Tesla has no CPUC permit and hasn’t applied, the commission said. “If Tesla wanted to provide a robotaxi service they’d need to follow the same rules as other such companies (i.e., DMV approval for driverless testing/deployment before seeking a CPUC permit). Templeton said it’s possible Tesla’s timeline for approval could be shorter than eight months — or longer. “It could also be that they think Tesla is premature and they never approve it,” he said. Tesla has approached the challenge of self-driving technology differently from Waymo, for example. Tesla has relied less on expensive hardware sensors  such as LiDAR , and it has deployed driver assistance systems in stages nationwide while Waymo and General Motors subsidiary Cruise focused on mastering small geographic areas, such as parts of the Phoenix and San Francisco metro areas. Tesla does not yet have publicly released technology for a car to drive without human supervision. Each state handles robotaxi regulation differently, and it’s possible that Tesla could seek to launch a service without California, although it would mean cutting out a major market. Tesla was the No. Musk hinted at his plans in a brief post late Friday afternoon on X, writing: “Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8.”  He gave no details about his plans, but the post boosted the morale of Tesla fans on social media who had watched the company get battered in the business media and on Wall Street. Three days earlier, Tesla shares fell after the company reported a  drop  in deliveries, but on Monday, the next trading day after Musk’s post, Tesla’s share price rose 4.9%,  Reuters reported . Tesla message boards have been rife with speculation about what Musk’s August announcement would be. In 2019,  he discussed plans  to launch a robotaxi fleet using Tesla vehicles that people had leased and then returned. Musk has also  talked about  a robotaxi service with decentralized ownership, in which Tesla owners could rent out their cars for fares. Tesla may need authorization from various states or localities to operate a nationwide robotaxi fleet. The Arizona DOT “has not received any TNC paperwork from Tesla,” spokesperson Bill Lamoreaux said in an email. “That said, it is our understanding that Tesla is neither operating autonomous vehicles nor a transportation network company in Arizona at this time.”  The department has also not received paperwork from Tesla for a second, separate  process  to self-certify autonomous vehicles, he said. The Nevada DMV has not received paperwork from Tesla to begin the certification process, said Eli Rohl, a department spokesperson, but he said the process doesn’t need to take long. “If Tesla was interested in getting certified or permitted in Nevada, they could likely do so in short order,” he said in an email. Tesla already has a rocky relationship with California regulators.",neutral,0.996

As first reported by  EV blog Electrek , CEO Elon Musk emailed staff confirming a ""more than 10%"" headcount reduction following  prior reports  that layoffs could hit as much as 20% of staff. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done.”   With Tesla’s headcount sitting at around 140,000 workers globally, the reduction is likely to affect at least 14,000 workers. Tesla stock closed down 5.6% on Monday to hit its lowest closing level in nearly a year. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price   •   USD               After hours: 7:59:59 PM EDT     For Tesla, the layoffs come following a  disappointing Q1 delivery report  that showed the company missed widely on consensus estimates and built up supply in excess of 46,000 vehicles. This implies that Tesla is feeling the impact of slowing EV demand, both in the US and globally, after reporting its first year-over-year quarterly decline in deliveries since 2020. Noted Tesla bull Dan Ives  at Wedbush Securities warned the layoffs were a negative sign for Tesla, as seen in Monday’s move lower. “This is an ominous signal that speaks to tough times ahead for Tesla as Musk navigated this Category 5 storm,” Ives said in a comment to Yahoo Finance. “Demand has been soft globally, and this is an unfortunately necessary move for Tesla to cut costs with a softer growth outlook.”     People walk to the Tesla Gigafactory for electric cars in Gruenheide near Berlin, Germany, on March 13, 2024. Investors and analysts believed part of Tesla's big growth story would be its long-rumored next-gen vehicle that would start at around $25,000; however,  reports last week suggested Tesla had canceled  the vehicle. Musk responded to the report claiming it was false and revealed that a Tesla robotaxi debut would be coming on Aug. Tesla is expected to report earnings on Tuesday, April 23, and will likely provide more commentary on the layoffs, their impact on its financials, and the company's near-term demand.",neutral,0.987

Tesla should be expanding employment and investment in more affordable EVs and they’re doing the opposite because they prioritize their stock price and profits over responding to climate change.”   Lynne Vincent , associate professor at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management, studies industrial and labor relations and organizational behavior. She writes: “Given the changes in the electric vehicle market and the increased viability of competitors, the strain that Tesla is feeling is not surprising. Tesla might have been an early mover in the electric vehicle market, but they are not the only mover now. Tesla is facing external threats from competitors and internal challenges such as Rohan Patel, senior global director of public policy and business development, and Andrew Baglino, senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, leaving the organization. Tesla will have to make some choices about how to manage these changes and support their remaining workforce. If Tesla is lucky, their exits were planned, and Tesla has a leadership succession plan in place.”",neutral,0.996

Tesla highlights rights of uncontacted tribes in report – a “wake-up call” for businesses and governments - Survival International,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTFBsWE1KREdHbFBVZWJ2ZmhUalRJOFdSUXlYeFM0eGR0Q3BlWFFZeFBoZk5mQVdxM1VScGZTNTB3QWtyUVJQOTBUNDdWU0U0X0JkZjF5YVFWMFJWX0tS?oc=5,"Thu, 23 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla announced today that the company is exploring “the need for the establishment of a no-go zone for mining to protect indigenous and human rights, particularly those of uncontacted communities”, demonstrating that the rights of uncontacted Indigenous peoples can be a major business concern, campaigners say. Tesla’s statement linking the rights of uncontacted Indigenous peoples to the need for a “no-go zone” — where no mining or other activities can take place — is the latest sign that global pressure over the rights of such peoples is having an impact on companies’ supply chain decisions. Tesla's announcement in its  2023 Impact Report  is featured in a chapter about social and environmental impacts in Indonesia, and has huge implications for nickel mining in the country. Tesla, which is not currently sourcing nickel from WBN, made clear that it expects its suppliers to only operate on Indigenous people’s lands with their Free, Prior and Informed Consent. The Tesla statement follows a recent decision by major Italian leather manufacturer Pasubio to change suppliers after campaigners revealed some of its leather was sourced from illegal cattle ranches on uncontacted Ayoreo people’s lands in Paraguay. More than 20,000 Survival supporters around the world have emailed Eramet, BASF, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others, calling on the companies to take a stand against nickel and cobalt mining on the territory of the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa in Halmahera. Now that public awareness and concern is mounting, companies and governments cannot keep ignoring this — as recent statements by Pasubio and now Tesla make abundantly clear. Survival is calling on all electric vehicle companies, including BMW, Volkswagen, and BYD, to commit to not source any materials from uncontacted tribes’ territories and for Tesla to make this their formal policy. In recent years, the Indonesian government has been trying to attract Tesla to invest in their nickel market. Tesla’s statement is likely to cause shockwaves in Indonesia.

David shared details of how he found and reported the security flaws to Tesla, but also discussed the seriousness of today’s cyber threat actors; what he sees as the biggest cybersecurity challenges for organizations today; and how he counsels executives on the risk. Teneo Risk:  Let's talk about the Tesla hack. I'm not a car guy, I'm a computer guy and Tesla is essentially a computer on wheels. However, I didn’t have a Tesla, nor did I know anyone with a Tesla, but every Tesla connects to the Internet for software and application updates which gave me my starting point to explore Teslas from home. After some research, I discovered that every Tesla connects to something called the “mothership,” which is the main server that all the Teslas connect to and communicate with. Further, I found a specific open-source logging tool called TeslaMate which lets Tesla owners monitor data, including a car’s energy consumption, location history and music history among other things. Teneo Risk:  How did you find Tesla owners? Many Tesla owners name their cars – sometimes using funny or creative names. When I found a match, I reached out to the owner on Twitter (now X) who at first didn’t believe that I had access to his Tesla. This was when I knew that Tesla had a potentially serious issue, because I could literally figure out where the car was. Teneo Risk:  Did you contact Tesla? and Canada, and sent it to Tesla.

Theo Leggett Business correspondent, BBC News Getty Images Last month Tesla had to recall thousands of its Cybertrucks over safety concerns around their accelerator pedals There was a time when it seemed Tesla could do no wrong. So is all of this just a bump in the road, or are the wheels coming off the Tesla bandwagon? ""It's about breaking a spell,"" explained Elon Musk to a specially invited audience at Tesla's California factory back in June 2012. Musk was speaking at the launch of the new Tesla Model S, a car he insisted would shatter that illusion. Getty Images Tesla's 2012 release of the Model S transformed the electric car market At the time electric cars had a long-standing reputation for being slow, uninspiring and impractical, with very limited range. Since then, Tesla has launched four more models, including the Model X SUV, the ""affordable"" Model 3 and Model Y, and the Cybertruck. ""When Tesla first emerged, it had an exciting new product, a charismatic CEO, and it came across as really pioneering,"" he explains. ""Basically, the world has caught up with Tesla,"" he says. It overtook Tesla to become the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars at the end of 2023, although a subsequent drop in sales allowed Tesla to regain its crown in the first three months of this year. According to independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt, this has certainly had an impact on Tesla. ""Finance ministers who were previously happy to offer attractive incentives for the purchase of a battery electric vehicle in a market environment that appeared bare-shelved, with essentially a Tesla or a Tesla on offer, are now slamming their purses shut,"" he says. EV sales there fell sharply in the first three months of this year, with Tesla suffering a 36% drop compared to the same period in 2023. The question now is whether Tesla can regain lost momentum. Its maverick chief executive, Elon Musk appears to be pinning his hopes on the company becoming a leader in vehicle autonomy - a provider of driverless robot taxis. Getty Images Elon Musk is betting on Tesla being the leader in driverless cars Yet Musk has been talking up the prospect of full autonomy a very long time. Tesla's ""Full Self Driving"" package remains rather less than its title suggests - it is still a ""hands on"" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times. The quest for full autonomy does fit with Tesla's identity as a technology business, rather than a traditional carmaker. Meanwhile, Tesla has been cutting prices to boost sales, and cutting costs and reducing headcount to improve its margins.",neutral,0.996

The campus is located around 18 miles from the Tesla location. Much has changed at Tesla since its CEO, the  unpredictable and “fickle” Elon Musk , announced the $4.5 billion investment in March of last year. In January,  China’s BYD overtook Tesla  as the world’s leading electric vehicle (EV) maker, offering cheaper cars. Tesla announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce and even the job offers it had in Nuevo León disappeared from its webpage. Mariceu Erthal (Bloomberg) The story of the Tesla investment that is yet to happen (and that, many speculate, will not) runs parallel to the failure of the governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García, to deliver the incentives that he promised Musk. The billboards that tower over highways in the northern city with the Tesla logo are a reminder of how García managed, briefly, to ride the wave of inertia generated by the announcement of the investment to make a run for the presidency. He was also unable to convince the Federation to send resources for the works promised to Tesla. Nearshoring Since Tesla’s big factory announcement, other companies have said they’re investing in Mexico, though without making a big splash. And in February, Amazon announced a $5 billion investment, larger than Tesla’s, through its cloud services subsidiary AWS. The biggest winners have been the northern and central states, better placed to receive companies, which is why President Andrés Manuel López Obrador fought to bring the Tesla plant, which was supposed to assemble the firm’s cheapest model,  to southern Mexico  instead. López Obrador during a meeting with Tesla executives at the National Palace, on March 8, 2023. Presidencia Perhaps indirectly, Tesla imposed its conditions by not being willing to move the plant to the south of the country as the federal government wanted, says Matías Gómez Leautaud, analyst for Eurasia Group in Mexico City. “This most likely caused a sting within the López Obrador Administration, which responded with ‘okay, go where you wish, but you’re on your own.’” Record spending Governor García found the resources to start the works that are already being carried out near Tesla’s land in Santa Catarina, but now, it’s the company that does not have the cash flow it had a year ago. Johnson is famous in Wall Street circles for his skepticism toward Tesla and Musk. He has studied the company’s financials and issued bearish recommendations for Tesla shares since 2018 and, in his estimates, the true value of one share of the automaker is close to $22. In other words, Johnson and his team believe Tesla stock is 90% overvalued. The announcement of the plant in Mexico was made in March 2023, at a time when Tesla’s stock was falling, and Johnson believes that Musk went ahead to announce the project without having a concrete plan in the hopes that it would boost the stock. Christopher Goodney (Bloomberg) According to the analyst, Tesla has sold fewer cars than it has produced in seven of the last eight quarters, meaning they are selling only 75% of their inventory. For Aguilar, the Udem professor, even if Tesla abandons the project, someone else would take his place. “The fact that they’re building all this infrastructure for the factory and that the government has given in to all the demands that Tesla made, that is an opportunity served on a silver platter for any foreign capital,” says Aguilar.

Tesla fires team expanding Supercharger network.

The layoffs caught many by surprise, considering Tesla’s Supercharger network is  dominant in the United States ,  often the only chargers in many regions . “At the end of the day, I can see how — from the perspective of Tesla — you would make a decision like this,” says Suarez, the Jean C. Suarez also lectures about Tesla in an Innovation Driven Strategy course at the university. Tempel professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Northeastern, says Tesla’s decision “makes sense” for the car company. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University   And while the decision  leaves many drivers worrying about how and where  they are going to charge their electric vehicles, Suarez believes consumers will ultimately benefit from Tesla’s move. “It will incentivize other networks to grow faster, and other companies to start investing in their Supercharger network and in competing supercharging networks to be built.”   The Tesla Supercharger network is the dominant fast-charging network in the United States, with roughly 6,000 station locations and about 28,000 charging ports. Elon Musk said the firings included the group that had worked on building new Supercharger stations. Tesla, he said, would finish stations under construction. The Supercharger network was for years proprietary, meaning only Tesla cars could use it. But Suarez says a few recent developments have made the idea of continuing to build and grow a nationwide charging network less attractive to Tesla. First, the electric vehicle market “matured” — Tesla is no longer the only player in the game. “Tesla enjoyed a situation that was very unusual — they were basically left alone for 10 years,” Suarez says. “When competition came, as in the last year when Tesla had  to slash prices , sales  were down ,  10% of its workforce was laid off ,  and its stock fell , you transition to a different state in the industry — a state in which efficiency is super important.”   In other words, Tesla needs to cut costs. Perhaps foreseeing this, Tesla forged deals with other automakers to allow non-Tesla cars to use the Supercharger network with adapters. But it would cost money for Tesla to adjust, maintain and expand its charging network — costs that might outweigh the money Tesla could make from charging customers. Ultimately, facing a cash crunch, a standardized mature market for EVs and a maturing market for EV chargers, Tesla had a decision to make, Suarez says — essentially, did it want to be a car company or a charger company? Tesla appears to have  chosen the former, betting on autonomous vehicles for its next market disruption. Of course, for the EV driver, Tesla’s decision is disconcerting; probably also for the environmentalist.",positive,0.998

But Tesla has a specialty and that is turning the impossible into merely late,” joked Priestley. The other sticking point for many fleets, charging time, was also addressed, with the Semi program manager pointing to the fact that Tesla can offer megawatt level fast charging that is reliable and safe. Tesla has already deployed this in the field and is actively using it in vehicle testing and with customers. They can swap one for one in operations.”   For example, PepsiCo ran  more than 1,000 miles  with one of its three Tesla Semis in a 24-hour period during NCAFE’s Run on Less Electric demonstration last year, with the other two totaling 754 and 808 miles, respectively. Tesla is also “putting our money where our mouth is,” introducing the Semi into its own supply chain and operations by hauling battery packs from its Gigafactory in Nevada down to support its Fremont factory operations in California. They have seen so much success that Tesla is in the process of delivering 50 more Semis to its Fresno, California, facility, as well as the mega charging to support it. At the end of April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk  laid off the team  responsible for building EV charging stations. “To be very clear, charging is core to Tesla. Pointing to the fact that historically Tesla restricts the information shared with the media, Neandross asked what changed. “When we first unveiled this product in 2017, Tesla was a fraction of the company that it is today. All of that effort like that has really been emblematic of Tesla’s overall growth and maturity. “We really liked to push the vehicle to its absolute limit, and it sweated, but it did really well.”   The Tesla Semi will be on display at this year’s Ride and Drive for ACT Expo attendees to experience.",neutral,0.996

Then we learned that Tesla really  isn’t a car company at all . Three years ago, Tesla had achieved a cult-like status among its customers. Is The Cult Of Tesla Next? George Santayana , whose real name was Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás, was a Harvard philosopher who is widely credited with being the first to say, “Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.” Elon Musk is an amazing person who has accomplished wonderful things. Here’s the point of today’s screed — What happened to Saturn could happen to Tesla, and Musk seems completely oblivious to that possibility. Recently he said Tesla is not a car company. Now suddenly that dream is off the table and we are all supposed to pivot to Tesla being an AI and robotaxi company? To some, Tesla today is little more than a classic Wall Street pump and dump scheme. Put A Real Person In Charge Of Tesla   A recent op-ed by Mack Hogan for  Inside EVs  advocates for putting an adult in charge of the car manufacturing side of Tesla. “And yet America can’t afford for the same fate to befall Tesla’s auto-making efforts.

The Elon Musk-led company  lost its title  as the world’s top EV seller to Chinese EV maker BYD. Then in Q1, Tesla reported its first YoY  sales decline  since 2020, as well as  drops  in  profit and revenue , amid waning EV demand and growing competition. The revelation that the Department of Justice is  investigating  whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud related to the  company’s claims  about its self-driving vehicle tech, which is also  under scrutiny  from federal auto safety regulators. Tesla’s stock is down about 30% year to date. But perhaps most puzzling of all was the news in April that  Tesla had laid off  nearly all of its Supercharger team—500 employees who worked on the company’s industry-leading EV charging business. (Tesla later  hired back some  of the employees.) Basically, it’s been a rough year for Tesla. The upshot, according to industry experts, is that competitors—from traditional automakers to EV startups to charging providers—now have a clear chance at stealing some of Tesla’s thunder. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Try and come for my market share “It’s an opportunity for their competitors to continue to claw away at Tesla’s market share,” K.C. He pointed to recent Escalent data indicating that while Tesla is still “very highly considered” by consumers who are likely to buy an EV for their next vehicle, there’s a big difference this year in how many other brands they’re also considering. “In previous years, it was often only Tesla or Tesla and one other brand that were being considered for an EV,” he said. “And this year it’s Tesla and, and, and…It’s a lot more competitive today than it was even last year.” Because consumers tend to favor brands they already recognize and trust, the opportunity may be most ripe for legacy automakers, he said. Boyce thinks it could be especially opportune for a pair of sister brands: “Hyundai and Kia are really well-positioned given the troubles at Tesla. “As Elon Musk has pointed out many times,” John Tomlinson, director of research at M Science, said, “there’s very few auto companies that started up and survived over the past 100 years.” Supercharger slash After the Supercharger news sent shockwaves through the EV sector, Musk  said  that Tesla still plans to invest $500 million this year in expanding its charging network. Even so, experts say the cutbacks will have major implications for the rollout of federally funded charging station projects, the pace of EV adoption, and the process of giving other brands access to Tesla’s network now that many are switching to Tesla’s charging connector. Tesla operates the largest charging network in the US, with some 25,000 Superchargers. Boyce predicted in  a LinkedIn post  that the layoffs would set off a wave of “serious buyers’ remorse (and frantic checking of contract terms)...at major OEMs” that had signed on to Tesla’s charging standard. He also wrote that he expects it to “delay Supercharger access for non-Tesla drivers that don’t currently have it.” Loren McDonald, CEO of research firm EVAdoption,  wrote  on LinkedIn that “a slowdown in Supercharger expansion could mean that the total number of new stations and ports opened in the US in 2024 and 2025 would see flat growth for three years.” “Fairly universally, people look at Superchargers as being the most available, the most convenient, and the fastest out there,” Boyce told Tech Brew. So I think this move by Tesla really imperils overall EV growth, not just Tesla’s EV growth, because of those buyer perceptions and concerns.” This provides competing charging networks like Electrify America with  an opportunity  to “step up and fill the game,” Boyce said, but “whether they will or not is another question.”",negative,0.996

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)       [Stay on top of transportation news:  Get TTNews in your inbox .]   Tesla Inc. must face a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging that it misled consumers about its cars’ self-driving capabilities, a fresh setback for the electric car maker just as CEO Elon Musk has staked the company’s future on autonomy. Tesla has been accused of overstating in 2016 that all its upcoming cars would have the “hardware needed for full self-driving capability” and would be able to drive themselves from Los Angeles to New York City by the end of 2017. “If Tesla meant to convey that its hardware was sufficient to reach high or full automation,” the complaint “plainly alleges sufficient falsity,” U.S. Musk declared in April that Tesla is “going balls to the wall for autonomy” while committing the car maker to a next-generation,  self-driving vehicle concept called the robotaxi . RELATED:   Tesla Stock Leaps on Reports of Chinese Approval of FSD   Meanwhile, the company faces federal probes into whether defects in its Autopilot driver-assistance feature have contributed to fatal crashes, as well as regulatory investigations and lawsuits over claims that it has overhyped its progress toward hands-free driving. RELATED:  Spate of Self-Driving Probes Points to Higher Safety Bar   Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. California resident Thomas LoSavio, who filed the complaint, says he bought a new Tesla in 2017 and paid an extra $8,000 for FSD. He alleged that statements by Tesla and Musk led him to believe that his car would have self-driving technology within a “reasonably short period.” But by 2022, Tesla hadn’t produced “anything even remotely approaching a fully self-driving car,” according to his complaint. LoSavio brought the complaint on behalf of anyone who bought or leased a new Tesla vehicle with Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD since 2016. Without ruling on the merits of his claims, the judge said LoSavio sufficiently alleged certain 2016 statements were misleading, such as all “Tesla vehicles produced in our factory now have full self-driving hardware” and that the cars would be able to drive themselves across the country “by the end of next year without the need for a single touch.”       	  			               While Lin allowed some negligence and fraud claims to proceed, she dismissed other claims.",neutral,0.993

Within hours after the company opened its pre-booking portal for India in April 2016, Gondal, a fan of Elon Musk and Tesla, paid $1,000 (then 66,237 rupees)   to pre-book the Tesla Model 3. But Gondal, who had driven a Tesla in the U.S. Gondal had to chase Tesla’s India executive over emails for six months before he received his refund in June 2023. Tesla still does not sell its cars in India — the  third-largest auto market  in the world. Some of them believe they won’t ever buy a Tesla now that there are other electric car models available in the country, while others want to wait until the company sets up a showroom and establishes robust post-sale services in India. I won’t trust [Musk] anymore.”   Bhawani’s pre-booking amount was refunded in February 2020 after his  YouTube video  about canceling his Tesla order garnered attention. “I found that normal people who canceled were not given refunds, and only influencers or people with [a] blue tick those days were refunded.”   In 2016, Tesla’s move to open pre-bookings for the Model 3 in India was received with much excitement. Within hours, several prominent tech and business leaders in the country had booked a Tesla, and posted about it on  social media . The carmaker even  registered an Indian subsidiary  in Bengaluru in January 2021, but there is still no official channel to buy a Tesla car directly from the company in India. When Musk announced his plan to visit India earlier this year, many anticipated that Tesla would  finally start talking about manufacturing  in the country. However, just two days before the scheduled trip, Musk called it off, owing to “ very heavy Tesla obligations .” He  made it to neighboring China  just a week later. “It is hard to estimate the arrival of Tesla cars on Indian roads unless there is clarity on tariffs.”   Until a couple of years ago, Tesla’s website showed a cancellation button when a prospective buyer logged in. But that option was “taken away” and replaced with an email ID, according to Nikhil Chaudhary, co-founder of a 5-year-old online community called Tesla Club India. Tesla Club India, which has more than 18,600 followers on X and hundreds of members on its WhatsApp group, routinely receives queries from people about how to cancel their bookings, Chaudhary told  Rest of World . Some prospective buyers have been pushed to track down Tesla  employees on LinkedIn  to move their cancellations along. He told  Rest of World  he got his $1,000 refund in January 2022, after months of following up with Tesla employees in Hong Kong and California. Tesla’s refund, after adjusting for inflation, should  amount to $1,300 in 2024 . “We joke about how much that $1,000 would’ve been worth had we invested in Tesla stock instead,” said Gondal, who now drives the Audi e-tron. In April 2016, Tesla’s share was priced $16 apiece. Owning a Tesla makes you look cool and stand out. For years, Tesla’s pain point in India has been the  exorbitant import duty , which nearly doubles the price of the cars. According to a   Financial Times  report , Tesla is sending U.S. Rest of World  reached out to Tesla’s press email as well as an India sales manager, Ankit Kesarwani, but did not receive a response. Tesla is “looking for a liberalized duty regime as well because it’s a huge undertaking they’re doing,” Mahesh Murthy, founder of venture capital fund Seedfund and digital marketing firm Pinstorm, told  Rest of World . Murthy pre-booked two Model 3 cars in 2016 and has not sought a refund, as he believes that Tesla is bullish on India but the circumstances haven’t so far aligned. According to Murthy, there’s been “intense lobbying” by members of the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers , an association of domestic vehicle makers, to keep Tesla out. Ankur Bisen, senior partner at consulting firm Technopak, told  Rest of World  that Tesla’s standing in the Indian EV ecosystem is not the same as eight years ago because there are multiple viable options in the market now. Beyond Tesla, we didn’t know anything about the EV space, right?” he said. “But today … the [Indian] government itself has come out with an EV report; there’s a lot of focus on two-wheeler EVs; Tata has taken a very bold stance on EVs and so have other auto manufacturers.”    According to Everest Group’s Joshi, Indians’ obsession with Tesla aligns with the global trend. Tesla “was ahead of its peers with its minimalist design, features, technology adoption, and focus on driving experience,” he said. “Owning a Tesla makes you look cool and stand out. People with money can spend a fortune just for these two aspects.”   Fans argue that Tesla has better range than most electric vehicles. German-made EVs from the likes of Audi and BMW, according to Arun Bhat, another co-founder of Tesla Club India, are internal combustion engine vehicles converted into EVs. [Tesla’s core technology] is leaps and bounds ahead of anything available in the market,” he told  Rest of World . Tesla’s over-the-air software updates make it worth the hype, according to the Tesla Club founders. “Tesla’s still updating the 2014 Model S … well past their warranty time,” Chaudhary  					  						said.",neutral,0.995

Within its portfolio, the  Tesla Model 3  sedan is priced similarly to the Model Y crossover. The Model 3 has been a popular mainstay and now, with the recent unveiling of the  Tesla Model 3 Performance , EV enthusiasts are enjoying the hype of a high-performance counterpart.

Tesla's Supercharger team layoffs perplex EV charging industry - Canary Media,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxQSU1OcFBjR28tVXY4T1RnYXRxOHRKVjJRMThkRzVaU0toY3FxbWx1cXFISGZwUVY5QnhxYlZ3T2c2R0dKLWNGdUpCZWVVNlltaHMzd3A3WDJ2RWVINXBlbjY2TWxoNXlMWkd1a1RGZFVzbW1xLTgwcFU2MzN5UjhQWEszLTFvcnNGZXhiWGZrMFdLS1RFM3V2MVVNVWZ4c2lfa2pyY0pwZWJMMTZ6dHlkNWw3SmN4LVJyMEwtN1hB?oc=5,"Thu, 02 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Still, without the Tesla charging team to shepherd the ongoing implementation of that technology across the industry,  ​ “ further improvements to standards and engagements across the industry will suffer,” Jameson wrote. Tesla’s layoffs also cast uncertainty over the projects the company has won with state transportation departments as part of the Biden administration’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure ( NEVI ) initiative, a  $ 5  billion formula grant program  created as part of the  2021  Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. According to data from the  EV  and charging analytics firm EVAdoption, Tesla won  18  percent of the projects awarded in the earliest round of  NEVI  awards for five states, worth about $ 8 . By February of this year, Tesla had racked up wins for projects in seven of  15  states that had announced their  NEVI  awards, according to EVAdoption data,  E & E News reported . To participate in the federal program, Tesla had to make its chargers usable by EVs beyond its own — a requirement seen as the impetus behind Tesla’s push to make  NACS  an open standard. But simply certifying the  NACS  technology standard is just the first step in a long and arduous process of working with multiple  EV  and charger manufacturers, technology providers, and public and private-sector partners, said Nigro of Atlas Public Policy — work that’s all new to the previously closed-off Tesla. “ There’s a lot of external communication that goes on between a charging provider like Tesla and utilities, state agencies, or automakers trying to get access to the Supercharger network,” Nigro said. Today, the country has  just over  41 , 000  fast-chargers  — and more than half were built by Tesla. What is  EV  charging worth to Tesla? The value of the Supercharger network to Tesla’s underlying  EV  business is hard to determine. From the perspective of its value as a marketing and sales tool,  ​ “ it’s likely a very sizable profit center for the company,” given its intangible but unquestioned value in convincing  EV  buyers to opt for a Tesla instead of a competing  EV , Nigro said. ​ “ Making money selling electrons is hard.”       Tesla doesn’t break out the performance of its Supercharger business unit in its broader financial reporting. But it’s far from clear that Tesla’s broader success in the increasingly competitive  EV  market relies on it keeping up the pace of the Supercharger deployments that got it to where it is today, said Pavel Molchanov, managing director and equity research analyst at Raymond James  &  Associates. “ A decade ago, when the entire  EV  value chain was in its infancy, it was reasonable for Tesla to invest its own capital in deploying chargers,” he said. “ So there is really no need for Tesla to spend money on what is fundamentally a low-margin commodity business: selling electricity to drivers,” Molchanov said. ​ “ If everything at Tesla were going perfectly, these additional expenses would not be a big deal. But given that Musk is aggressively trying to cut costs at the company, the Supercharger division is a logical area to look at.”       This short-term financial logic may be cold comfort to all the companies and public agencies that have wedded their  EV  charging expansion and reliability improvement plans to Tesla’s core technology. “ I do think there’s a drawback for people expecting Tesla to expand into their areas and to see these chargers deployed through  NEVI ,” she said.",neutral,0.995

On the production side, Tesla delivered over a million cars in a year for the first time ever. Tesla needed to increase capacity, so Elon Musk decided to build a factory in Mexico. At the time, Tesla estimated the factory would take  12 to 15 months  to build — slightly longer than the construction of Tesla’s factory in Shanghai. It doesn’t look like Tesla is in any hurry either,  telling suppliers  there’s no rush to deliver the factory’s equipment. Since Tesla’s Monterrey plant was announced, there’s been a global slowdown in demand for electric vehicles, as rising interest rates have made auto loans more expensive and gas-powered cars are  making a surprising comeback . Tesla has also seen heated new competition from  Chinese rivals like BYD and Aito , increasing the risk of oversupply across the industry. Tesla responded with price cuts, but the result is that it makes less profit from each car than it did in 2022, and there’s a lot less urgency to ramp up production. In the face of slackening demand and more mature competition, production volume isn’t Tesla’s biggest problem anymore. But it’s not just Tesla’s goals that have shifted. In one of her  few public statements on the Tesla plant , Sheinbaum has highlighted  concerns that it would exacerbate droughts  in the region. Beyond that, it’s too soon to say what Sheinbaum’s rise to power will mean for Tesla, but it’s an important unanswered question for the company. Most analysts believe Tesla will eventually finish the plant, simply because so much money has already been committed.",neutral,0.996

Also, this is one of the key challenges that made me a bit concerned about whether Tesla’s approach will lead to robotaxi capability. So, you have one model that eliminates one problem, but creates another problem .” I’ll come back to the rest of this segment later and how Tesla is dealing with the issue and trying to get around it, but I just want to emphasize here that it’s not simply the challenge of picking the best model, but the challenge of one problem getting fixed while another problem is created. Let’s return briefly to  what I wrote more than two years ago  when I started noticing this problem:   “Basically, I’ve been trying to understand reasons why Tesla FSD isn’t as good as I’d hoped it would be by now, and why it sometimes gets significantly worse. One potential issue is what I’m calling the ‘see-saw problem.’ If my theory is correct to any notable degree, it could be a critical fault in Tesla’s approach to widespread, generalized self driving. “My concern is that as Tesla corrects flagged issues and uploads new software to Tesla customer cars, those corrections create issues elsewhere. In other words, they are just playing software see-saw.”   I don’t know how much that was happening two years ago compared to today, but with Musk acknowledging that it’s happening, let’s take a look at how he says Tesla is trying to solve the problem. Overall, the big question with regard to identifying new better and better models, and overcoming the aforementioned “see-saw problem,” is how quickly Tesla can do this in order to roll out unsupervised full self driving and robotaxis. Obviously, Elon Musk is optimistic they’ll get there soon, but as even Musk states, he’s chronically overly optimistic.",positive,0.996

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in January that Tesla directors had not acted in shareholders’ interest in 2018 when the board approved $56 billion compensation for Musk. Tesla shareholders have now twice voted to award Musk the massive package, and the company is hoping the second vote will influence McCormck’s position on the case. Tesla valued Musk’s pay package at $44.9 billion in its  April proxy filing , owing to a 24% decline in Tesla’s stock price over the past year. Dive Insight:   A week after the shareholder vote, Tesla asked the Court of Chancery for an expedited briefing schedule to consider the vote’s impact, arguing that 72% of stockholders supported paying Musk the large compensation deal. “Defendants contend that the consequences of the Ratification alter the course of this litigation and any relief that is potentially available (and relatedly, any attorneys’ fees that may be awarded to Plaintiff’s Counsel), and thus cannot be ignored in an action that is supposed to advance the bests interests of the Company,” Tesla’s lawyers wrote. A group of Tesla shareholders, led by Richard Tornetta, a drummer for a Philadelphia-based heavy metal band,  sued in 2019 , saying that Tesla’s board was conflicted and effectively controlled by Musk when it came to designing the CEO’s compensation. Tesla’s second shareholder vote “is a transparent attempt to score a public relations victory, pressure the Court, and delay proceedings in this Action — perhaps so Defendants can deploy additional gambits that will needlessly complicate matters and consume further precious judicial resources,” the plaintiffs wrote Friday in a brief opposing Tesla’s request for an expedited hearing in light of the second vote. In May, Elson said Tesla had  threatened to end its relationship  with Holland & Knight, where Elson worked as a consultant, if he filed a brief to the court opposing Musk’s large payout. Tesla did not respond to a message seeking comment on the case. Tesla also sought, and received, shareholder permission to move its legal home from Delaware to Texas, where the company is based.",positive,0.901

While plans to expand the company’s German production site at Grünheide, near Berlin, are still being  contested by local environmental activists , Tesla mechanics in Sweden have been on strike for the last eight month. In Malmö, located in the country’s south, a large banner from the Swedish industrial workers’ union IF Metall hangs on the gates of a Tesla dealership. Across the street, two of the mechanics, wearing safety waistcoats in the IF Metall colours, are picketing against Tesla this May. If one of the mechanics complained, “the human resources manager told them that Tesla wasn’t for everyone and that they were free to leave”. Martin Berglund, mediator for IF Metall, refers to Tesla’s false familial character: “Tesla’s internal communication is based on the idea that all of its employees are family,” he explains. “But in reality, Tesla is creating a company within a company, where it circumvents rules and regulations on a daily basis”. IF Metall recently accused Tesla of illegally terminating an employment contract. So far, he is the only striker against Tesla whose contract has been ter-minated. Tesla’s refusal to comply with the Swedish system   In Malmö, seven mechanics have deserted the workbench since the start of the dispute. But for the moment, Tesla is showing no signs of budging. The conflict between Tesla and its employees lies in the American company’s categorical refusal to sign the agreement. From autumn 2022 to summer 2023, IF Metall attempted to negotiate with Tesla to draw up a collective agreement. Last November, Tesla CEO Elon Musk openly stated that he disagrees with the idea of unions: “I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company and create a sort of  lords and peasants situation” . They are not Tesla employees but instead work in sales, accounting and the hospital sector. In solidarity with the workshop mechanics, the dockers, lorry drivers and electricians responsible for maintaining car charging stations have started to boycott Tesla. “Tesla is now importing its vehicles by truck. In Vetlanda, unionised  Hydro  employees have refused to produce parts for Tesla”. At the beginning of May, Unionen, the union organisation for managers and office workers, lent its support to the strike at Tesla’s workshops. At Tesla’s only European plant in Grünheide, Germany, IF Metall’s German counterpart IG Metall entered the works council for the first time in the latest internal elections at the beginning of 2024. As he sees it, this strike differs from recent social movements in one significant way: Tesla is refusing all real negotiations and is calling in scabs. Here, Tesla is importing labour from its workshops in Europe”. “To be hired in the workshop now, all you have to do is show a great interest in Tesla,” they argue. Inside the garage, a banner hangs showing a hedgehog in a yellow waistcoat with the slogan “Tack, det är bra” (‘thanks, that’s fine’ in Swedish), Tesla’s way of letting them know that it’s doing just fine both without them and without conventions.

Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   The warnings seemed to suggest some issue with the 12V battery, which caused a whole cascade of issues. What happened is pretty clear, once you see it: for a Tesla Model Y’s doors to safely open, the window must drop down about an inch to clear the weatherstripping and molding on the body. In fact, Tesla had a sort-of fix for this, where they made sure that when the emergency door release was activated, the window would drop down, just like if the normal latch had been used. Even Tesla’s own Model Y owner’s manual says to use the emergency release in situations where there is no power, but no mention is made of the fact that it’s very likely the window will shatter if you use it:     I suppose if you open the door really slowly and carefully, you can maybe get by without cracking the window, but this is specifically for  emergencies,  when slowly and carefully just isn’t really on the menu. Tesla suggests that in the case of getting out of a Model Y with no power, you use the rear seat doors instead, which don’t need to drop their windows. So, that means Tesla wants you to climb over the seats into the back, then go through this simple procedure to open the doors:       See! Hopefully, this will all be fixed; I’ll try and report back on what the fixes are and how expensive, and, ideally, what Tesla service has to say about breaking windows to open doors.",negative,0.996
7 Reasons Behind Tesla's Insane Customer Retention Rate - CarBuzz,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1QanM5ZjZmYy0zYkQ2WFlNSVhCbktvOG1Ya2tLQ1Z3SVN5Q0o0OWg3WFFKTTZsemt0WXVmUy1ZVzBQZ0p3M09rMmNMOFl4cDJENXQxQ25vcnQ0bnY2Q3JYQTBTUlYydDhucE9IQ2l4aGhxbFh6?oc=5,"Sun, 16 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Having built itself a loyal (some say cult-like) fanbase over the past decade and a half, Tesla now has the highest retention rate in the automotive industry, estimated to be at a sky-high 87%. So what exactly is the secret behind Tesla’s high retention rate? Here are a few reasons why Tesla owners keep coming back for more. Tesla’s vehicles have contributed to mitigating range anxiety. In the company’s own words, “Tesla vehicles can travel some of the longest driving ranges of any other production electric vehicle on the market."" Some cars in the Tesla lineup are available with standard and long-range battery pack configurations. The other aspect of Tesla ownership that has helped ease consumers’ range anxiety is the Supercharger network, with its wide availability of fast, reliable chargers (more on that later). Tesla has worked to simplify this process with its Supercharger network, making it as quick, easy, and seamless as possible. In fact, the Supercharger model is so good that  EVs from other brands  will shortly be able to use it as well, opening up thousands of chargers to non-Tesla vehicles. Groundbreaking So-Called Self-Driving                   Aside from bringing electric cars into the mainstream, Tesla’s other claim to fame is the development and progress of driver assistance technology; the company’s goal is to eventually achieve full self-driving abilities. Constant Over-The-Air Updates                   Access to over-the-air updates means you can  keep your Tesla up to date  and with all the latest features in the comfort of your own home without having to upgrade components or replace your vehicle every year. Over-the-air updates are also used for more complex driving features such as autonomous capabilities, although Tesla has been  slightly more cautious  with that as of lately, making sure to emphasize the updates do not give your car fully autonomous capabilities due to complaints about the misleading nature of the “full self-driving” it had originally promised. Affordability: Electric Power For The People                   Tesla is often credited with bringing electric vehicles into the mainstream, and its prices reflect this. Electric motoring is now firmly within reach of the ordinary American family, with Tesla kickstarting the wave of affordable EVs hitting the market. These days, things are different, partly thanks to Tesla. If you are looking into buying a Tesla and have a spending limit of $50k, there are several options for joining the Tesla club on a budget. The Model 3 is the least expensive path into Tesla ownership, sitting just above the $40k mark at $38,990; the base Model Y isn’t far behind at $42,990. Related     Planning an all-Tesla drag race? Tesla is also responsible for bringing the possibility of owning a  1000 hp vehicle  to ordinary Americans, thanks to the Model S Plaid, the only car on the market with four-figure horsepower sitting under the $90k mark. It's Just Cool To Own A Tesla                   A big part of Tesla’s appeal, and part of what makes Tesla owners come back for more over and over again, is the company’s place in pop culture. Owner Elon Musk’s larger-than-life and frequently controversial figure has become inseparable from the brand itself; as a result, driving one of his cars has become synonymous with wealth, technological progress, and social clout. Bridging the gap between the world of cars and the world of tech with its sleek, futuristic aesthetic, Tesla has become the vehicle of choice for tech-bros, finance-bros, and anyone who simply wants to look cool. The same element of Tesla ownership that some people view as cult-like is seen as a selling point by others; driving a Tesla makes owners feel like they are a member of an exclusive club, somewhat removed from what Tesla fans refer to as “legacy automakers”. Thanks to the company’s Apple-esque approach to vehicle repair, as well as a separate charging network, owning a Tesla is less like owning a car and more like owning the latest status-symbol tech device.",negative,0.996

The exact amount depends on the Tesla share price. ""It only offers Tesla opportunities to try to use the vote to obtain a better decision going forward. “It will be interesting to see if another court is willing to credit a vote taken after the trial court’s decision.” The eye-popping sum had sparked criticism and raised concerns that the board of Tesla was too submissive and close to Mr Musk. Chancellor McCormick had pointed out that Antonio Gracias, who had been a board director at Tesla, had ""the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis"". She also highlighted Todd Maron, Tesla's former general counsel, ""who was Musk’s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition"". The fight over the plan had aired concerns about Mr Musk's leadership, at a time when Tesla's share price has fallen from its height and its position in the electric car industry is under pressure. The compensation plan gives Mr Musk rights to roughly 300 million shares - the equivalent to a 10% stake in the firm -   as a reward for Tesla meeting a number of goals set out in 2018 which are linked to sales, profits and the share price. Tesla had said that Mr Musk's goals were challenging. ""My understanding is that there's been about 1,100% appreciation in Tesla stock. On whether Mr Musk deserved such a large pay aware, Georg Ell, former director of Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme: ""If I was an investor who put a substantial amount of money into this in 2018 and had held it throughout the period, I’d be very happy because I would have seen anywhere between... Mr Ell disclosed that he has a small shareholding in Tesla, worth around £6,000. Tesla's board said Mr Musk deserved the package because the carmaker had achieved its targets under his leadership and that it was necessary to ensure he remains dedicated to the company. Mr Ell said that the result of the vote gives Mr Musk ""a very strong validation"" ""At Tesla of course he doesn’t do it all alone but he definitely sets the agenda, he sets the pace and he is a relentless person to work for, there’s no doubt about that,"" he said. Tesla executives expressed support for the package in social media posts, saying that Mr Musk was crucial to the company's success. Meanwhile, Mr Musk promised a personal tour of Tesla's factory in Texas to some shareholders who cast votes.",positive,0.997

This research update presents ARK’s open-source Tesla model, which incorporates distributions for 45 independent inputs to simulate a range of potential outcomes for the company and its stock. ARK’s Simulation Outputs  ARK’s 2029 Price Estimate (Per Share) Significance Expected Value $2,600 This projection is our expected value for Tesla’s stock price in 2029, based on our Monte Carlo analysis. Bear $2,000 In this analysis, the probability that Tesla’s stock could be worth $2,000 per share or less in 2029 is 25%. Bull $3,100 In this analysis, the probability that Tesla could be worth $3,100 per share or more in 2029 is 25%. ARK estimates that nearly 90% of Tesla’s enterprise value and earnings will be attributed to the robotaxi business in 2029, as shown below. Meanwhile, electric vehicles could approximate a quarter of total sales and ~10% of Tesla’s earnings potential, as we believe the robotaxi business will have much higher margins. This article presents 4 sections: Example Bear and Bull Outcomes Updates To ARK’s 2023 Tesla Model Business Opportunities Not Included In The Model Risks And Limits Of Our Model Example Bear and Bull Outcomes We do not provide a single bull or bear case, because we dimension their outcomes as the 75th and 25th percentile output from the simulation. In the bear case, Tesla doesn’t scale as aggressively and can remain at a higher price point for longer, which benefits its margin structure. In the bull case, the gross margins and EBITDA margins on Tesla’s electric vehicle business decline as it sells into lower priced car segments, offset by the ride-hailing business lines, which make up a larger percentage of profits. These forecasts do not reflect any fees or expenses related to owning Tesla shares. Updates To ARK’s 2023 Tesla Model Updates to ARK’s 2023 open-source Tesla model include: Updated Autonomous Driving Assumptions  Updated Tesla Manufacturing Growth Rate  2029 Model Considerations That Are Not Key Drivers Of Our Price Estimates Updated Autonomous Driving Assumptions We believe that Tesla will launch a robotaxi service within the next two years, and that the probability Tesla fails to launch a robotaxi service within five years is di minimis, as shown below. Note that in cases where robotaxis do not launch, Tesla could launch a human-driven ride-hail service for both strategic and tactical reasons, as we have analyzed  previously . 2 From a modeling perspective, we previously estimated that Tesla’s take rate would be ~40-60% on average, higher than Uber’s ~20-30% take rate. 3  This year, we fine-tuned our analysis to include the assumption that, initially, Tesla will own and operate its vehicle network, retaining all revenue per mile for the first one-to-three years. For later years, we assume that third-party companies will own and maintain the vehicle fleet, earning ~$0.20 per mile for their services, while the remainder of revenue per mile accrues to Tesla. In effect, Tesla’s take rate is ~80% on average in the final year of the model. While we pushed back our median launch date for Tesla’s robotaxi service by one year, we remain confident that the service will launch within the next five years. With the release of Full Self-Driving (FSD) v12, Tesla transitioned to a neural network that learns from video data and directly controls the vehicle, eliminating over 300,000 lines of manual code. 4  This update has enabled human-like—and in some instances zero-intervention driving 5 —by leveraging Tesla’s significant data advantage, which now exceeds 1.3 billion cumulative FSD miles. 6  According to our research, Tesla is accumulating data at ~110x the rate of Waymo, as shown below. Furthermore, our research suggests that a Tesla in FSD mode is ~5X safer than a human-driven Tesla, as shown below, and ~16X safer than the average car on the road, also shown below. No longer constrained by AI training compute, 7  Tesla's accelerated software updates are enhancing performance and safety. 8  As a result, Tesla should be able to demonstrate superior, statistically significant safety metrics and receive regulatory approval for its ro",negative,0.56

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas. The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. 17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained. He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. 17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive. 17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has",positive,0.998

District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled on Monday that Tesla owners could proceed with their case, attempting to prove that Tesla coerced them into paying exorbitant prices and enduring long waits for vehicle repairs under the threat of losing warranty coverage. Thompson cited evidence   suggesting Tesla’s control over the repairs market. Specifically, she pointed to Tesla’s alleged failure to open a sufficient number of authorized service centers and its design of vehicles that necessitate diagnostic and software updates exclusively available from Tesla. Furthermore, she highlighted evidence of a parts monopoly, including Tesla’s restrictions on original equipment manufacturers, limiting their sales to entities other than Tesla. Additionally, Tesla allegedly only sold parts to consumers on a limited basis. Read more:  EU Investigates Unfair Subsidies for Tesla, BMW and Renault   The judge also found potential evidence of illegal “tying” practices, wherein Tesla’s control over various markets allegedly forced customers into unwanted purchases. Tesla and its legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. They have previously argued that the lawsuit was based on an “illogical theory,” claiming that Tesla would not deliberately degrade its repairs and parts services as it would harm its more lucrative vehicle sales and leasing business. This lawsuit consolidates five separate complaints from vehicle owners who have paid for Tesla repairs and parts since March 2019. The plaintiffs allege that Tesla, headquartered in Austin, Texas, differs from its competitors by insisting on handling all servicing and parts needs internally, rather than allowing owners to use independent repair shops and third-party parts.",neutral,0.996

Shareholders voted with the board recommendations on nearly every proposal, including approving CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation package and reincorporating from Delaware to Texas. Tesla shares rallied the day of the vote, as Musk announced on X (formerly Twitter) that his 2018 compensation package would likely pass. We think the market was responding to the reduction of key person risk, since Musk may have potentially reevaluated his role at Tesla if the compensation package did not pass. While we think Musk’s departure would initially cause its stock to fall, we don’t believe Tesla needs him as much as it once did; thanks to its deep management roster, it should continue to meet its strategic priorities.

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas. The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. 17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained. He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. 17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive. 17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has",positive,0.998

The Tesla Cybertruck should be renamed the Tesla Powderkeg, and reviewing it is totally pointless. The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   I’m exhausted by the comments sections of my  Tesla Cybertruck review . The Cybertruck’s primary proponent, Elon Musk, is a ridiculous person who has offended numerous groups, including ones that have already been marginalized. You have one group that believes that you  must  actively and endlessly hate someone or you yourself are condoning all of the bad things they’ve ever done (one commenter even wrote “There are some people (myself included) that consider Musk a large enough problem that they will  judge a persons character when that persons uses or praises his work.”  For reference, Tesla sells half a million cars annually in the U.S.). While I think both groups — those who love Tesla and those who loathe it — have good intentions, oftentimes neither can think clearly. Maybe I Should Have Included In My Review Every Single Good And Bad Thing Elon Musk Has Ever Done   Lord knows I’m fallible. While I did point out that the truck cannot be disconnected from highly controversial CEO Elon Musk, some folks felt I should have criticized Musk more. – JT]   No one is objective, and not everyone writes from my perspective, but my perspective is that Elon Musk is a lot of things both good and bad, but he’s definitely a bit of an edgelord with some awful takes and even awful-er communication skills. I’m not saying “stick to sports,” as we write often about politics, and the larger world has to be considered when talking about Tesla — but how much throat-clearing is enough throat-clearing? It is, in a way, absurd to assume that anyone reading a review in The Autopian doesn’t already know about Elon Musk and hasn’t already formed an opinion about him. Think about how many Tesla Model Ys are sold each year (I’m using this example because loads of them are already out; you likely know somebody who owns one) — roughly a quarter million.

The air agency’s order gives Tesla a maximum of about 15 months to retain an engineering firm and devise a process to stop all toxic emissions from the paint shops except in emergencies when releases may be unavoidable.

The fight is in the form of a shareholder vote: Nearly all owners of Tesla stock, including Wall Street firms and thousands of individual investors, are casting ballots for or against the pay package, voting mostly online ahead of the automaker’s annual meeting Thursday in Austin, Texas. Tesla  has bought advertisements  and  launched a website  to try to sway investors to vote for the package — tactics that experts say are unheard of in a debate about a corporate executive’s pay. Musk is aiming to capitalize on his popularity among individual Tesla investors. Musk has all but  threatened to abandon Tesla  if he doesn’t get additional shares in the company. In January, he  posted on X  that he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla” if he didn’t have 25% voting control of the company. Musk was never paid the money: By the time the package was voided, he had stock options equivalent to 304 million Tesla shares but had not yet exercised the options to acquire them, according to the Delaware ruling. Tesla shareholders approved the pay package in 2018, with compensation tied to Tesla’s performance including its market value. She ruled in favor of a handful of Tesla shareholders who argued the pay was unfair in part because the board that approved it was  too close to Musk to be entirely independent  and shareholders were unaware of all the facts. “At least as to this transaction, Musk controlled Tesla,” McCormick  wrote in her ruling . The judge hasn’t ruled on that request, and Tesla’s board said in a proxy statement that a fee award may not be warranted if shareholders reapprove the compensation package.

Some of Musk’s supporters say that despite the Delaware ruling, they see the 2018 pay package as a promise that Tesla should follow through on as long as Musk holds up his end of the bargain by meeting the package’s performance goals. The performance requirements set in 2018 were based on three factors: Tesla’s market capitalization, revenue and profitability. In the  440-page proxy statement  explaining the vote, a committee of the Tesla board noted the “novel circumstances.” It recommended approval to “avoid further uncertainty regarding Mr. The requirements of the 2018 package were extraordinarily ambitious — and they were delivered,” the firm wrote in a letter to Tesla’s board, according to the proxy statement.

The class action lawsuit claims that Tesla violated the law by tying repairs and parts exclusively to Tesla purchases, thereby prohibiting vehicle owners from using third-party repair shops or seeking aftermarket parts. In March 2023,  two proposed class action lawsuits  were launched addressing the limited repair rights of Tesla owners. These cases alleged that Tesla caused ""owners to suffer lengthy delays in repairing or maintaining their EVs, only to pay supracompetitive prices for those parts and repairs once they are finally provided."" They were among a number of similar cases the court consolidated in June 2023. In  a ruling this week  [PDF], the judge found the plaintiffs had ""plausibly alleged a cause of action for monopolization"" relating to one claim – that Tesla's practices violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act for Unlawful Tying, where services are used as a tying product.",negative,0.993

David Swanson | Reuters Elon Musk  says he can grow  Tesla  into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from  Nvidia  to build up its infrastructure. On Tesla’s  first-quarter earnings  call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also  wrote  in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.” But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter. Tesla shares slipped as much as 1% on the news Tuesday morning. By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. “Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.” A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic  layoffs  and warned that head-count reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory. The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Critics have said Musk is  only a part-time CEO  of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S.,   according to the  Axios Harris Poll 100 survey , which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” Tesla’s stock price is down 29%   this year. Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla,  Musk has been  encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. “If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,”  Musk said  on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.” To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?” In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla. At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a  $500 million  “Dojo” supercomputer in  Buffalo, New York , and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in  Austin, Texas . The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly  introduced  the startup. Conflicts of interest While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a  post on X  in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Tesla’s latest  proxy filing  indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI. Musk’s comments in the January post rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.” Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent. For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk  enlisted  dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup. A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s  2016 acquisition of SolarCity , where he w",neutral,0.994

According to a document  filed  with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Tesla said in March that it began to look into reports from drivers in China about what it called ""unintended hood opening events.""  Subsequent company investigations revealed the presence of deformed hood latch switches, an issue that it said ""could prevent the customer from being notified of an open hood state."" Further studies led the company to issue a voluntary recall of affected vehicles ""out of an abundance of caution."" No injuries or deaths have been reported as a result of the issue, Tesla said, and only 1% of vehicles are likely to suffer from the defect. But, it acknowledged that “unknowingly driving a vehicle with an unlatched hood may result in the hood fully opening and obstructing the driver’s view, increasing the risk of a collision."" The recalled vehicles include:  Tesla Model 3 vehicles produced since 2017 and equipped with a hood latch manufactured in China. All Tesla Model S vehicles manufactured since 2013. To remedy the issue, Tesla has released an over-the-air software update, as it customarily does in instances of recalls. The recall is Tesla's ninth of the year, and the fourth since 2022 to affect more than 1 million vehicles. The company remains under federal investigation in the wake of a  NHTSA report  that found Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 of which resulted in fatalities and “many others” yielding serious injuries.",neutral,0.995

Factors Contributing to the Earnings Miss   Several key factors contributed to Tesla’s recent earnings miss. Tesla has been aggressively cutting prices and offering incentives to boost sales, which has significantly impacted its profitability. Additionally, Tesla’s operating expenses soared by 39% due to substantial investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure, including the development of its Dojo supercomputer and AI processors. These investments aim at advancing Tesla’s autonomous driving and robotics capabilities but have added considerable financial strain. Furthermore, automotive revenue fell by 7% from the previous year, exacerbated by increased competition, particularly in China, and a decline in deliveries of Tesla’s most popular electric vehicles. Impact on Tesla’s Stock and Market Reaction   The earnings miss had an immediate and significant impact on Tesla’s stock. Tesla’s stock had been relatively stable for the year, down less than 1% before the earnings report, while the Nasdaq had risen by 20% over the same period. The disappointing earnings have led to a cautious outlook among investors, with some analysts recommending selling Tesla shares. This market reaction underscores the challenges Tesla faces in balancing growth and profitability. Future Outlook and Investor Sentiment   Looking ahead, Tesla’s future outlook is a mix of cautious optimism and significant uncertainty. CEO Elon Musk has reiterated that Tesla’s long-term value lies in its autonomy capabilities, suggesting that those who doubt this vision should reconsider holding Tesla stock. Tesla’s heavy investments in AI infrastructure and the development of new technologies like the Dojo supercomputer are costly and have yet to yield immediate financial returns.

Tesla’s Profit Sees a 5-Year Low But Carbon Credit Sales Hit Record High - CarbonCredits.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOdzBRSExHc01GVzBvNTlORFhqZUR6TEdRUS1YWmdMOW1ORGxGeFE0Mk93YUxyMUt2WWxJdjI0Z2tvSGtNLU83dVN1WEpZRVBfOEd1amlycGpnRDBCNGdQdjFmWVNiQmZQX1RVNFg4aWQxUGg4WnAzcVFZLXFKZjVYQm1wWWxub3VsMjM1cm04VTNIWHExQzVDUXJtYzYxY0RhVmpjeHB4U3g0Qkh2VW1n?oc=5,"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla reported its lowest profit margin in over five years and missed Wall Street earnings targets in Q2, as the company cut prices to boost demand while increasing spending on AI projects. However, Tesla’s carbon credit (regulatory credits) revenue is at an all-time high, hitting $890 million. Tesla Profit Struggles Amid Carbon Credit Sales Surge     Tesla  reported a 45% drop in profit for Q2, earning $1.5 billion on $25.5 billion in revenue, compared to $2.7 billion on $24.9 billion in the same period last year. This decline in profit increases pressure on CEO Elon Musk to find new growth avenues. Despite this,  Tesla shares  have surged 40% since May, driven by investor optimism that Musk will transform Tesla into an AI company offering driverless taxis and robots. Tesla’s Q2 electric car sales fell 4.8% to 444,000 vehicles, with production down 14% to about 411,000 cars. Tesla faces increasing competition as other manufacturers ramp up electric vehicle production. For the first time, Tesla’s share of U.S. Competition Hits Tesla Hard: Carbon Credits to the Rescue   Most notably, the $890 million carbon credit revenue is almost  60%  of Tesla’s Q2 net income of $1,494 million. For an EV-only company like Tesla, which has no combustion business to offset, the constant flow of these credits has been a financial “gusher,” comparable to a highly profitable oil strike in the fossil fuel industry. Tesla continues to  profit from selling carbon credits  to competitors who need to comply with emissions standards. This business model is highly lucrative for Tesla, as earning these credits incurs minimal costs, translating to pure profit. This revenue stream has been crucial for Tesla’s financial success. Chart from Reuters   Elon Musk acknowledged that the influx of more affordable electric cars from other manufacturers “has made it more difficult for Tesla” to sell vehicles. From April through June, Tesla’s share of U.S. Investment analyst Dan Coatsworth noted that Tesla has missed earnings targets for four consecutive quarters. Another Growing Business For Tesla   CEO Elon Musk highlighted that new competitors have significantly discounted their EVs, challenging Tesla. Despite these challenges, Tesla expects a production increase in Q3. In Q2 2024, Tesla Energy deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products, including Megapacks, Powerwalls, and solar products. Tesla’s Q2 financials reflect a significant drop in profit and production amid intensified competition and rising operating costs. As Tesla navigates these challenges, its investments in AI and energy storage hint at new growth avenues beyond electric vehicles.",positive,0.996

Tesla  and Intersect Power have signed a contract for 15.3 GWh of Megapacks, Tesla’s advanced battery storage system, for the latter’s  solar and storage projects  through 2030. Tesla’s Megapack is a large-scale lithium-based  battery energy storage system  aimed at improving grid stability and preventing outages. Tesla’s Battery Energy Storage Crazy Growth   Despite a  decline in automotive revenues , Tesla has seen growth in other business segments, particularly in energy storage, which is becoming increasingly profitable. With the rising number of Megapack installations and an expanding fleet, Tesla expects consistent profit growth in this segment. In Q1 2024, Tesla’s energy storage deployments hit a record high of 4.1 GWh. In Q2 2024, Tesla Energy deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products, including Megapacks, Powerwalls, and solar products. Tesla has previously supplied 2.4 GWh of Megapacks for Intersect Power’s solar and storage facilities, which are either operational or under construction. Mike Snyder, Senior Director of Tesla Energy, stated,    “Intersect continues to be an exceptional partner, and their development expertise combined with the plug-and-play nature of Tesla’s vertically integrated technology enables the speed and scale needed to enhance grid resilience and support greater renewables integration.”   Amplifying Intersect Power’s Leadership in Clean Energy Storage   Intersect Power is a clean energy company focused on innovative, scalable low-carbon solutions. The Megapacks are set for delivery in 2025 and 2026 and will be produced at Tesla’s Megafactory in Lathrop, California. Currently, Intersect Power has 2.4 GWh of Tesla Megapacks either operational or under construction. Tesla Energy’s Power Gain Major Boost with Megapacks   Tesla Energy has also signed a $375 million contract to provide Megapacks for a major battery project in Australia. Tesla Megapacks have been making notable strides in Australia’s energy market. In October 2023, a 150 MW/300 MWh Tesla Megapack system was commissioned in New South Wales. Additionally, in April 2024, Tesla Energy was awarded a contract by Neoen to expand the Collie Battery, aiming to transform it into the largest battery in Australia, with a final capacity of 560 MW/2,240 MWh. This Megapack agreement, alongside Tesla and Intersect Power’s significant deal underscore the growing demand for advanced energy storage solutions.",neutral,0.995

Fuqua had a firsthand glimpse of the prototype at the Tesla shareholders conference in Austin, Texas, last year, and thought the truck was unbelievable in person, which change his initial thoughts when the vehicle was revealed in 2019. “Being a Tesla owner for nearly 10 years, you have to be an early adopter,” Fuqua said from his office. But definitely for the early adopters, you had to be a real tech geek and not mind being almost a beta tester.” His commitment to the brand led him to unique experiences, like escorting Motown legend Smokey Robinson in a Tesla Model S to a Ruby Diamond Concert Hall concert in 2017, fulfilling a clause in the artist's concert rider contract. A look inside Some may believe Tesla has done away with the gas, since the U.S. According to Tesla, the truck has great durability. CEO Elon Musk created this vision, inspired by a question one of his children asked, ""Dad, why doesn't the future look like the future?"" “You said this to the richest, most innovative man-child on the planet,"" Fuqua said. With its 11,000-pound towing capacity and 6' x 4' trunk bed dimensions, Tesla claims the Cybertruck is big enough to haul construction materials. Even though it doesn't take hours to charge a Cybertruck, nobody wants to be bored at one of the many Tesla Supercharger stations. Tesla owners can sit in their vehicles and engage with the fully functional theater, arcade and Toybox, where they can activate 'Musk's must' with the fart sound it exudes. Next for Tesla in Tallahassee Now, in Tallahassee there are six Supercharger stations. More recently, a sign for the new Tesla Service Center on West Tennessee Street went up, marking the establishment of the brand's presence in the capital city.

Tesla Energy deployed 4.1  GWh  of energy storage in Q1 2024, bringing its total storage deliveries to 13.5  GWh  in the first half of 2024. “Our non-automotive business is becoming an increasingly profitable part of Tesla,” the company said in its  Q1 2024 earnings report . Tesla Energy’s storage deployments jumped 157% year-over-year and 132% quarter-over-quarter. The Q2 2024 figures suggest Tesla Energy’s Lathrop, California, Megapack factory is nearing full production capacity,  Tesla commentator Sawyer Merritt  tweeted July 2. “We have our second [assembly] line allowing us to increase our exit rate from 20 GWh per year … at the start of this year to 40 GWh per year by the end of the year,” Tesla Senior Director of Megapack Mike Snyder said during the company’s Q1 update. Larger Tesla Megapack customers typically order batteries 12 to 24 months in advance of delivery, allowing Tesla to plan production several quarters in advance, Snyder said. Tesla expects to begin production in Q1 2025 at a second 40-GWh Megapack factory it’s building in Shanghai, China, Tesla Senior Vice President of Automotive Tom Zhu  told Teslarati  in May. Megapack is designed for utilities and large commercial users, with each unit capable of storing 3.9 MWh,  Tesla says . Tesla will release detailed second-quarter financial results on July 23, the company said July 2. In Q1 2024, Tesla Energy booked a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 140% year-over-year jump in gross profit thanks to higher Megapack deployments, “partially offset by a decrease in solar deployments,” the company said in its Q1 update. Tesla expects its energy storage deployment and revenue growth rates to outpace those of its automotive business in 2024, the company said last quarter. “Our non-automotive business is becoming an increasingly profitable part of Tesla,” Tesla said. “As Megapack continues to ramp and as our fleet continues to grow, we are expecting consistent profit growth of our non-automotive business.”   Still, energy storage and generation is a small part of Tesla’s overall business.",neutral,0.994

And one area of outsized growth for Tesla beyond its car business could be energy. In its  second quarter production and delivery report , Tesla said that it deployed 9.4 GWh (gigawatt hours) of battery energy storage, its highest quarterly amount ever, and more than double the amount of battery storage the company deployed in the first quarter. A Tesla Megapack energy storage unit. (Tesla.com)   ·   Tesla   Tesla’s energy storage business, part of  Tesla Energy , includes installations as small as  Powerwall batteries  for the home to massive  Megapack storage facilities  meant for utilities and municipalities to store large amounts of energy for deployment at peak energy usage times. While a Powerwall typically holds around 12.2 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, or enough to power a small home for a day, one Megapack installation can hold 3.9 megawatt-hours of energy, enough to power 3,600 homes for one hour, Tesla said. Though Tesla only booked $1.6 billion in revenue from its energy storage business in the first quarter, the company reported a healthy $403 million in gross profit from the business, good for a gross margin of 24.6%. Tesla’s overall gross profit was $3.7 billion in Q1, with a gross margin of 17.4%, which was down from 19.3% a year ago. The drop in gross margin was due to Tesla’s EV price cuts, which were meant to spur demand and have been eating into profits over the past year. Here's why energy could be another catalyst for Tesla stock. Tesla’s auto business, which represents the lion’s share of the company’s revenue and profits, is now actually weighing on Tesla’s overall gross margin, notwithstanding the positive effects of the growing profits and operational efficiency of its energy storage business. But with Tesla doubling storage deployments in Q2 versus Q1, the effect on the company's bottom line could be substantial — and Wall Street is of course noticing the growth, and profit appeal, of Tesla’s energy storage business. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas dubbed Tesla’s Q2 energy deployment storage figure a “show stealer,” noting the 9.4 GWh deployed was double the firm’s forecast. “We believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the US electric grid accelerated by the AI boom,” Jonas wrote in a note to clients last week. Morgan Stanley has a $310 price target on Tesla. Jonas believes generative AI spending and resulting buildouts will spur a “multigenerational increase in energy demand,” electricity generation, and data center investment, and Tesla’s energy storage business is poised to benefit.",neutral,0.996

The bad news, if you think of Tesla as a car company, is that CEO Elon Musk is sticking to his line that it isn’t. Elsewhere in the Tesla-verse is a judge’s ruling in the company’s favor that it can pursue a trial against Rivian for allegedly encouraging its ex-Tesla employees to steal trade secrets. The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   Alphabet, aka Google’s parents, aren’t so bothered by GM’s robotaxi shift and are doubling down with a $5 billion investment in its robotaxi arm Waymo. Tesla Margins Drop To 14.6%   VIDEO   If you want to lose money, bet against Elon Musk. My question yesterday about Tesla was more about revenue than margins. Specifically, I was curious how much the company’s push to move cars at a discount would hit Tesla’s historically high margins. Tesla’s margins, after you take out regulatory credits the company gets from other OEMs, dropped to 14.6%, versus  analyst estimates of 16.29% . Tesla doesn’t work that way, and its margins were a big part of its perceived value. Tesla’s stock is down almost 12% this morning. Even though the company made a little more in total revenue (up about 2%),  where  it made those revenues is important:         I’m turning a bit into a broken record here, but Elon Musk  does not think of Tesla as a car company . Although the numbers sound crazy, I think, Tesla is producing at volume with and supervised MSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate a giant autonomous fleet. That’s not a lot about cars, though Musk did basically confirm that the affordable Tesla is coming in the first half of 2025 and, rather than some mostly gigacast car, it’ll be a more traditional Tesla model that can be built on existing production lines:   We won’t get too much into the product road map here because that is reserved for product announcement events. I would suggest listening to this section (which  you can do here ) and you’ll notice he barely finishes his thought about the car before jumping into:   The big — really, by far, the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy. If autonomy is so important to Tesla how long do we have to wait to see a fully self-driving robotaxi? Tesla Can Go Ahead With Rivian Lawsuit     Did Rivian encourage Tesla defectors to steal Tesla’s company secrets in order to improve Rivian’s products? That’s the question at the heart of a lawsuit from Tesla against its rival EV automaker. Zayner of the Santa Clara County Superior Court tentatively denied Rivian’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, stating Tesla presented sufficient evidence for a trial. “Tesla’s evidence establishes that some Rivian employees were less thoroughly investigated and not disciplined,” the judge wrote in the tentative order.",neutral,0.993

Tesla shares  plummeted  more than 25% at the outset of 2024 but the company had recovered all of those losses this month after it released a better-than-expected report on vehicle deliveries. Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, said the boost in revenue from government credits afforded the company a financial lifeline even as it struggled in its main line of business: selling vehicles. As competitors roll out alternatives, Tesla faces a difficult path to regain its previous breakneck growth, analysts previously told ABC News. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on Mar. Christian Marquardt/Pool via Getty Images Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, who is bullish on Tesla, downplayed the weaker-than-expected earnings report and highlighted potential gains from the company’s development of autonomous vehicles. “We were not looking for major fireworks this quarter from Tesla,” Ives said on Wednesday in a note to investors. “The next phase of the Tesla growth story is around autonomous, Robotaxis, and AI playing out for Musk & Co. In December, Tesla  recalled  about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system. “Tesla doesn’t have one Robotaxi on the road,” Johnson said.",neutral,0.995

As of mid-June, Tesla was producing  1,300 Cybertrucks  per week, with a goal of reaching  2,500 weekly vehicles  by the end of 2024. Will the Cybertruck become Tesla's next big hit, as pervasive as the Model 3, or will it be a miss for the EV company? Here are a few things to consider when evaluating the potential impact of the Cybertruck on Tesla’s financial future. 21, 2019 file photo, Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, Calif. Tesla’s share of US EV sales  fell below 50%  for the first time ever in the second quarter. While Tesla hasn’t revealed how much it costs to build the Cybertruck, the vehicle was first built at the company’s new Texas Gigafactory, which Musk said was a $10 billion investment. Tesla’s goal is to get the price tag near $50,000, but these manufacturing costs could make that difficult to achieve. Despite mixed reviews, loyal Tesla fans may continue to support Musk’s product visions — and Tesla's stock price. Tesla’s short sellers have  lost over $60 billion  since the company went public, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners. Ultimately, company fundamentals, such as sales numbers for the Cybertruck, are not always what drives Tesla's stock performance. “Really, it’s what the market is doing rather than exactly what Tesla is doing,” Dusaniwsky said.",neutral,0.996

VIDEO     New York State officials are prepared to slash penalties on Tesla in coming years, even if the company fails to hire enough workers at its South Buffalo plant and across the state. Under the company’s current arrangement with the state, Tesla must employ 1,460 workers in Buffalo and 2,000 statewide or else pay a $41 million fine. According to details of a draft agreement, which could run through 2034, Tesla must employ 1,800 in Buffalo and 3,000 statewide. Before CEO Elon Musk announced company-wide layoffs in April, state officials were prepared to cut the fines sooner and more steeply. Tesla and state officials agreed to fines no higher than $3,333 for every job Tesla fell short on hiring, according to a letter of intent signed in January that outlined terms of the new deal. Other terms of the new deal — details of which Empire State Development released in response to a Freedom of Information Law request — include:     Tesla will locate its “Dojo Supercomputer” at the Buffalo factory, a $500 million project Gov. Tesla will pay rent — $2 million annually through 2029 and $5 million annually through 2034. Tesla will hire 500 more employees if state lawmakers allow it to open 10 direct-to-consumer car dealerships across the state. The agreement, which is not believed to have been signed, would also see both Tesla and Empire State Development invest more in job training programs in Buffalo. Letter of intent, correspondence between New York and Tesla. Despite Tesla’s increased investments and job commitments, critics of the state’s original deal with Tesla said the new lease doesn’t go far enough to hold the company accountable to taxpayers who paid for the $959 million factory the electric vehicle manufacturer occupies. Sean Ryan, chair of the Senate’s economic development committee, who noted neither the original agreement nor the draft agreement required higher wages for Tesla employees. In response to questions about whether or not Tesla had agreed to have higher fines reinserted into the deal and if the agreement had been finalized, Empire State Development spokesperson Matthew Gorton suggested Investigative Post contact Tesla. A Tesla representative did not respond to a request for comment. Details of draft deal   Tesla’s current lease with New York — which it took over from SolarCity and the solar panel parts maker Silevo — went into effect in September 2014 and was slated to last for a decade. Tesla and Empire State Development signed a letter of intent outlining terms of a new lease and broader agreement Jan. A week later, Hochul announced that Tesla would spend $500 million and locate its supercomputer in Buffalo. The correspondence showed that Tesla’s April layoffs alarmed Empire State Development and caused the agency to reopen negotiations with the electric vehicle manufacturer. Empire State Development President and CEO Hope Knight penned a letter to Tesla May 13 demanding to know how many workers the company was laying off and what its plans were for the Buffalo factory. Tesla responded two weeks later assuring Empire State Development that it was committed to New York and meeting its job goals. Prior to the layoffs, Tesla employed 1,804 in South Buffalo and 2,707 statewide. Empire State Development, records show, worried that Tesla wouldn’t be able to meet the terms of the agreement. Tesla, for example, is still on the hook to invest a total of $5 billion in New York, not including its $500 million supercomputer project. In the event Tesla doesn’t invest $500 million in its supercomputer — discussed as part of larger regional effort to make advancements in the artificial intelligence sector — Empire State Development will double its rent until it meets that level of spending. Tesla’s rent payments, however, will largely go towards maintenance and improvements at the factory, benefitting the company. Tesla will separately pay $250,000 annually to job training programs. Investigative Post revealed in November the existence of a $29 million pot of money  that Tesla has already tapped  for factory projects. It further stipulates that New York will ensure Tesla can win all regulatory approvals for its supercomputer. “Tesla’s commitment to locate supercomputing capabilities at the Gigafactory New York manufacturing facility is premised upon ESD ensuring rapid and efficient permitting and a State commitment not to unreasonably withhold or delay all approvals, consents, permits, modifications or waivers,” the letter of intent reads. The agreement also includes language that Tesla will hire 250 more workers in New York should lawmakers grant approval for the company to open up five direct-to-consumer dealerships, and another 250 jobs for an additional five dealerships. The car dealership question   Tesla’s ask to open up more car dealerships is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the draft agreement. Prior to 2014, Tesla opened a total of  five showrooms  in New York despite a state law that restricts direct-to-consumer sales by auto manufacturers. In 2014, under a threat by the state legislature to ban Tesla from direct-to-consumer sales, the Cuomo administration brokered a deal allowing the company to keep its five existing dealerships open. When Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016, its consultants contemplated whether it should move into the Buffalo factory at all — or simply pay a fee to New York and walk away. The company chose to move into the existing factory, records show, in part because Tesla wanted to curry favor with state leaders so it could expand in the future. If Tesla wants to open more locations, state law would have to change. He added: “I think Tesla should focus on keeping their employment where it should be and not worry about adding more locations. They’re getting a very generous tax break to be here, very generous, that most companies don’t achieve and now they want to take advantage of that further.”   Ken Girardin, research director at the Empire Center think tank, also questioned Empire State Development agreeing in principle to allow more Tesla sales locations. He, too, noted that there would be “lots of variables” at play to get the state legislature to approve more locations for Tesla.",positive,0.997

However, while most of Tesla recalls are for issues that can be fixed with software updates, this new one is notable as it requires a visit to the service center. According to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report (via  Reuters ), Tesla has issued a recall for 9,136 Model X SUVs over a trim on the roof that could separate and increase the risk of a crash. Owners of affected Teslas, which are all of the 2016 model year Model X vehicles, will have to go to a Tesla service center where the roof trim adhesion will be tested and trim pieces reattached to make sure the cars are safe to drive, at no cost to the owners. The first time it happened was in 2020, but now Tesla says that fix was not sufficient to truly remedy the issue. Tesla said it wasn't aware of any crashes or injuries related to the issue.",positive,0.963

In 2021 , the City Council  voted 3-2 to implement the Tesla patrol car pilot program  as part of the city’s effort to be carbon neutral by 2030. Because Tesla does not manufacture any purpose-built police vehicles, the police department had to outfit and modify the vehicles to be used as patrol vehicles. The base price of the Tesla Model Y was $64,270 and upgrades and outfitting cost the city $38,482 per car, which made for a total cost of $102,752 per car. Officer safety concerns One of Menlo Park’s Tesla Model Y patrol vehicles. According to the staff report, a majority of the challenges that police staff faced were due to the outfitting of the Tesla, and the “smart” features of the car. Officers relayed in the staff report that “on occasion, the Teslas automatically stop when an officer attempts to pull off to the side of the road to approach vehicles or people.”  Officers also said that they experienced issues with lighting controls, as Tesla does not allow direct access to the lighting system, and they were required to go through a “multi-step touchscreen process” just to dim their lights. City staff looked into modifying some aspects of these smart features to make the vehicles more appropriate for patrol use, but “the outfitter relayed that they attempted to reach out to Tesla but were not able to access or modify the central operating system,” according to the staff report. Police department staff provided a list of recommendations that Tesla could address to support patrol use of Tesla vehicles, including a “public safety mode” that disables some autopilot steering corrections, a customizable sleep mode that would keep car lights on and unlimited digital keys for police accounts. The Tesla pilot program was implemented as part of the city’s climate action plan, which aims for the city to be carbon neutral by 2030. According to the staff report, the Menlo Park Police Department will continue to use the Tesla vehicles that they have already purchased.",neutral,0.988

Although it's still in its development phase, the early numbers that make up the new Tesla Roadster are jaw-dropping, including its 0-60 time. 1.9: Elite Acceleration Off The Mark                                       Tesla          With your foot on the accelerator, the Roadster is expected to go from 0 to 60 mph in an astonishing  1.9  seconds. It's also a giant step up from the  first-generation Tesla Roadster . 4.2: Quicker To 100 Than Most Cars Are To 60                                       Tesla          Most EVs can get off the mark very quickly, but the Tesla Roadster continues accelerating with force at higher speeds. In fact, it's  quicker than many cars  take to reach 60 mph, thanks to the immense power generated by the Tesla's motors. Tesla Roadster Vs. Rimac Nevera               Model       Tesla Roadster       Rimac Nevera           0-60 mph       1.9 seconds       1.74 seconds           Top Speed       Over 250 mph       258 mph           Torque       7,375 lb-ft (wheel torque)       1,740 lb-ft           Range       620 miles       304 miles (WLTP cycle)           Cost       $200,000 (estimated)       ~ $2.2 million                                      8.8: Slaying The Quarter-Mile                                       Tesla          A  sub-9-second quarter-mile time  puts the Roadster in a league of its own, with the claimed figure being  8.8  seconds. The Tesla Roadster's 0 to 60 and quarter-mile times demonstrate its ability to not just compete but dominate in the world of high-performance vehicles. Tesla Roadster In Action                                  Tesla          There's no sugarcoating it: the  $50,000  reservation fee for the Roadster is almost unheard of in the automotive world, and it speaks volumes about the high demand and exclusivity surrounding this car. Still, the $50,000 reservation price adds to the allure of what  Tesla is promising  to its prospective drivers. 620: Unmatched Range On A Full Charge                                       Tesla          It's generally accepted that there's going to be a range penalty to pay in an EV as the level of performance increases. Based on the claims, the Tesla Roadster can cover an extraordinary  620  miles on a full charge, despite its unmatched performance. 10,000 Nm: Unbridled Torque                                       Tesla          There were gasps when the Tesla Roadster was revealed with  10,000  Nm (7,375 lb-ft) of torque. It's still a towering number, though, and helps the Tesla deliver its shattering acceleration. 4: Pace And Practicality                                       Tesla          Unlike many other supercars that focus solely on the driver, the Roadster seats  four . 250: Hit New Speeds                                       Tesla          Oh, and in case you think this car didn't already do enough, its top speed of over  250  mph puts the Roadster in  hypercar territory . 250,000: Sky-High Founders Series Price                                       Tesla Roadster          The reservation price should tell you that the Roaster isn't going to be cheap.

The policy previously included a potential $50,000 penalty and restrictions on ordering new Tesla models. The Tesla Cybertruck is a hot commodity, with fans of the polarizing truck clamoring over each other to get their hands on the electric pickup. To prevent this, Tesla introduced a clause that prevented customers from selling their Foundation Series variants within a year of taking delivery. While the previous policy may not seem fair - after all, people should be able to do what they want with their vehicles - Tesla implemented the rule to protect other customers and the resale value of its high-demand vehicles. Aside from the hefty financial penalties, Tesla has even banned customers from ordering additional vehicles, as a punishment of sorts. The automaker also noted that it had the right to cancel any order it believed had ""been made with a view toward resale of the vehicle or that has otherwise been made in bad faith."" What's more, Tesla would keep the order deposit and fee, along with the transportation fee. ""Tesla may seek injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the vehicle or demand liquidated damages from you in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater. Tesla may also refuse to sell you any future vehicles.""       - An excerpt from Tesla's former Cybertruck resale clause. It's possible that Tesla no longer has a need for a no-resale policy. It's one of the best-selling electric trucks on the market, besting even the  Ford F-150 Lighting  in recent months, but it must be said that those figures are a far cry from the 2 million pre-orders the Cybertruck had when company CEO Elon Musk said it would cost around $40,000. Related     Tesla's cheapest Cybertruck variant has disappeared. Tesla is also increasing production of the Cybertruck, hopefully allowing the automaker to finally meet demand and fill outstanding orders, but if cheaper versions don't return soon,  Ford may gain the edge in a couple of years .

The company has made made good on that promise, and now Tesla car buyers can save up to $2,500 on a new Tesla car purchase when they use a referral code or referral link. The referrer gets a $500 credit toward merchandise in the Tesla shop, a new car purchase or even service or maintenance performed at a Tesla service center and the buyer gets an instant discount off a special order or inventory Model 3, Y, S, X or CyberTruck. UPDATE (February 1, 2025)  – Tesla has increased the referral or loyalty discount on Model 3 from $500 to to $2500. Use one of the below referral links (or one from a friend of family member) to save $1,000 off the purchase price of a Tesla Model S, Model X or CyberTruck, $500 of a Tesla Model Y (excluding Launch Series) or $2500 off any Model 3. If you need a referral code for the discount, feel free to use any of our referral links (some may have already reached the referral cap, so just try the next one down until you see the discount appear on screen after clicking the link):     Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Christopher55570)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Steve81051)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Kevin51692)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (John49040)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Brian33170)     As the company did previously, Tesla has included a cap on the number of referrals a Tesla owner can make in the new program. And while a referrer can refer up to 10 buyers per year (and the buyer and referrer will get the credit), the company is capping the number of “loyalty rewards” (where you use your own referral code to buy a new Tesla) to 10 referrals “per lifetime.” Tesla has been known to modify the terms and conditions of its referral program without warning or notification, so it’s best to check the “ Terms and Conditions ” page on the Tesla web site for details. As a regular referrer myself, I will say it’s nice to see that the referral rewards can be applied toward actually useful things like a new car purchase, Tesla merch or even service and maintenance expenses. According to Tesla, Referral Rewards do currently expire 1 year after they are earned, though there is currently no expiration date visible in the “Tesla wallet.”   Is the Tesla CyberTruck, Roadster or Tesla Solar Eligible for the Referral Discount? As of November, 2024, Tesla has added CyberTruck to the list of eligible vehicles and is currently offering a $1,000 discount on Cybertruck purchase with a referral code or referral link. The current referral reward applies toward the purchase of a Tesla Model S ($1,000 discount), Model 3 ($2,500 discount), Model X ($1,000 discount), Model Y ($500 discount) or CyberTruck ($1,000 discount). The Tesla Roadster 2.0 is not currently eligible for rewards. But Tesla did add Solar Panels and Powerwall back into the referral program in late 2024. Who Can Get a Tesla Referral Code or Referral Link? Any person who owns a Tesla car and lives in a region that is eligible to earn referral rewards can refer a new customer to Tesla and get the referral reward. If you are buying a Tesla car and have a friend or family member who owns a Tesla, ask them for their referral code or referral link so you can both earn the reward bonus. Tesla customers can find their referral link in the Tesla mobile app in the “Refer and Earn” link in your the account section (the three lines on the top right of the app screen). Existing Tesla customers can find details on the Tesla referral program in the “Refere and Earn” section of the Tesla mobile app. As of February 1, 2025, the Tesla customer who successfully refers a new person to buy a Tesla Cybertruck, Model S, Model 3, Model X or Model Y earns $500 toward Supercharging, software upgrades, merchandise, service payments or the purchase of a new Tesla for each person they refer who takes delivery. A referral for Tesla solar earns the referrer a $250 credit in Tecla Bucks. The referral will show up as “Ordered” in the Tesla app until the buyer takes delivery of his or her car. Upon delivery, then the status changes to “delivered” and the credit appears in the referrer’s Tesla Wallter. The first 10 people who order a new Tesla car using the referral link (per year) will receive an instant discount off the purchase price of a Model S, X or Cybertruck, Model 3 or Model Y (not including Model Y Launch Edition). Tesla’s referral program is currently capped at 10 referral rewards per referrer per year. The Bottom Line   Tesla has never been big on marketing or advertising, but they have been effective at driving new customers by tapping into the loyalty and enthusiasm of current Tesla owners with the Tesla referral program. Despite the CEO’s online antics,  Tesla still leads the automotive sector for brand loyalty , with 87% of Tesla owners saying they plan to buy another Tesla. By offering useful rewards like a discount on the purchase price of any Tesla car and even service credits and free Supercharging for current customers, Tesla should be able to stimulate sales with this revised program. >  Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,000 on a new Tesla Cybertruck, Model S, 3, X or Y (note: if this link is maxed out, see additional referral links above)   Related Reading:   Tesla Referral Program FAQ (updated)   Tesla Leads Automotive Sector with Highest Brand Loyalty  (2024 Study)       Whether you have solar power or not, please complete  our latest solar power survey .",positive,0.997

And throughout  Tesla's history , the automaker managed to put electric vehicles on the map and become the most valuable car company on the planet. Working at Tesla   Tesla CEO Elon Musk  has led the company to outperform traditional automakers over the last few years. Tesla has been through periods of rapid growth — and numerous rounds of  Tesla layoffs , with the most recent in 2024 seeing over  10% of Tesla's workforce laid off . Musk has also been very critical of work-from-home and starting in the summer of 2022, all but killed the  Tesla WFH  policy, telling executive staff that they needed to return to the office or resign. Musk officially moved  Tesla headquarters  from California to Austin, Texas in December 2021. Tesla has six gigafactories in the US, Europe, and Asia, where it builds batteries and electric vehicles. Musk spoke at Tesla's 2022 annual meeting about wanting to 10 to 12 more in the next several years. Expanding the  Tesla gigafactory  network would boost the company's manufacturing capabilities. TSLA Stock   Tesla's stock price was essentially flat for several years after its 2010 IPO. At that point, Tesla's share price took off. If you bought  Tesla stock  right after the IPO and held on, you'd be looking at a 1,000%-plus return. Tesla revenue  was $96.8 billion in 2023, with $78.5 billion of that coming from sales of its EVs. The company also makes money from its energy business and through selling regulatory credits to other automakers — a side hustle that earned Tesla nearly $1.8 billion in 2023. The latest  Tesla earnings  call in July 2024 revealed overall revenue rose 2% to $25.5 billion, but operating profit fell 33% to $1.61 billion, $200 million below estimates. Along with the rest of the auto industry, Tesla's business has been hit by the slowdown in EV sales. Musk told investors in January 2024 that the automaker was ""between two major growth waves.""     Tesla products   From least to most expensive, the  Tesla models  are Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X. The company also sells the  Tesla Cybertruck , a futuristic pickup truck that it began delivering to customers in 2023, and the  Tesla Semi , an 18-wheeler that was released in 2022 and is Tesla's first commercial vehicle. Because Tesla sells direct to consumers, its prices have been known to change. The entry-level Tesla  Model 3 cost  is one that often fluctuates. Tesla's Model S , a luxury family sedan, is the EV maker's oldest vehicle still in production. It costs nearly $75,000 for the most basic version, and Tesla claims it's the most aerodynamic production car on Earth. Tesla delivered the first Model S to a customer in June 2012. For a buyer comparing  Tesla Model 3 vs. The  Model X SUV  is the biggest and most expensive vehicle Tesla sells to everyday drivers. Tesla's smaller SUV is the  Model Y , which is one of Tesla's cheaper offerings alongside the Model 3 sedan. The Cybertruck  is the newest addition to Tesla's vehicle lineup. It's also extremely pricey, with the cheapest Cybertruck starting at just under $100,000 — though Tesla has said cheaper versions of the Cybertruck will be coming next year. EV features   Some  Tesla features  are what you might expect from a modern electric car, like the app and keycard. Others reflect Musk's unique sense of humor and have added to Tesla's cult following. Tesla interiors  were among the first to cut the instrument cluster and introduce a steering yoke. Tesla's Full Self-Driving software beta was first released in 2020 and is now available to anyone who pays for the software upon request. Tesla FSD  is not self-driving, despite the name. Charging and batteries   Superchargers are the fastest way to charge a Tesla and the closest you can get to gas station-like refueling times. The company offers a  Tesla Supercharger map  where users can look up locations of chargers. Where possible,  Tesla Supercharger cost  is charged per kilowatt hour (kWh) used. Where Tesla is unable to bill per kilowatt hour, they will instead charge a per-minute fee. To access the Tesla network as a non-Tesla owner, you will need the Tesla smartphone app. A  Tesla destination charger  lets users charge their cars at locations like hotels, malls, and restaurants. There are ways to charge your Tesla without stopping to charge — some are more realistic than others. One YouTuber's experiment involved a  Tesla with a generator , powering his Model S during an 1,800-mile road trip through the Midwest without stopping to plug in. (He did have to stop for gas for his generator, ironically.)   How long does it take to charge a Tesla  at home? You can also charge with a $230 Tesla mobile connector plugged into any standard outlet and get from three to 30 miles of range per hour charged. Tesla guarantees its batteries for eight years or 100,000-150,000 miles, whichever comes first. The  cost of Tesla battery replacement  would be steep. In 2019, Elon Musk put the cost between $5,000 and $10,000. EV competitor comparisons   Tesla isn't the EV game in town, with new competitors popping up all the time. But are any worth considering over a Tesla? One up-and-coming electric car brand gunning for some of Tesla's success is Polestar. The Tesla Model 3 competes directly with the Polestar 2. Putting  Tesla vs Polestar  head to head reveals that the brands have a lot in common, including online ordering, simple interiors, and an emphasis on performance. Rivian, one of the most successful electric vehicle startups in the US, is another Tesla competitor. The Tesla Model X and Cybertruck pickup compete with Rivian's R1T pickup and R1S SUV. When comparing  Tesla vs. Tesla's cars are more about on-road performance, and they deliver that in spades, particularly if you choose a sportier model, like the  Tesla Model S Plaid . Lucid's CEO, Peter Rawlinson, was previously a top engineer at Tesla. In a Tesla vs. Lucid matchup, Tesla's closest competitor would be its Model S sedan, which also delivers tons of range, awe-inspiring quickness, and lots of advanced technology. Future products   EV fans are patiently waiting on several  future Tesla models , including a new roadster, a cheap EV, and a self-driving taxi. Tesla is expected to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi in October.

Also, Tesla has decided to delay updates on older Teslas without the latest FSD hardware, and my 2019 Model 3 doesn’t have the latest hardware. While initial reports on FSD 12.5 seemed positive, another user provided a short review that seems to bring us back to that “see-saw effect” theory I put out there years ago and  Elon Musk recently confirmed . Because of how much FSD has improved this year, I’m a bit more bullish on Tesla’s approach again. But I continue to be concerned about the see-saw effect, especially due to  how  Tesla is improving FSD — with neural nets and machine learning. Elon Musk didn’t promise a date for robotaxis back in 2016, as some people claim, but he did say the hardware put in cars at the time would be all the hardware needed for robotaxi capability, while also showing estimates of gross profit per mile and gross profit per year from a Tesla robotaxi. Now, some of those buyers are getting quite upset, and even more so with FSD updates no longer rolling out to them when they roll out to Tesla owners with newer FSD hardware. There are a series of issues above here, so let me just summarize with a bullet list:     Tesla FSD 12.5.3 has made notable improvements according to some public testers, but it has also made some odd steps backward. Tesla owners with newer cars and the most recent FSD hardware are now getting updates much sooner than others (and this was announced earlier by Elon Musk).",positive,0.998

However, the answer to that question is more complicated than it might seem at first, partly because of Tesla’s unique approach to changing and updating models. Let’s explore the history of the Model S so far, and see why Tesla currently has no plans for a Model S 2.0. At the time, Tesla was a little-known four-year-old startup, two years into producing its very first model, the Roadster. Soon after, clashes began between Fisker and Elon Musk, leading to Franz von Holzhausen being appointed lead designer, while Peter Rawlinson was put in charge of engineering the thing. Manufacturing began three years later at a former Toyota and GM facility, newly acquired by Tesla in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Related     The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N and Tesla Model 3 Performance are democratizing power and proving EVs can be fun to drive. The 2017 Facelift                   Halfway through 2016, Tesla announced the Model S, now three years old, was going to receive a facelift, with the updated vehicles going on sale for the 2017 model year. Around this time,  over-the-air updates began to gain traction , with Tesla as one of the pioneers: customers had the option to increase the battery capacity of their 60D to 75 kWh with an over-the-air update. A New Lineup                   The next major change arrived two years later, in 2019: Tesla introduced a new, simplified naming convention for the Model S lineup. The Palladium Project And Beyond                   The facelifted Model S had been on the market for just two years when Tesla debuted the next major update; this redesign had been known internally as the “Palladium” project. In 2023, the Standard Range model, absent from the Tesla family for four years, was reintroduced to the lineup. While it might be a fair assumption to think the Model S doesn’t have much room for improvement left, Tesla has a way of surprising people, and with the development of increasingly drastic over-the-air updates, they might just have a few more tricks up their sleeve. To put it simply, the reason why Tesla hasn’t brought out a second generation of the Model S is that it’s already here. So many changes have been made that the Model S you can buy today has very little in common with the one Tesla released a decade ago. This has a lot to do with the way Tesla approaches the automotive market: marketing themselves as innovative disruptors, doing things differently from legacy automakers.",neutral,0.995

While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage.

He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.

He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers.

In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.

Another said that an illegal hookup to power “Señora Pelo’s little stand with a light bulb and two fryers” is one thing; trying to charge a Tesla is another. Sánchez said a fire in a Tesla or any electric vehicle can be extremely challenging for firefighters for two reasons: A large amount of water is needed to extinguish the flames in a car laden with batteries that store power. Several news outlets reported the Tesla belonging to an American tourist, and one, the newspaper La Jornada, wondered why he or she made the illegal hookup “since in Tijuana there are charging stations for electric vehicles.”   Tesla has been in the Mexican news often in recent months,  mainly due to CEO Elon Musk announcing it has “paused” its gigafactory project in Nuevo León , but also due to viral photos of   a Tesla Model 3 being crushed by a huge, stone-carved Olmec head  (not really).",neutral,0.994

The 2024  Tesla Model S Plaid  is just about the most capable car available on the market right now, boasting an insane list of performance stats, in addition to genuine daily driver usability. Everything ranging from the Tesla Model S Plaid's 0 – 60 mph time to the cargo capacity has been covered. CarBuzz has collected all stats and specs from Tesla directly, unless specified otherwise. Related     The Tesla cheats slightly, but the race is still entertaining. 1.99: Gone In A Flash                                       Tesla          The 2024 Tesla Model S Plaid is full of party tricks and headline figures, and one such figure is the Model S Plaid's 0 – 60 mph time of just  1.99 seconds . That's a full half second faster than the Tesla Model X Plaid's 0 – 60 mph time, which currently stands at 2.5 seconds. Only a very  small number of cars can challenge the 0 – 60 mph time  of the Tesla, all of which are hypercars, apart from the  incredibly specialist Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 . 9.23: Blink And You'll Miss It                                       Tesla          This Tesla isn't just quick up to 60 mph either, as demonstrated by its 0 – 100 mph time, which is just 4.19 seconds. It's widely known that electric cars are quick to accelerate, but 9.23 seconds is seriously quick, even for a Tesla. In comparison, the Model X Plaid completes the quarter-mile dash in 9.83 seconds, while the Performance-trim Model Y and Model 3 Tesla cars need over 11 seconds to cover the same distance. Bear in mind that the Tesla Model S Plaid's 0 – 100 mph time is just over four seconds, and you can just imagine what speeds you'd be hitting by the time you reach the end of the strip.

Thanks to a tri-motor setup, the rather humble-looking Tesla delivers a monumental  1,020 horsepower , which is distributed to all four wheels. This is where the Plaid differs – it doesn't lack any of the other genuinely useful features of the lower trims, but Tesla, by adding that third motor, has ensured the Plaid is something of a genuine spectacle.

One area in which Tesla definitely delivers, is audio. 64.5: More Than Just Pace                                       Tesla          As a further attempt to demonstrate that speed isn't all the Tesla Model S Plaid is good for, take a look at the cargo capacity available. Furthermore, even with the seats in place, Tesla owners have more space to play with than the likes of Lucid Air or Porsche Taycan owners. 21: Make A Statement                                       Tesla          Priced at $89,990, or as Tesla likes to display, $83,490 with 'estimated five-year gas savings' of $6,500 taken into account, the Model S Plaid isn't to be considered a 'cheap' car. 359: Plaid Can Go The Distance                                       Tesla         This figure won't be especially useful to those who just want to surprise sports cars at the lights and sample the Plaid's immense power.

Tesla promised that FSD would be available in a matter of months, and I was eager to be part of this self-driving revolution. I was leasing the car and heard rumors from Tesla salespeople about possible transferability, meaning I could take my FSD purchase with me to a future Tesla. I envisioned upgrading my Tesla like I do with my iPhone—every couple of years, I’d get the latest model, and my FSD would follow me. All modern Teslas already have the necessary hardware for FSD, so technically, this is something Tesla could implement. It makes no sense to tie such a large, expensive software investment to a single car, especially considering how often Tesla updates and releases new models. After all, it's not just software; it’s a commitment many Tesla drivers make under the assumption that they’re future-proofing their driving experience. But Tesla seems more interested in playing the game of maximizing profit than considering fairness to its customers. And to be honest, while I love the cars themselves, Tesla as a company leaves a lot to be desired. Tesla's price manipulation is one of the most frustrating aspects for owners like me. I had ordered a Tesla Model S Plaid for $148,000, only to see the price drop to $105,000 within a year. And this isn’t just about FSD pricing—it’s happening across the board, with Tesla playing fast and loose with their prices, hurting customers financially. Current Tesla owners who are still considering FSD should ask themselves whether it’s worth the hefty price tag. Tesla may cut prices again, and if FSD remains tied to a specific vehicle, you'll lose that investment if you upgrade or switch cars. Should Tesla offer refunds or credits for early adopters who paid significantly more than what the package costs today? For those who’ve already purchased FSD, it raises a deeper question: Should Tesla be held accountable for changing the terms and expectations after the fact? As a longtime Tesla owner—I’m currently on my third Tesla and have two in my garage right now—I feel conflicted. Tesla’s hardware and software are unmatched in many ways, which is why I continue to drive them and plan to buy another. We’re buying into a futuristic vision, and Tesla should treat its customers like we’re part of that vision, not just dollar signs. This was adopted from a comment, a Tesla owner, named Brian, wrote under our previous story, titled: "" Tesla Cuts FSD Prices to as Low as $4,500 – Owners Who Paid $15,000 Demand a Refund .""   So, Tesla FSD owners, are you with Brian? He has more than a decade of expertise in the automotive industry with a special interest in Tesla and electric vehicles.",neutral,0.989

I do think it’s important stuff to consider and discuss, though, because Tesla is still one of the most important and influential companies in the EV world, and thus the world at large. What happens with Tesla may not be as important today as it was a decade ago, but it’s still extremely important. “Else, his restlessness combined with his dominant behavior will increasingly become a liability for Tesla. However, I do think that while many people agree with  Jec  that Musk needs to move on, there are also many people (especially TSLA shareholders) who think he needs to keep running Tesla in order to keep it revolutionary. They don’t want Tesla to be “just another car company” and strongly believe in Musk’s robotaxi, AI, and robotics plans. Though, personally, I think more people would probably be wise to guard against the notion that “because someone succeeded before, they will succeed again in this other way.” Maybe Musk will be right on Tesla AI, robotaxis, and robotics. However, Elon Musk saw an opening as that one would change his view of folks who would bend the knee and send lots of $. Though, while many  Tesla  fans would now like to see Musk step down from his role as CEO, I think another anecdote from that new book,  Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter , shows us that he won’t. When he landed, he found that ‘57.5 percent of the more than 17.5 million accounts that had voted were calling for him to resign.’ Between this rejection and the plummeting value of Tesla stock, Musk became withdrawn and unresponsive, with those who did manage to talk to him worrying that he was ‘in the throes of a manic event.’ Speaking with one confidante, ‘Musk choked up and began to doubt his ability to run the company’ in light of the poll results, saying, ‘I’m never going to recover from this.’ He would, of course, go on to hire  Linda Yaccarino  as a replacement CEO in the new year — though as anyone still active on the site that soon became X will tell you, it continues to reflect his worst impulses and warped worldview.”   Musk doesn’t want to give up control of Tesla. Though, whereas this Twitter poll told Musk what he didn’t want to hear and thought he wouldn’t hear, in the case of Tesla, shareholders just recently revived his massive compensation package and basically gave him a full stamp of approval to keep running Tesla however he sees fit.

The Wall Street Journal wrote  that under a proposed agreement described to investors, Tesla would use xAI models in its driver-assistance software (known as Full Self-Driving or FSD). The AI startup would also help develop features such as a voice assistant in Tesla vehicles and software for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus. Writing on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter),  Musk said  he hadn’t read the WSJ story, but he described a post summarizing the report as “not accurate.”   “Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI,” he wrote. “The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in compressed form, most of human knowledge, and couldn’t possibly run on the Tesla vehicle inference computer, nor would we want them to.”   Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI (which he co-founded but eventually left). TechCrunch reported earlier this year  that as part of the pitch for  xAI’s $6 billion funding round , the startup outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies (Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink and X), and its models could then improve technology across those companies. Tesla shareholders have sued Musk  over the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing company.",neutral,0.995

Some of that was down to the long delays ahead of production beginning, some of it was down to design, and many lay blame at the feet of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   Drive one of these polarizing trucks, and you can apparently expect harsh words and middle fingers just about wherever you go. It might be made out of stainless steel, but the Cybertruck is a magnet for the haters — whether haters of EVs or haters of Elon Musk. The Cybertruck was an instant laughing stock when its bulletproof windows famously shattered at Tesla’s big announcement event. Credit: David Tracy I chatted to members of the  Tesla Cybertruck Owners  group on Facebook, and heard from Floridian owner Marcus Story. “As an early adopter of Tesla vehicles, I’ve experienced firsthand what it’s like to own an EV in a southern car-loving town, and it has certainly been interesting!”   “Politics and election seasons play a significant role in people’s perceptions—many instantly assume you vote a certain way just because you drive a Tesla,” Marcus explains. Also, hat tip to Tesla for putting out some fresh Cybertruck press pics. Numerous members of the Tesla Cybertruck Owners group reported people “rolling coal” on them, wherein a diesel truck dumps a large plume of black exhaust smoke on other cars. “I am also progressive, but some of my friends in this area don’t agree that Tesla is a good company.” A lot of it comes down to the Tesla CEO in her eyes. I had a chance to talk with Don Turner — the LA-based Tesla owner who works in the senior care industry and whose Facebook post inspired this article — after Lewin finished writing this piece, and I figured I’d add some notes about our chat. Turner’s post was about the mistreatment he’s received as a Tesla Cybertruck owner (that’s his truck below; he’s very proud of it). “Very few people say they like the truck because of Elon Musk; nobody really claims to like the guy,” Turner told me before making his thoughts on Musk clear. “Elon Musk… that jackass — I like his technology, I like his truck — ….he doesn’t shut his freakin’ mouth. I just don’t like Elon Musk. If he sticks to the technology and building companies, there’s no one smarter.”   “Once he gets into the political stuff, it really ruins his brand, it ruins the Tesla brand,” he told me, saying loads of folks dislike his truck specifically because of the controversial CEO.",negative,0.995

Tesla remains one of the most competitive EV brands in the world. Tesla's Plaid twins are a perfect example of this, as they act as highly aspirational examples that motivate more potential consumers to buy into the brand. Looking beyond this, Tesla's Plaid option is one of the more special and exhilarating electric car options in its very concentrated catalog, which is a factor that's unlikely to change for quite some time. Related     Tesla's premier performance model outperforms these 10 substantially more expensive supercar rivals. Tesla's World-Class Triple-Motor Plaid Configuration                   Tesla applies an innovative triple electric motor system to the Model S and Model X Plaid's drivetrain, with a focus on efficiency, high performance, and a balanced power distribution. Tesla also optimized the stator's design, focusing on tighter windings and better heat dissipation, which enhances efficiency. Key Features Of The Plaid's Triple Electric Motors                                                   The Tesla Plaid's electric motors feature carbon-sleeved rotors, allowing them to spin at extremely high RPMs without structural expansion. Tesla uses a tri-motor setup, with two rear motors for independent torque vectoring and enhanced handling precision. Tesla's use of lightweight materials in motor construction reduces overall mass, improving acceleration and driving dynamics without sacrificing durability. Tesla employs a                lithium-ion chemistry  for the battery, optimizing it for energy density and longevity. Related     The Tesla Model S Plaid is the world's quickest production cars while being as practical as the next-door full-size sedan. Tesla Model X Plaid And Model S Plaid Specifications                                       Bring-a-Trailer          Both the Tesla Model S Plaid and Model X Plaid feature identical drivetrains, producing 1,020 horsepower and 1,050 pound-feet of torque to all four wheels, but there are considerable performance differences between the sedan and its SUV counterpart. Weighing in at just 4,766 pounds, Tesla claims you'll be able to enjoy 0-60 MPH acceleration speeds as fast as 1.99 seconds with a one-foot rollout subtracted. Related     Discover the engineering marvels that propel the Tesla Model X Plaid to astonishing speeds, from its tri-motor setup to advanced battery technology. How Fast Tesla Plaid Models Are                                       Bring-a-Trailer           We all know that the Tesla Plaid models are more than                 fast enough in a straight line  , but the true test of speed is conducted on the racetrack. Tesla's Model S and X Plaid feature significant suspension upgrades to handle their high-performance capabilities and increased weight capacities.

You can now buy a brand new Tesla Model 3 — with all of its recent upgrades — and pay $0 at delivery. (The federal interest rate is currently 5.50%, so that means Tesla is subsidizing the interest rate for you.) Note that these opportunities are available if you apply the federal tax credit for EVs at the point of sale. Here’s a screenshot of the brief email Tesla just sent along:     You can also get $1,000 of using a Tesla owner’s referral code. Image courtesy of Tesla. Stepping back and looking more broadly at the Tesla story, this new offer, including the September 30 deadline, imply to me that Tesla doesn’t naturally have enough consumer demand to move all of the vehicles it wants to move in the United States. That doesn’t mean Tesla is facing a consumer demand or sales crisis. Perhaps these mild incentives will result in Tesla selling all the vehicles it could produce in the 3rd quarter in the United States. We’ll see soon what Tesla is able to achieve this quarter. One positive thing I’d note here is that Tesla didn’t resort to this new incentive until late in the quarter, just a couple of weeks before the quarter ends. It may pull in many more buyers (maybe), but I don’t think it’ll cost Tesla much. What are your thoughts on the new $0-down Tesla pitch? And will you or anyone you know now make the final decision to buy a Tesla thanks to this new offer?",negative,0.994

US firefighters used some 190,000 liters of water to extinguish a blaze involving an electric Tesla Semi truck this month following a crash, a government agency said. The crash involving the Tesla Semi took place in the wee hours of August 19 as the vehicle was traveling near Emigrant Gap in California, the NTSB said. The semi-truck operated by a Tesla employee was headed from Livermore, California, to a Tesla facility in Sparks, Nevada.

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas. The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. 17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained. He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. 17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive. 17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has",negative,0.994

In the five years since I bought my Model 3, Tesla Inc. And it’s introduced me to a Tesla universe of owners as passionate as any Porsche and Mustang club. I’ve driven the Model 3 all over, including to Park City, Utah, and twice to the (Florida) Keys.” I bought my first, rear-wheel-drive, 271-horsepower, $58,450 Model 3 in fall 2018, then traded it for an all-wheel-drive, 473-horsepower, $63,940 Model 3 Performance model a year later when Tesla temporarily dropped the price by $15k. From its “production Hell” while Tesla struggled to meet a flood of 250,000 orders, Model 3 has stabilized as the No. It’s even been a political lightning rod with Tesla CEO Elon Musk swinging from being the scourge of the Right (after taking a $465 million taxpayer loan from the Obama administration) to the bane of the Left (when he restored former President Donald Trump’s Twitter account). Rick Snyder’s state ban (more politics!) on Tesla service centers. Service Tesla’s first in-state service center opened on Dixie Highway just west of downtown Clarkston in May 2020. Yes, Tesla makes house calls). Service appointments are activated by the Tesla app. Combined with testing other vehicles, that keeps mileage on my Tesla low. At a cost of 15 cents/per kWh, the Tesla is significantly cheaper to fuel than a comparable gas car (say, the 19 mpg BMW M2 that I had my eyes on before Musk introduced the Model 3 in 2016). Tesla Superchargers cost 39 cents/per kWh for a total of $31 over 237 miles. Tesla’s navigation system smartly plans the trip, including suggestions for restaurants/stores near chargers. Tesla claims its batteries will retain at least 70% of charge over eight years, but battery-data firm Recurrent studied real-world Tesla driving range and found average battery degradation to 64% of capacity after three years. Competition For good and ill, Tesla has been a pioneer — charting its own path on charging networks, manufacturer-run showrooms, even a proprietary digital infotainment system. Neither Sirius XM nor digital versions of my favorite AM stations are available, and Tesla also refuses Apple CarPay and Android Auto compatibility. It’s Tesla’s secret sauce — so much so that other automakers have rushed to give their customers access, beginning with Ford Motor Co. That access will narrow Tesla’s advantage (while padding profits) as will Google Built-in, a new operating system that runs GM/Honda/Volvo EVs and that is Tesla’s equal in charting trips. Synonymous with the autonomous revolution, Tesla once promised owners they’d be able to rent their cars as autonomous taxis. But my car’s Autopilot system has continuously improved with OTA updates to offer Tesla's Full Self-Driving system today.",neutral,0.996

The  Tesla Model 3 Highland brings a refreshed design , updated technology, and various improvements that aim to keep it competitive in the rapid and ever-evolving world of electric cars. However, not everything about the Tesla Model 3 Highland refresh is necessarily an improvement. All key information has been sourced from Tesla directly, unless stated otherwise.

Tesla is considered the world's most valuable car brand as of 2023, and the  Model Y the world's best-selling car  in the same year, but the brand's greatest achievement is arguably the Supercharger network of EV charging stations.

Tesla has given the car a more refined look, with a streamlined front bumper and slimmer headlights that enhance its sleekness. Not only does this contribute to the Tesla Model 3 Highland looking sharper on the road, but it also improves its energy efficiency and range. Regarding the Model 3 Performance specifically, Tesla claims 5% less drag and a 36% reduction in lift. 2                                 The Interior Displays Have Been Updated                          As before, the interior of the Tesla Model 3 is dominated by a large center touchscreen interface. 3                                 Cabin Quality Is Better Than Before                                              Tesla         Tesla has made notable strides in improving the materials and overall fit and finish of the new Model 3 Highland.

Tesla has added more sound insulation, 360-degree acoustic glass, and better body baffles and sealing, making the Model 3 a much quieter ride. 7                                 Class-Leading Performance And Improved Range                                              Tesla                      Impressive Acceleration Across The Lineup        When it comes to performance, the Tesla Model 3 Highland still leads the pack in many ways.

Here's How Much A 3-Year-Old Tesla Model 3 Is Worth Today - Top Speed,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE11c0ZEUUoyT21Rb2RRbllTX0wxaGZTSkJSTFRsQW9ESkxWdGZUdDEyRk4yQmdFNjMyY1g4aFBYbFNsSW5NcEZpZGlUVGZQTzl3bjZZNnM1MVJUS1g0Nmg4WHNHak1DRkROQndSN0VXLUFpZzA?oc=5,"Sun, 15 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","As  electric vehicles  (EVs) continue to rise in popularity, the  Tesla Model 3  remains a top choice for drivers looking to make the switch. It is at the forefront of EV tech, its impressive range, and                 Tesla’s signature minimalist desig  have made it one of the most sought-after electric sedans. But for those not looking to purchase a brand-new Tesla, an  older Model 3  could be the perfect solution. With Tesla’s over-the-air updates keeping even older models feeling fresh, a used Model 3 retains much of the appeal of its newer counterparts. Whether you're after the sleek design,                 Autopilot  , or simply the thrill of driving an EV, a three-year-old Model 3 offers a unique opportunity to experience Tesla’s excellence without the brand-new price tag. In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla and other authoritative sources, including KBB, Edmunds, and J.D. Related     The Tesla Model 3 gets all grown up with a mid-life update courtesy of a new face, more range, and Porsche-bating performance. Here's How Much A 3-Year-Old Tesla Model 3 Is Worth Today                   If you're looking at grabbing one of Tesla's best-selling vehicles, the Model 3, you're likely to find that even a model a few years older is still pretty pricey. These EVs hold their value fairly well, and that is all thanks to the innovative design, features, and stellar performance that comes from the Tesla brand. With Tesla's over-the-air software updates and high demand, the Model 3 depreciates slower than many traditional ICE cars. On average, a 2021 Tesla Model 3 is priced between $26,600 and $33,200, depending on the trim level and condition. These prices reflect the enduring appeal of Tesla’s electric sedans, as well as their minimal maintenance costs among the ongoing innovations. Tesla Model 3 Depreciation Over 3 Years                            Tesla         In terms of depreciation, the Tesla Model 3 follows a pattern similar to other luxury vehicles, but with a slightly more favorable curve. The Tesla Model 3’s strong residual value is a statement in its desirability, particularly among tech-savvy buyers looking for an EV with cutting-edge features like Autopilot and access to the  expansive Supercharger network . How Much A Tesla Model 3 Might Depreciate Beyond Three Years                            Tesla         Looking beyond the three-year mark, depreciation tends to slow, especially as Tesla continues to offer over-the-air updates that keep older models fresh. However, with the growing popularity of electric vehicles and Tesla’s solid reputation, the Model 3 is likely to remain competitive in the used car market. Tesla has always been a strong contender, and it still holds good value even for the  decade-old 2014 Model S . Related     The electrified segment is booming, and here are 10 EVs the Tesla Model 3 stepped over to claim the second spot as the best-selling EV. Used                                       Tesla          Deciding between a new or used Tesla Model 3 depends on your priorities. Tesla’s 2024 lineup continues to push boundaries with improvements in range and performance, but you'll be paying a premium—starting at $33,390 for the rear-wheel drive base model. 2024 Tesla Model 3 RWD Specs                  Powertrain       Single electric motor           Transmission       Single-speed direct drive           Driveline       RWD           Horsepower       271 HP           Torque       310 pound-feet           0-60 MPH       5.8 Seconds           Top Speed       125 MPH             On the other hand, a three-year-old Model 3 gives you many of the same features for significantly less money, with the added bonus of lower depreciation moving forward. However, the trade-off might be a shorter remaining warranty and older technology that could become outdated as Tesla has rolled out the facelifted version of the Model 3 just this year. Tesla Model 3 Pricing                            Tesla         For a used 2021 Tesla Model 3, the Standard Range Plus trim currently starts at around $26,594 according to KBB fair market value, while the Long Range version goes for about $31,600. These prices are reflective of Tesla’s unique position in the market, where demand for EVs keeps resale values robust. 2021 Tesla Model 3 Vs. 2024 Tesla Model 3        When comparing the 2024 Tesla Model 3 to the 2021 version, there are several notable changes that could influence your decision, depending on what you prioritize in an electric vehicle. Trim Options:  The 2024 Tesla Model 3 introduces a facelift to the lineup, with improved range and slightly enhanced features across all trims. While the trims remain largely the same—Standard Range, Long Range, and Performance—the 2024 versions include slight updates in both design and functionality, keeping them more in line with Tesla’s evolving technology. Pricing:  Starting at approximately $40,000, the 2024 Tesla Model 3 has a higher base price than the 2021 model did at launch. Tesla has refined the soundproofing and added more durable upholstery options to the latest model. Overall, the  2024 Tesla Model 3 builds upon the solid foundation  of the 2021 model, offering more range, more refined driving, and small but impactful interior updates that will appeal to those seeking the latest in electric vehicle",positive,0.998

Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   While we’re exploring the big questions in this chapter of The Morning Dump, why do we think used car sales suddenly took off in August? “More And More People Have Just Had It With [Musk]”   Credit:  depositphotos.com   Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously moved the HQ of his company from Silicon Valley, where Tesla was born, to Austin, Texas. There’s  some evidence that people are not buying Teslas as Musk’s favorability slips , though Tesla is still by far the biggest electric carmaker in America and I know plenty of people who held their noses and bought Model Ys because they were such a good deal. According to S&P Mobility,  via this  Automotive News  article , it’s not going well for Tesla:   “I pull up to an intersection and every car is a Tesla Model Y, and I’m also driving one because it’s the modern Toyota Camry,” said Loren McDonald, head of Silicon Valley consultancy EVAdoption. “But there are a lot of reluctant Tesla owners who don’t want to give Elon any more money. More and more people have just had it with him.”   In Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, new Tesla registrations fell 22 percent from January through July from the same period a year earlier, while EV rivals saw 41 percent growth, according to S&P Global Mobility. The dramatic decline in Tesla registrations, while everyone else is going up, isn’t a great sign. Tesla also fell 21% across all Silicon Valley counties, though rivals only grew by 1.4% when the other counties are considered. So who is picking up market share from Tesla? Tesla was still the top EV brand in California with 56 percent of the market, although that was a big drop from its 64 percent share in the year-earlier period, according to S&P Global Mobility. Brands gaining on Tesla for EV registrations include Hyundai with 55 percent growth from January through July compared with a year earlier. Competition was always inevitable for Tesla and the degree to which Musk’s behavior is accelerating a market share decline is likely hard to prove.",positive,0.998

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas. The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. 17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained. He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. 17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells.

The Cost Of Charging Your Tesla In Hawaii                   As of May 2024, the  average cost of electricity in Hawaii  was 44.14 cents per kWh according to Statista. As the current best-selling Tesla model in the US, we will look at the Model Y as an example. 78.1 multiplied by $0.4414 equals a full charge price of  $34.47 : this is, on average, how much it will cost to charge your Tesla Model Y as a Hawaii resident. This means, on average, you can expect to pay somewhere between $25 and $45 to charge your Tesla as a Hawaii resident. Level 1 chargers are only a viable day-to-day solution for Tesla owners who have access to overnight charging and a short commute, keeping daily mileage low. Tesla’s own wall connectors are Level 2 chargers, meaning they can access up to 240V: this makes them a good option for everyday use, allowing the car to fully charge overnight and make use of its full range, from longer commutes to school runs and everything in between. Tesla And Charging: Home Chargers And The Supercharger Network                                       Tesla         Tesla, of course, isn’t quite like other EV brands when it comes to charging. The company has set up its own fast charging system dubbed the Supercharger network, which offers Tesla owners exclusive access to proprietary fast chargers (that being said, other carmakers’ models are now due to have access to the Supercharger network soon, negating the exclusivity factor). A fourth location, also on Oahu, is currently an available option for a  public vote  on where to install future Superchargers; Tesla owners are able to cast their vote for their preferred location on the brand’s website.

EV Energy Usage Explained                                       Tesla                      What Is A Kilowatt? Instead of a 15-gallon fuel tank, an EV like a Tesla may have a battery size of 50 kWh, which means the battery can store up to 50-kilowatt hours worth of energy, or 'fuel'. In a Tesla, those kWh are used to provide miles on the road. If, for example, a Tesla could achieve 40 miles per kWh, then that would be the efficiency rating. Charging A Tesla Takes More Energy Than You Would First Assume                   There is an ideal scenario for charging an electric car, and it's really quite simple. In theory, a 75-kWh battery from the  2024 Tesla Model 3  Long Range and Performance models should take 75 kWh of energy to charge, which would make the equation nice and simple to calculate. The type of charger used to charge a Tesla will also have an impact on the amount of energy lost, as AC-DC power conversion will sap the power potential. This means, in order to calculate the amount of kWh required to charge a Tesla, an average energy loss of 10% needs to be factored in. How Different Chargers Affect The Efficiency Of Charging A Tesla                                       Tesla                      Different Charger Types            Supercharger : Up to 200 miles of range in 15 minutes                              Wall Connector : Up to 44 miles of range per hour of charge                              Destination Charging : Up to 44 miles of range per hour of charge                              Mobile Charging (240V) : Up to 30 miles of range per hour of charge                              Mobile Charging (120V) : Up to 3 miles of range per hour of charge                              Tesla offers a wide choice of chargers to its customers , each providing a unique set of benefits and disadvantages. The most effective is Tesla's Supercharger network. For this and other reasons, most customers will choose to charge their Tesla models at home, via a wall connector. It is also common for energy providers to charge less per kWh throughout the night, which is why it makes great sense to charge a Tesla overnight, at home. Here's How Much Energy It Takes To Charge A Tesla In 2024                                       Tesla          So, in order to calculate how many kilowatts it takes to charge a Tesla, the inefficiencies of charging have to be taken into account, which we will represent as an average of 10%. While many new models, such as  the Tesla Model Y Juniper , are set to be released soon, we have used a range of only current 2024 models as examples. Using this method, we know that the amount of energy required to charge an entry-level Tesla Model 3's 58-kWh battery is 63.8 kWh. As for how many kWh you'll need to charge a Tesla Model Y Long Range, that works out to 89.1 kWh. Taking into account the most amount of energy lost is the Tesla Cybertruck (in Cyberbeast trim), wasting a total of 12.3 kWh in energy loss, in order to charge the 123-kWh battery pack. The different Tesla kWh capacity specs per model are listed below.

Analysts are expecting  Elon Musk ’s automaker to report about 463,310 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. That would include about 435,900 of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs. Tesla reported deliveries of 435,059 and production of 430,488 vehicles for the  same period a year ago , before it was selling the Cybertruck. More recently, Tesla reported deliveries of 443,956 and production of 410,831 vehicles for the second quarter of 2024. If Tesla meets analysts’ expectations that would represent a 6.5% year-over-year increase for deliveries after declines in the  first  and  second  quarters of 2024. Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but they are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. In the third quarter, as it did earlier this year, Tesla continued to offer a variety of incentives and financing plans to drive sales volumes, particularly in the largest market for EVs in the world, mainland China. Tesla hasn’t given specific guidance for the full year of deliveries in 2024, but the company has said it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last. Wells Fargo, pointing to this lack of guidance, said in a note that it’s expecting 1.63 million full-year deliveries for Tesla and third-quarter deliveries at around 440,000, below consensus. Goldman Sachs last week said it expects Tesla deliveries and production “to come in-line with consensus, largely driven by the strength in the China market.” Goldman Sachs recommended  buying call options  ahead of the Wednesday report. Tesla plans to host investors and fans at its “We, Robot” marketing event at a  Warner Bros. Tesla may also provide updates on its humanoid robotics project “Optimus” and other automotive and AI-driven products and services. Tesla EV sales and revenue fell in the first half of 2024, and the company still has yet to deliver a self-driving system that can function as a robotaxi without a human driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time. Tesla also  renamed  its premium driver assistance option to Full Self-Driving Supervised, tacking on a disclaimer-style term at the end. Tesla brand erosion Some customer interest in buying Tesla vehicles has been chilled by the brand’s strong association with Musk. Tesla favorability dropped with Democrats to 18% in July, down from 39% in January, and it declined among Republicans to 22%, down from 36% in January. Before Musk acquired Twitter, now known as X, his feed focused more on Tesla and SpaceX, according to an analysis by  The Washington Post.",neutral,0.996

Available Models      Select Available Models   Cybertruck   Model 3   Model S   Model S Performance   Model S Plaid   Model X   Model X Performance   Model X Plaid   Model Y   Roadster                 Tesla, Inc. Through the Model S and subsequent products, Tesla has innovated and challenged industry conventions on numerous fronts, including over-the-air updates, self-driving technology, and automotive construction methods. Tesla is considered the world's most valuable car brand as of 2023, and the  Model Y the world's best-selling car  in the same year, but the brand's greatest achievement is arguably the Supercharger network of EV charging stations.

However, in the case of the  Tesla Model S Plaid , things are a little different. The Tesla sports three electric motors, which work in cohesion with one another in order to develop a supercar-challenging 1,020 horsepower, alongside 1,050 lb-ft of torque. Furthermore, as is the nature of electric cars, the Tesla does not need to fire through thousands of revs, or spool up a handful of turbochargers in order to access that immense power. 2                                 Best Tesla For Range                                     Tesla Model S All-Wheel Drive                            Tesla          The 2024 Tesla Model S is more than just a one-trick pony. This sees the range swell to an impressive 402 miles, which is the most of any model from the firm at the moment, making it the best Tesla available for all things concerning range. Thanks to the ever-evolving Tesla Supercharger charging network, range anxiety can be a thing of the past, too, as the Model S AWD can add 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes at one of these fast-charging stations. The Tesla Model S All-Wheel Drive only achieves 402 miles on standard 19-inch wheels. 3                                 Best Tesla For Practicality                                     Tesla Model X                  2024 Tesla Model X Interior Space               Front row headroom / legroom       41.7 / 41.1 inches           Second row headroom / legroom        40.9 / 39.8 inches           Third row headroom / legroom        37.1 / 32.2 inches           Cargo space behind second row       37.1 cubic feet           Maximum cargo capacity       91.6 cubic feet             The  2024 Tesla Model X  is not the only Tesla model to offer a third-row of seating, but, thanks to the high roofline and clever interior layout, it is the most spacious by some margin. If practicality is high up on your priorities list, this Tesla is the best model to have. 4                                 Best Sub-$40k Tesla                                     2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range                            Tesla         Electric cars are not what first springs to mind when asked about a 'cheap' car, and while the 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range is hardly cheap, it certainly is affordable for many. Tesla also claims that, with the incentives and average monthly gas savings factored in, the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive is available at just $485 per month. 5                                 Best Off-Road Tesla                                     Tesla Cybertruck                            Tesla          Tesla doesn't make much for the keen off-roader. To ensure that the controversial pickup truck can perform well on the rough stuff,  Tesla has equipped the model with numerous off-road modes , and the ability to raise the ride height on demand. This is undoubtedly one of the best Tesla models for more adventure-minded customers. 6                                 Best Tesla For Young Families                                     Tesla Model Y                            Tesla          For a car to work well for the whole family, it needs to offer a wide range of valuable features. Firstly, it needs to not cost an extortionate amount, and with prices beginning at just $44,990, the 2024 Tesla Model Y is certainly attainable. Tesla has redesigned the rear of the Model Y, to incorporate a 7.2-inch entertainment screen, which is perfect for keeping family members entertained on long drives. For all of those reasons, the Model Y is surely one of the best Tesla cars for young families. 7                                 Best Tesla For Tech Nerds                                     Fully Loaded Tesla Model S                            Tesla          One of the main draws to owning a Tesla, is that the company is constantly innovating and adding new features to their whole range. While even the cheapest of models and trims come packed full of exciting tech, the Tesla Model S is really the one to have as a technophile. Tesla allows owners to stand out from the crowd with a spaceship-esque yoke steering wheel, and while that's not exactly space-age technology, it's still pretty cool. The real lure, though, is the fact Tesla will allow you to spec a Model S with a full self-driving package, and that's about as futuristic as driving gets at the moment. What's more, the Drive Anywhere Package includes access to the entire Tesla Supercharging network, in addition to premium connectivity options too – a must-have option for anyone who loves their tech. The prices for these extras are as follows:                                              Yoke steering wheel: $1,000                                                                     Full Self-Driving package: $8,000                                                                     Drive Anywhere package: $5,000                                8                                 Best Bang For Your Buck                                     Tesla Model 3 Performance",positive,0.998

Tesla, the EV market leader, ended a five-month slump with a 1.2% increase in registrations, bolstered by 5,175 deliveries of the highly anticipated Cybertruck launched in November. Tesla maintained its dominance in the electric vehicle (EV) market, but its Model 3 sedan experienced a significant 31% drop in registrations. Despite Tesla’s dominance, non-Tesla EV registrations surged 38% year-over-year as competitors gained momentum. “These are very solid and competitive products affecting Tesla’s position.”   Nonetheless, total EV registrations for July reached 118,273, up from 100,620 in the previous year. Amid these challenges, Tesla’s overall growth and the strong performance of new entrants like the Honda Prologue and Kia EV9 suggest that the EV market continues to evolve, with fierce competition ahead as more automakers vie for leadership in this rapidly expanding segment.",positive,0.998

In the centres of the two symmetrical Tesla valves, we deposited 70-nm Au pads as transducers for performing the thermoreflectance measurements in both the forward and reverse structures. Finally, the graphite Tesla valves were suspended by the Au pads deposited on both sides of the structures in combination with the underlying SiO 2  etching using vapour-phase hydrofluoric acid. Investigation of the effect of terminal geometry in the graphite Tesla valve design To realize the reversal of heat flow in our Tesla valve, we separately designed the forward and reverse structures by rotating one by 180° to the other. First, we conducted both Monte Carlo and FEM simulations in simplified geometry, without the arm of the Tesla valve (that is, the bent channel). A laser at 642 nm was pulsed with a duration of 2 μs to periodically pump heat through the Au transducer to the Tesla valve structures. The TDTR signal thus shows the intrinsic decay of the heat injected by the pulsed (pump) laser through the Tesla valve structures in the microsecond range, as shown in Fig. The thermal conductivity of the Tesla valve is then extracted using FEM simulation implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics. To reproduce the experiment, we built 3D models with the same geometries as the measured Tesla valve in forward and reverse directions, as shown in Extended Data Fig. And the boundary condition of the edges of the Tesla valve structure is considered adiabatic, at which the thermal radiation loss of the suspended structure was estimated by the Stefan–Boltzmann law and concluded to be neglected, as well as the convection effect 56 , 57 . Thus, the in-plane thermal conductivity of the Tesla valve structure is the only fitting parameter in the simulation. For instance, by sweeping a series of thermal conductivities of the graphite Tesla valve in the forward direction at 45 K, we obtain their corresponding decay curves, as plotted in Fig. At 300 K, we obtained the thermal conductivity for the graphite Tesla valve comparable with the literature values.",neutral,0.988

Tesla is hosting an event it's calling ""We, Robot"" in Hollywood on Thursday night. Tesla is calling the event ""We, Robot."" At 7 p.m. Pacific time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is expected to unveil the company's design for a dedicated robotaxi, a Tesla designed exclusively to ferry passengers without a driver — a feat the company's semi-autonomous software has not yet demonstrated it can do. Here are 5 things to know about Tesla's big bet on autonomous driving. Musk says robotaxis are key to Tesla's future profits   Tesla makes money selling electric vehicles — in fact, its profit margins on its cars, which are consistently in the double digits, are enviable for an automaker. In addition to selling cars, Tesla sells an expensive software package called ""Full Self Driving (Supervised)."" It can autonomously direct a Tesla on a wide range of roads, and navigate stoplights, stop signs and pedestrians without human input … most of the time. He's promised they're coming next year — for years   Musk's become infamous for his overly enthusiastic estimates of how soon Tesla robotaxis will arrive. … Next year seems highly probable to me.""    The problem is that while Tesla's software can drive a vehicle without human help  much  of the time, it's not yet reliable enough to drive unassisted  all  of the time. Until they're cheaper and cover more ground, the pollsters concluded, ""the service will remain a novelty transportation method.""   Tesla's approach to autonomy is unusual — and controversial   So if robotaxis already exist, why doesn't Tesla have this tech yet? There's a big difference between how other companies — like Waymo, Cruise, the driverless trucking company Aurora and a host of startups — approach autonomy, and how Tesla is trying to do it. Musk is adamant that Tesla's approach is superior. Tesla also has enormous amounts of driving data from its vehicles on the road today. Aurora took the unusual step of preemptively emailing reporters ahead of Tesla's event this week to share bullet points about exactly what they object to. Aurora's email paraphrases points CPO Sterling Anderson made in a  recent webcast : the approach favored by Tesla, the summary notes, is a "" 'train and pray' approach where you fix a problem by throwing more data at the system – we find this to be problematic in a safety critical industry where you need confidence and proof you've actually fixed.""   Anderson used to work at Tesla, where he helped launch Tesla's Autopilot software, its first partial-automation system, the Aurora email notes. Waymo  just snagged  a former Tesla exec for its team, too. ""'How do you control it?'""   Still, Gianarikas notes that while there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about a Tesla robotaxi fleet, Elon Musk has a track record of eventually proving skeptics wrong. Visitors look at Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus at its exhibition booth during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai on July 5, 2024.

""I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else at Tesla combined,"" Musk told investors this summer. Tesla has  shared videos  of it  sorting objects , standing on one leg and  dancing . Dan Ives, an analyst and a long-time Tesla bull, will be in attendance on Thursday night.",negative,0.988

But, while those didn’t have any explicit impact on the company’s actual numbers this quarter, what  is  firing on all cylinders is the company’s energy-generation and storage business, which reported growth north of  50% , by far the best of Tesla’s divisions. Not only is the energy-generation and storage business growing rapidly, but on a relative basis it’s also significantly more profitable for Tesla than selling cars: the company reported a  31% gross profit margin  from its energy efforts, nearly double the  16%  from automotive sales. The company’s energy business ranges from  Megapack , a product aimed at large-scale utilities deployment, to products geared for end customers in smaller households like the  Tesla Powerwall , and it also sells and installs solar-power systems. Sherwood News Demand for Tesla’s energy-storage solutions is expected to only expand, especially with  growing installations  of renewable-energy sources like wind and solar, which can be volatile and require battery solutions to store the excess energy when its not blowing hard enough or sunny enough. The outlook for EV charging services like Tesla’s Supercharger is also bright, with America’s EV infrastructure  struggling  to meet demands and the ambitious roadmap to 2030. CEO Elon Musk also said on  an earnings call  that car sales would likely get back to growth next year, predicting that Tesla’s deliveries could rise  20% to 30%  next year. Of course, many Elon Musk predictions haven’t come true.",neutral,0.994

Tesla vehicles could have driven by themselves around a Warner Bros. And, importantly, Elon Musk proclaimed with great enthusiasm that Tesla cars bought back in 2018 and 2019 would be  appreciating assets —  because they were going to be able to make their owners money as robotaxis within a couple of years. I bought my 2019 Tesla Model 3 in mid-2019, with the latest notes from Musk at the time being that feature-complete Full Self Driving would be complete by the end of the year. (It was not shared until much later that it was around this same time that Tesla decided it needed to do a complete rewrite and tackle the problem from a different angle.)   It’s now more than 5 years later. Here’s the thing: the timeframes for achieving robotaxi capability presented at “We, Robot” are basically the same as the timeframes presented by Elon Musk  at a similar presentation in 2018  — relative to the time of the presentation. If it was only that, I’d take it up with Tesla management. The point is that millions of people have bought Teslas following these promises and based off of them, and I have a hard time believing anyone who bought a Tesla in the past 5 years is going to see their Tesla appreciate in value.",neutral,0.995

Still, many critics are skeptical Tesla can sell safe, driverless cars at scale due to the numerous state and federal safety regulations it faces over its current driver-assistance technology. In a post on X, a link to the event’s livestream is captioned: “[t]he future will be streamed live.” Here’s what to expect from Tesla’s robotaxi event: Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, speaks during a Starship update press conference, Feb. Like, if Tesla had really cracked fully self-driving cars, why not do this demonstration in downtown Austin, where they’re located, which is also choked with traffic, or downtown Los Angeles?” he tells ABC Audio. Instead of drivers, the cars will be autonomous, and what’s more, Tesla owners will be allowed to send their own cars off to collect fares when they’re not using their vehicles. In June, at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, dubbed “Cyber Roundup 2024,” Musk said that his vision for a driverless taxi service is similar to Uber, the ridesharing service, and AirBnB, the vacation rental app. “So, like, they’ll be some cars that Tesla owns itself, in kind of an Uber fashion. In a podcast interview earlier this year with venture capital investor Logan Bartlett, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed skepticism that a “Tesla owner or owner of any other car is going to want to have that car be ridden in by a complete stranger.” An employee drives a Tesla Motors Inc. First, the data collected from autonomous taxi rides could lay the groundwork for other projects he’s working on, such as the humanoid Tesla robot dubbed “Optimus.” In addition, Ives says, Musk is also aiming to create a durable revenue stream from rideshares so the company doesn’t have to rely on people buying new cars every year. It's about software, full self-driving, autonomous and ultimately their views from a data perspective that will ultimately drive robotics, Optimus, and other technology.” “That’s where he sees everything going, that’s what he thinks will turn Tesla into a multitrillion-dollar company, and I think power the many other ventures that he has running,” says George. Tesla’s Bumpy Autonomous Past Tesla currently offers semi-autonomous driving technology, called “Autopilot,” which can keep the car centered in its lane, as well as speed up and slow down with highway traffic. In addition, Tesla buyers can opt for the $8,000 “Full Self Driving” option, which is designed for lower speed urban driving. A Tesla all electric Model X is displayed during the British Motor Show 2024 at Farnborough International Exhibition Centre, Aug. NHTSA is also investigating whether a massive recall of nearly every Tesla ever made went far enough in addressing the safety of Autopilot. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about NHTSA's findings. “This all speaks to what a risky bet this is for Tesla,” says George. And they’ve got to deliver.” The financial stakes Earlier this month, Tesla posted better-than-expected third quarter earnings. Still, shares slumped on the news, as investors eye Tesla’s shrinking market share amid increasingly competitive electric vehicles from other automakers. George says that’s why the stakes are high for Tesla ahead of the robotaxi event. “It may also be possible that this is less about selling a product to future owners, and more about convincing Wall Street that he’s on the right track to keep Tesla’s stock price high,” says George, adding, “they’ve been kind of alluding to this as being right around the corner for 10 years now, and I think that more and more we’re starting to see that that check is due.” [ ]",positive,0.998

Elon Musk keeps telling investors and reporters that the company is not really a car company and focusing on it being a car company is stupid. Yesterday, Tesla  released its Q3 numbers  and they were  sort of the opposite of what the market had expected , which is probably why the stock is going up today. Here’s what I wrote yesterday:   Tesla will report its third-quarter financials later today and  the expectation  is that the company will remain profitable, albeit with lower margins due to the incentives being pushed to sell cars. While I suspect there are numerous factors that contributed to this, Tesla  laid off a ton of people this quarter . Is this related to the issue Tesla customers are having with service? You’d think this would mean that Tesla could be the first Western automaker to crack the $25,000 car, but Elon Musk doesn’t want to do that.

Bank of America’s John Murphy upped his price target on the back of Tesla’s strong quarter. Murphy was pleased to see auto gross margin strength, with Energy and Services (where Tesla sees sales doubling in 2025) tracking above estimates. Looking ahead, Murphy and BofA see a “well positioned” 2025, with a “second growth wave” on the horizon for Tesla. “The bottom-line [from positive commentary on the earnings call] was that Tesla is charging up for the next wave of growth,” Murphy said. This radical change is likely to be fueled by the expected production start of a more affordable vehicle in 1H25 (more likely 2H25) and the Cybercab.”       Murphy also noted that Tesla saw an uptick in full self-driving (FSD) adoption following the company's Oct. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas homed in on CEO Elon Musk’s prediction that Tesla volume growth could hit 20% to 30% in 2025, which Musk caveated as a “best guess.”   Musk’s target “clearly depends on the company's ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers, and improved features,” Jonas wrote in a note to investors. Jonas and the Morgan Stanley team see Tesla’s quarter as one that had investors focusing on lowering vehicle costs and growing the auto business profitability over trying to value Tesla’s shift to AI and other ventures. Tesla remains a “top pick” for Morgan Stanley, with a $310 price target. “Our view continues to be that Tesla is well positioned as a technology platform to leverage end-to-end AI into a leading position in autonomous driving and humanoid robotics,"" Yu wrote, reiterating the firm's Buy rating and $295 price target. One of the most bullish Tesla analysts on the street, Dan Ives, was very impressed with Tesla’s quarter, which he dubbed an “early Christmas present” for investors. “I think it's margins, margins, margins,” Ives told Yahoo Finance, with that being the main driver behind Tesla’s monster stock move today. “Look at their cost of goods, their ability to produce cars is down ultimately 30% to 40%, and could be down another 20%, 30% when you look at next year … What we've seen on margins, the renaissance of growth now is I think heading into 2025.”   Tesla and SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk at a political festival Atreju organized by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy right-wing party in Rome, Italy, Dec. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo)   ·   Reuters / Reuters Ives says that margin story merges with Tesla’s AI and autonomous offerings, as well as other growth drivers that will eventually lead to a trillion-dollar-plus market cap. They're checking every box.” Ives came away deeply impressed by the earnings conference call, claiming it was Musk and Tesla’s best in a number of years.

If you go to Amazon, you can find a selection of bumper stickers with messages like “I bought this before Elon went crazy,” “Shut Up, Elon,” “Anti-Elon Tesla Club,” and a few that we can’t print here because this is a family friendly place. Bai writes that many Tesla owners bought their cars in large part because they felt they were having a positive impact on the world. Even when  Musk  decided to waste a chunk of his fortune on buying Twitter, so that he could restore accounts belonging to right wing dissemblers such as Donald Trump and Alex Jones, Tesla lovers managed to feel pretty good about themselves. Among Bai’s friends who drive a Tesla, Musk’s name comes up a lot in conversation, like an embarrassing skin condition you wish you could ignore, he says. One woman he knows recently bought a Tesla Model 3, but knocked on doors for Harris twice last month. Has Tesla Lost Its Allure? Bai says he is now in the market for an electric car himself, and like many others, is conflicted about whether to get a Tesla. “If you already drive a Tesla, and someone gives you a hard time about it, tell them to keep it to themselves, or maybe just drive the car over their azaleas. If you’re thinking about trading in your Tesla for something less offensive to your values, or everybody else’s, I’d say don’t bother. “But if you are deciding whether to buy a Tesla, and you care about basic democratic values, then I think the choice is simple — don’t. If hate has no home in our communities, then neither does that brand new Tesla.”   A Matter Of Opinion   Bai’s opinion is just that — an opinion. Here is one I found rational and cogent:   “Let’s be clear: Tesla makes great cars. “I have been an active Tesla supporter for years, but no longer. I have the bumper sticker mentioned in the article, and I no longer recommend Tesla products to anyone (although, to be honest, most of my friends would not be caught dead buying a Tesla at this point). Power corrupts even those who start with the best intentions.”   Others suggested the Tesla board has egregiously failed to do its duty by letting Musk run amok and actually do damage to the company’s main goal — selling electric cars. My Tesla Model Y sat parked in the garage while I was away. When I went to get in it, it no longer recognized my cell phone and I had to use my Tesla key card to access the car. I called the Tesla help-line and a very courteous representative helped me reset my phone key. Shortly thereafter, I got a survey from Tesla asking me about my service experience. Then came the last question: “How likely are you to recommend Tesla?” On a scale of 0 to 10, I choose zero. Tesla fever was in the air. Tesla is now just another car company, one that is actually trailing several other electric car manufacturers when it comes to making cars people want at prices they can afford. Musk  is clearly bored with Tesla the car company, and is now fixated on censoring the opinions of anyone who doesn’t agree with him.",neutral,0.994

In our view, an autonomous taxi platform will unlock a multi-trillion dollar market and begin to dominate Tesla’s valuation, approaching ~90% of its enterprise value over the next five years. 1 How would Tesla’s robotaxi service work? Through over-the-air updates to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, Tesla estimates it will enable full autonomy in the US during the next year, as shown below. 2  Once the FSD update is live, ARK estimates Tesla could launch a robotaxi service in the next year or two. Even before full autonomy is achieved, Tesla could launch a human-driven ride-hail service, which would collect valuable data on routes, customer behavior, and operational dynamics while also informing its service infrastructure and building its customer base. When Will Tesla Achieve Full Autonomy? Tesla Estimate: “...based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that—to be far enough in excess of humans that  you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. do it next year.”  – Elon Musk, 7/23/24 3 Source: Tesla earnings call, July 23, 2024. Importantly, production of a low-cost Cybercab should not be a bottleneck for the launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service. Tesla’s full autonomy solution should be compatible with vehicles equipped with Hardware 3 and Hardware 4—about 6.5 million cars globally, with ~2.5 million cars in the US. In the long run, most of Tesla’s robotaxi fleet is likely to be owned and operated by third-party partners, with Tesla hosting the ride-hail platform itself and perhaps maintaining a small fleet of its own vehicles. The importance of Tesla’s ability to scale the fleet quickly should not be underestimated. 9 Like Waymo, Tesla is likely to launch its robotaxi service city by city; but unlike Waymo, it should be able to scale much faster, because it will not rely on HD maps or geofencing. Perhaps Tesla’s most important advantage over Waymo, however, is its data lake of real-world driving miles. According to ARK’s research, Tesla’s customer vehicles drive over 5 million miles per day in FSD, and over 87 million miles per day when including US-only non-FSD miles, generating valuable video clips for Tesla to train its autonomous software. Waymo’s fleet size and the limited driving conditions of the few cities in which it operates likely have restricted its access to real-world “corner cases.” In contrast, Tesla’s fleet has been collecting diverse camera data from all over the US. Additionally, thanks to its vertically integrated production, Tesla has a clear path to scaling its robotaxi fleet, while Waymo must rely on Zeekr. 15  Tesla’s Model 3 costs $40,000, sensors included. 16  While it needs to build backend support for remote vehicle assistance and customer support, Tesla should be able to leverage its existing factory, charging, and service infrastructure to scale efficiently. 18 Moreover, its vast data library should help Tesla prove its safety benefits to regulators. Last year, Tesla’s data already had demonstrated that its FSD-equipped cars were ~5x safer from accidents than its cars without FSD and ~16x safer than the average car, adjusting for city street driving. Notably, even without full autonomy, a human-driven ride-hail service hosted by Tesla could undercut today’s ride-hail rates, as the operating cost of an electric vehicle is roughly one third that of a gas-powered car. Thanks to its lower cost structure and the price umbrella provided by traditional ride-hail services, we believe Tesla could command a take rate more than double the ~30% that of Uber. 22  Targeting a total available market (TAM) much greater than Uber had envisioned, Tesla also is tackling the largest applied AI project on earth, one that could save more than 40,000 lives in the US and ~1.2 million globally per year.",neutral,0.994

What seems more clear after Tesla’s latest earnings report is that for now, Tesla is primarily a car company, and the more successful a car company it is, the more runway investors will give it to transform. The numbers help tell the story: Tesla’s automotive revenue was $20.02 billion last quarter, a full 79% of the total. It also sent Tesla shares back into the green for the year after what’s been a bumpy road. Even Tesla bulls like Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley were nonplussed at the lack of specific details for the company’s robotaxis and cybervans, and they raised eyebrows at demo robots that were reportedly remote-controlled rather than governed by AI. In this case, Tesla’s profitability improved in part due to a focus on cutting the cost to make vehicles.",positive,0.996

According to Tesla's  website , ""The currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

On Wednesday, LatinoJustice and the National Institute for Workers’ Rights sent a letter to State Controller Malia Cohen pushing for the California Public Employees’ Retirement System to get rid of its Tesla holdings, arguing that the company’s values are “misaligned,” and that Musk’s claims that promoting diversity is  as morally wrong as racism  is “indefensible.” Cohen is a board member of CalPERS, which had $530 billion in assets as of Tuesday. California’s public sector workforce is incredibly diverse, with 60% of civil service employees in the state being non-white.”     The letter also cited  Tesla’s $3.2 million March settlement  to a Black former employee who accused the company of racial discrimination as an example of its “troubling values.” The settlement came a month after Tesla dropped prior language from its regulatory filings that supported  employee resource groups and fostering diversity . … CalPERS believes that the employees of every company in which we invest have the right to a safe and healthy work environment, one in which their fundamental human rights are respected.”     In June CalPERS  voted against  a $46 billion compensation package that Tesla  ultimately rewarded Musk , calling it “exorbitant,” while agreeing that Musk “is entitled to be well compensated for his work.”   But pushing for the pension fund to divest is a tall ask: CalPERS is  one of Tesla’s top shareholders .

Now, the cheapest Tesla car is the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, priced at $42,490. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush and a longtime Tesla bull, told Business Insider that the discontinuation is ""a smart strategic move"" signaling a greater focus on the Long Range Model 3. ""The tariffs on Chinese EVs speak to more tension in the US-China Cold Tech War that benefits Tesla,"" Ives said. He also said that removing the Standard Range model doesn't significantly impact Tesla's overall strategy because the Model Y remains the company's main focus in the US EV market. Most EV options, including Tesla's, remain more  expensive  than the average gas-powered car. Tesla has long talked about building a  cheaper car than the Model 3 , but it has yet to bring one to the market. Tesla's decision to discontinue the cheapest version of its Model 3 came just as the company slightly  beat  analysts' delivery  expectations , with third-quarter sales rising to 462,890 vehicles. Ives told BI that Tesla's sales were ""a step in the right direction"" to meet its yearly target of 1.8 million vehicle deliveries. Bargain Chinese EVs Adding to the price war are  Chinese competitors  like Xpeng, which recently launched the Mona M03 at $16,800 — less than half the price of Tesla's Model 3 in China.

Through the Model S and subsequent products, Tesla has innovated and challenged industry conventions on numerous fronts, including over-the-air updates, self-driving technology, and automotive construction methods. Tesla is considered the world's most valuable car brand as of 2023, and the  Model Y the world's best-selling car  in the same year, but the brand's greatest achievement is arguably the Supercharger network of EV charging stations. Related     The Tesla Model 3 Project Highland brings fresh upgrades, but not all changes are for the better.

While most don’t expect a fully functional robotaxi that can be deployed right away, it’s what CEO Elon Musk and Tesla can do to paint a picture of autonomous self-driving that the company envisions for the next five or 10 years down the road that matters. Possible  leaks have already surfaced  suggesting Tesla may strike a robo-delivery deal with DoorDash, for instance. (Yahoo Finance could not verify those reports.)   Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who named Tesla his “top pick” in the autos space, has nonetheless advised clients to “keep expectations well managed” for the event. A demonstration of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised. (Tesla YouTube channel)   ·   Tesla YouTube channel   “It is our expectation that Tesla will offer a 'dual' approach with respect to autonomous ridesharing: (1) the fully autonomous app-based cybercab and (2) a 'supervised' autonomous/FSD rideshare service. While the cybercab — a vehicle envisioned as one without a steering wheel or pedals — may be the natural fit for a robotaxi, Jonas believes it is the preexisting fleet of Teslas out on the road that, when combined with FSD and Tesla’s upcoming rideshare mobility app, will allow owners of those Tesla EVs to put those vehicles on Tesla’s rideshare service. A Tesla deal with DoorDash to deliver restaurant takeout could easily be envisioned as part of this service. Jonas and Morgan Stanley have an Overweight rating and a $310 price target on Tesla heading into the event. Other analysts believe that the cybercab unveiled could actually be the model or basis for a new Tesla passenger vehicle, the long-promised  “next-gen” vehicle . 10, we expect an unveiling of the ‘CyberCab’ at the venue, [and] some type of robotaxi demo … Moreover, Tesla should unveil the new lower cost vehicle slated for SOP [start of production] next year (“Model 2” or cheaper/smaller Model 3 variant),” Deutsche Bank’s Edison Yu wrote in a note. Story Continues   Yu is referring to the sub-$30K next-gen EV Tesla confirmed would be coming later this year, one that would open up new buyers to the Tesla universe. Tesla's product roadmap from 2024 shareholder meeting presentation (Tesla)   ·   Tesla Yu, who has a Buy rating and a $295 price target on Tesla, is also advising clients to be “tactically cautious” on the event, as the bar for wowing the Street is high and the likelihood of a “sell the news” type of reaction is possible. Garrett Nelson of CFRA also believes that a cheaper Tesla EV will be coming alongside the cybercab. While he thinks Tesla plans to create a robotaxi fleet harnessing the cybercab and other Tesla EVs powered by FSD software, he is skeptical of how realistic timing will be for this venture. Tesla's preview of the ride-hailing feature coming to Tesla's App. (Tesla)   ·   Tesla Nelson believes Tesla “remains far from achieving a level of autonomy” that would include capabilities like performing all safety-critical driving functions and monitoring road conditions for an entire trip. Nelson, who has a Hold rating and $240 price target on Tesla, believes the key question for Tesla’s bull case is whether or not investors will give the company a pass on near- and intermediate-term issues, such as softer EV sales, and continue to focus more on longer-term opportunities like autonomous driving and robotaxi deployment. Finally, in a note published late last week, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Thursday’s event will put Tesla’s long-term vision on full display. While Ives and other analysts believe Tesla will showcase the cybercab, its next-gen platform, and FSD and AI updates, Ives predicts Musk will also address the “near-term pain points” seen by investors for self-driving and how the company will overcome them. Ives added that Tesla, for which Wedbush has an Outperform rating and bullish $300 price target, is going through another transformation not seen since the company's volume Model 3 and Y release, with the next phase focused on AI, FSD, and supercomputing. “We firmly believe that Tesla remains a robotics/AI play in the future rather than just an EV vendor,” Ives said. “We believe this is a pivotal time for Tesla as the company prepares to release its years of Robotaxi R&D shadowed behind the curtains, while Musk & Co.",neutral,0.994

Illustration by Hayden Maynard   According to a spokesperson from Uber, seeing Teslas everywhere isn’t just some figment of my imagination (or, as Tesla’s diabolical overlord/CEO might put it, a glitch in the simulation we all live in). Tesla is luring them into its cars by partnering with Uber to give drivers vehicle ownership offers: $2,000 in additional incentives for buying and completing trips. So maybe I’ll just say that the Zero Emissions Incentive lets EV drivers earn up to $5,000 extra a year, on top of the government’s Incentives for Zero Emissions program, which also offers up to $5,000 for a Tesla purchase or lease.",neutral,0.996

This is a question we get asked many times as we demonstrate our Tesla Model 3 at EV events and motor shows  throughout Queensland, Australia . Prompted by an email from a fellow Tesla owner, I thought it might be worth a tongue-in-cheek article for  CleanTechnica  in these most serious of times. That is resale value as a vehicle be it parts or just 2nd hand.” If you have the IQ to tackle a Tesla, you could probably get an easier and higher paying job. “Tesla vehicles are  rarely stolen  due to their advanced security features, high-tech connectivity, and low demand for parts. With a Tesla you would have to be so incredibly good with coding/hacking that stealing a Tesla would be such a poor use of your talents.”   I know a little about the anti-theft capabilities of my 2019 Tesla Model 3, but very little about such features on other EVs, so I reached out to some of the many Facebook communities dedicated to electric vehicles in Australia. Some implored me not to write an article on how to steal an EV, as thieves might make it a challenge event (Tesla already does that for hackers). Others told me funny stories of mistaken identity: “They had tried to ‘steal’ someone else’s Tesla in a case of mistaken identity in a multi-level parking lot.” I have made the same mistake myself — finding Tess. There’s also the story where a would-be thief tried to drop the battery out of a Tesla in the Brisbane Airport long-term parking and ended up in dire need of assistance as the damaged battery resting on some of his more delicate body parts moved into thermal runaway. My Tesla was ordered in April 2016 and delivered in September 2019. I had plenty of time to read articles and watch videos as the Tesla Model 3 spread across the United States. Tesla, in response, installed Sentry mode to make use of the already existing cameras to record such behaviour. Sadly, Tesla had to change the face of Sentry mode. Then came the appeals from police for Tesla owners to supply vision taken by the cars to identify perpetrators of more serious crimes. Tesla owners had moved from being “virtue signalling wankers” (as my brother in law called me) to being a “caped crusader”…“To the bat cave Robyn, we need to recharge!”   While we waited patiently for our delivery, our car was getting better. After we had mastered them, under instruction from the Tesla technician, then came the tasks of teaching our friends, neighbours and family. “You push in the fat bit, then pull on the skinny bit.” Of course, ours being an older Fremont Tesla 3, they couldn’t work out how to exit the car either. The layers of security on a Tesla are quite intricate. The most famous Tesla theft in Australia is that of Nick Kyrgios’ lime green Model X. The takeaway is that, with Tesla, the future is bright, electric, and very secure!",positive,0.997

The Model S put Tesla on the map as a serious contender; it set the template for the high-end electric sedan and influenced virtually all of the lesser Tesla models that followed. The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   You might already know this, but today I learned that the Model S is  still  being sold as Tesla’s largest and most prestigious non-truck product. Tesla   I’ve seen renderings of what illustrators think the next-generation Model S will look like; none are showing The Next Big Thing. Some are portraying it as the yet-to-be-released Tesla Roadster stretched out to the proportions of a sedan with cutouts for four doors. If nothing else, Tesla as a brand needs its products to be cutting edge (even to a fault), and playing me-too won’t do it any favors. Seriously, offer me a Taycan and a look-alike Tesla at the same price and why wouldn’t I just get the Porsche? For everyone infatuated with the Tesla pickup design’s embracing of once-popular straight lines, there are two (or three really) that can’t stand these “sharp-edged cars”. Tesla   Sadly, they’re basing their hatred of the return of the “folded paper” school of design on the Cybertruck, which frankly isn’t a shining example of the genre. Tesla   What makes the Cybertruck so unappealing to me, and many others as well? The ones on the Tesla pickup could be made from Home Depot rain gutter material:   SportscarMarket   While I more than welcome the return of sharp-edged cars, using edges so sharp that you literally cut yourself is not the way to go. Can’t Tesla redeem itself by giving us something that does justice to angular cars while still separating themselves from the pack with a nearly timeless design? Hyundai   Regardless, Hyundai has already embraced this aesthetic with their new, original designs like the IONIQ 5:     Hyundai   Truth be told, with Tesla sedans starting to look old hat and their pickup bearing a strong resemblance to a plywood prop in a low-budget  Battlestar Galactica  rip-off, Hyundai is doing a far better job at creating cars that look like “the future.”   As the greatest influencers of this angular style, Ital Design are now actually getting into the revival themselves. VIDEO       Sadly, you just know that Audi isn’t going to bite on a design that has none of their current brand language as a production car, but I know one company that should: Tesla. Ital Design   What if we took that Ital Design Audi revival and stretched it a bit to be like the Medici to fit our requirements for the next generation Tesla Model S? With the disappearance of sedans in general, one wonders if there even will be a next-generation Tesla Model S. I hope there will be, and if so, my guess is that it will set the tone for the aesthetics of more entry-level Tesla cars for years to come. Let’s face it: other than Cybertruck, all of Tesla’s cars are essentially the same thing just squeezed down (the Model 3) or pulled up (Model X) or squeezed  and  pulled (Model Y). Ital Design   To work as a five-door luxury hatch, I first need to raise the height slightly, increase the length through both the wheelbase and rear overhang:   Ital Design, Tesla   The dramatic black hood and wheel arch tops of the Audi will need to go away, but I’ve kept the wedge shape with the side windows culminating in a parallelogram-shaped area for the mirrors.",neutral,0.995

While further testing is ongoing, city officials currently believe based on Tesla’s reporting that the company released about 12 gallons of the substance, which is used to cool its AI supercomputer, into the storm drain. But the city is still working to  determine whether to fine Tesla  for storing sodium hydroxide without a permit. Jonathan Brown, who lives on Fernando Avenue in Ventura, lauded the Fire Department for its quick response but wondered whether the city is too reliant on Tesla’s word.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) deliveries in China slipped last month, as exports from its Shanghai plant increased. Tesla China sold 68,280 vehicles in October, including 27,795 exported, data released today by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed. In the January-October period, Tesla sold 500,685 vehicles in China, surpassing the 500,000-unit mark, up 8.29 percent from a year earlier. Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, both for deliveries to local customers and as an export hub for it. Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half, it previously said. October marked the start of the fourth quarter, which saw Tesla dedicate more vehicles to exports. Notably, Tesla China's overall sales in October that included exports were down 5.32 percent from 72,115 in the same month last year, and down 22.69 percent from 88,321 vehicles in September. Exports from Tesla's Shanghai plant in October decreased 36.09 percent from 43,489 in the same month last year but increased 72.41 percent from 16,121 in September. Of Tesla China's October sales including exports, Model Y was 42,265 units, contributing 61.90 percent of sales. Model 3 sales, including exports, amounted to 26,015 units, contributing to 38.10 percent of Tesla China's October sales. This means that Tesla's share of the Chinese NEV market was 3.39 percent in October, down from 6.43 percent in September and down from 3.73 percent a year earlier, CnEVPost calculations show. In China's BEV market, Tesla's share was 6.02 percent in October, down from 11.21 percent in September, but up from 5.78 percent a year earlier.

And Tesla wants them to end Take it from the CEO himself. Tesla has a dominant position over EV automakers in the US, and removing the credit would further entrench that lead by hammering the competition. In a July earnings call, Musk said the credit removal would be “devastating” for Tesla’s rivals but only hurt it “slightly.” Tesla sells its EVs at a sizeable profit, while competitors like Ford and GM lose money on every EV they sell. Making EV production less economical would dent Tesla’s margins but could force its legacy automaker peers to stop churning out EV models entirely (even with the tax credit in place, Ford idled production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup through the end of the year).",neutral,0.996

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas. The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. 17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained. He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. 17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive. 17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has",positive,0.998

Tesla API pricing could destroy many third party apps - Mashable,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5pbTFPV2FneWZlcHFINi1fYVNoRzB1N2pyeDFvaVVVNU53RzczdExBVHlHLXQ0NHdWb29nOWJLdzlxOVdzRXg1TjF3MXg1ekRaM0dSSjgzR09RZw?oc=5,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla's   API pricing is live , and the news is not good for third party app developers. Streaming vehicle signals to the app, for example, cost $1 per 150,000 signals; performing commands on a Tesla device costs $1 per 1,000 requests; polling a limited set of data from the vehicle costs $1 per 500 requests, and waking up the vehicle from sleep costs $1 per 50 requests. Tesla  got an official API  (application programming interface) in October 2023 after years of developers having to rely on an unofficial API. Credit: Tesla       This can be hard to put into perspective if you're a regular user, but for some third-party app developers, these prices are a deal breaker. Tessie is an app that offers a comprehensive set of information on your Tesla car, such as real-world range, battery health, and charging times. The Tessie developer said they plan to circumvent this by using ""direct car communication over IP and BLE,"" which will require a ""wild amount of effort."" Tyler Corsair, founder of another popular Tesla app  Teslascope , also voiced his opinion in the same Reddit thread. To provide the same frequency of data would cost Teslascope 7.5x its monthly revenue.""   And the developer of another third party app,  Teslemetry , said it would cost him ""25x revenue at this point."" Tesla does not provide a way for the media to send inquiries, so we can't ask about the reasoning behind these rates. With this move, Tesla appears to be going the same path as  X (ex-Twitter) , and  Reddit , which put a lot of developers out of business when they drastically increased API pricing for third party apps.",positive,0.989

The post includes two images showing Musk next to what appears to be Tesla cars. 19, PolitiFact found no evidence that Musk is releasing a solar-powered Tesla. Tesla  uses  lithium-ion batteries, not solar panels, in the electric cars it makes. Tesla also doesn’t have a vehicle that costs $7,000; the cheapest car on its website goes for  almost $30,000 . The article said that Paul Dastoor, a physics professor at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, would use 18 specially-designed solar panels to power a Tesla for a trip around Australia. Musk said the car will need to unfold the solar panels like a Starlink satellite, but that ""you just don’t have enough surface area for it.""   Host Joe Rogan then  asked  Musk: ""But it's never going to get to a point where you can just have a car that's made out of solar panels that it could drive around, it could never be that efficient?"" Musk said: ""Correct, so you do not have enough surface area.""   We also searched Tesla's website, and the only solar-related products are  solar panels  and  solar roofs .

Several hundred stickers a day are now being sold, primarily to Tesla owners, Hiller said, bearing texts such as “Anti Elon Tesla Club” or “I Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy”, or a picture of Musk in clown makeup with the words “Space Clown”. Musk, who has an estimated  wealth  of $314bn, was once considered an environmental hero and technology pioneer by many US liberals after turning Tesla into the most  valuable  car company in the world while warning that “climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI”. Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Some Tesla owners have been left horrified. It’s scary for someone with that sort of money to be so close to a politician,” said Mika Houston, a gymnastics teacher in Las Vegas who has had a Tesla Model 3 for the past three years. I’m embarrassed driving this car around after the election, thinking about the man behind it,” said Houston, who has bought an “Anti Elon Tesla Club” magnet for her car and is mulling whether to sell it. Pamela Perkins, a photographer who lives in the Tesla heartland of California’s Silicon Valley, has a Model Y but is among a group of friends who are all considering ditching their Teslas. “There was a time I thought  Elon Musk  was a genius but he went bad very quickly. “A lot of people have asked if I’m going to sell the car, I have a friend who was about to get a Tesla but decided not to because of him. He wants to colonize Mars.” It’s unclear whether this backlash against Musk will hurt Tesla, which remains the dominant electric car company in the US. Sales have struggled somewhat this year, with a 7% drop  forecast  in the latest quarter compared with the same period in 2023, although analysts put this down to increased competition from other car makers and a stale Tesla lineup that has little changed apart from the  much-hyped Cybertruck . “Tesla isn’t the only player in town now and they haven’t been aggressive in putting new products out,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. “Elon is Tesla: his persona definitely has an impact upon the perception of the brand, and he has been polarizing. I do think this will happen, but it remains to be seen which consumers he attracts and which he loses.” Another uncertainty is how Tesla will be affected by policies pursued by Trump. Davis, who has a Tesla, said she has had an 800% increase in sales of these bumper stickers on Etsy since the election.",neutral,0.993

While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage.

I "" picked this car up on Oct 30th, on Nov 3rd it was dead in my garage, unresponsive to anything ,"" wrote Elan on the  Tesla Cybertruck Owners  group on Facebook. Thus, I had it towed to Tesla service center. ""   Fast forward to yesterday November 13th, and there's news that  Tesla has announced a recall for the Cybertruck  - the sixth this year, but this one feels particularly relevant. VIDEO       But late last night Elan, gave the group members a new update that Tesla mechanics finally called. Tesla said they will work on it tomorrow (meaning today) and hopefully, the car will be ready Friday. ""   Elan’s experience has drawn significant attention from other Tesla owners, as it coincides with Tesla’s recent Cybertruck recall addressing power and connectivity concerns that could cause unresponsiveness. One of them says this is a Lemon Law, another says give Tesla a chance to marke it right, to which I agree, and yet others share their own experiences with the Cybertruck. Yet, Tesla was trying to make it right. I think Tesla’s identification of the Power Conversion System issue could be a step toward remedying the Cybertruck’s initial reliability concerns, especially as other owners report similar early-stage hiccups. so holding my breath.” His case underscores the challenges of adopting brand-new models but also highlights Tesla’s commitment to resolving these issues in real-time. Tesla’s response to these issues will be a critical factor in shaping carbuyer trust. With more owners sharing similar experiences, many are watching closely to see how effectively Tesla can address these initial Cybertruck reliability hurdles. And Tesla seems to be trying to make it right. He has more than a decade of expertise in the automotive industry with a special interest in Tesla and electric vehicles.

The agency’s investigation, which began in October, covers 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the FSD system following reports of four crashes, including a fatality in 2023, where conditions like sun glare, fog, and airborne dust may have contributed to the incidents. The NHTSA raises concerns about Tesla’s promotional materials, including posts on the social media platform  X , formerly known as Twitter. NHTSA argued that these posts conflict with Tesla’s stated messaging that FSD requires driver oversight and intervention. In a letter sent to Tesla in May, NHTSA expressed its concerns about the posts and asked the automaker to reconsider how it communicates the capabilities of its driver-assistance systems. Tesla responded by reiterating that its owner’s manual and other materials clearly state that FSD is not autonomous and requires driver vigilance. As part of its ongoing investigation, NHTSA has set a deadline of December 18 for Tesla to answer questions related to the system’s performance, especially in conditions with reduced roadway visibility. The agency is examining whether Tesla’s system provides adequate feedback to drivers, enabling them to make real-time decisions about when the system’s capabilities have been exceeded. A Tesla operating in FSD mode struck her. At the time, the driver of the Tesla struggled with sun glare and has not faced any charges in the incident. In December 2023, Tesla agreed to recall more than 2 million vehicles in the U.S. However, the agency is still evaluating whether these safeguards are sufficient to address the ongoing safety concerns associated with Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance systems.",positive,0.995

Tesla Excluded From EV Buyer Credits in California Proposal - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQRVBhaUE5MENVN0NyemhWcmNoZDdudzgzV2FfQVFlUUl6OVdOUE1Id3d2TFIzYmc1aHMxQnhOdFFEWVQxOHNfdkpycTRvcnp5S1hlTU9wWlpBQ2RmLWFXaU5HOHlkVUFfbnBZQUVaRV91YjNjVG52ckVpVTZrQWtQYXROOGtuV1U?oc=5,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicles would be shut out from consumer rebates under a proposal by California Governor Gavin Newsom, pitting the prospective Democratic presidential hopeful against Republican power player Elon Musk. His office told Bloomberg News that the current proposal includes market-share limitations that would exclude Tesla’s popular EV models. The details — including Tesla’s possible omission from the credits — will be negotiated with the state legislature and could change, Newsom’s office said. Musk, Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer, posted on his X social-media platform that the proposal was “insane,” citing the automaker’s manufacturing presence in the state. The move would leave market-leading Tesla out of a key incentive program aimed at spurring wider adoption of EVs at a time of slowing growth for all-electric vehicles. Tesla’s models do qualify for the federal credit, which was introduced as part of President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. Excluding Tesla could burnish Newsom’s standing on the left as he renews a clash with Musk, who has become a member of Trump’s inner circle and accepted a role helping the incoming administration cut government spending. “This is a slap in Tesla’s face,” Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, said of the California proposal. California Tension   Tensions between Musk and Newsom have been strained for years, with the Tesla leader moving the automaker’s headquarters to Texas in 2021, in part citing frustration with California’s politics. Musk had angrily denounced state orders to close Tesla’s Fremont factory during the Covid-19 pandemic, labeling them “fascist” in an earnings call. When Musk announced the headquarters move, Newsom said Tesla owed some of its success to California. Tesla still accounts for more than half of all new EVs sold in California, but its grip on the market is slipping. Tesla’s sales in California fell 12.6% during the first three quarters compared with a year earlier, even as overall electric-vehicle sales in the state rose 1%, according to the California New Car Dealers Association. Tesla made 54.5% of all EVs registered in the state during the first three quarters, a significant drop from 63% during the same period last year.

Better Q3 earnings and deliveries, and the promise of Tesla’s robotaxi Cybercab testing in earnest next year, have fueled optimism, even before this week’s Trump-inspired stock rally. While Musk is in charge of companies like SpaceX (which includes Starlink) and X (formerly Twitter), Tesla investors have the most to gain — or lose — from Musk's ties to Trump. Threats of rolling back EV tax credits by a Trump White House and GOP-led Congress were thought of as headwinds to the Tesla volume growth story.

""We believe a Trump win could add $40-$50 per share to Tesla's stock,"" Ives added, noting that the company could exceed $1 trillion in market cap ""if autonomous/FSD is accelerated starting in 2025.""   Beyond Tesla, because of Musk’s support of his candidacy, Trump has even promised Musk a position in his administration, suggesting  Musk could head a commission  to boost government efficiency.

Tesla’s increased focus on leasing responds to a decline in both global and U.S. While CEO Elon Musk previously indicated that Tesla would surpass 1.8 million global deliveries, global sales fell by 2.3% in the first three quarters of 2024, with U.S. To strengthen its leasing program, Tesla introduced lease buyouts for the Model 3 and Model Y in November 2024, driven by consumer demand for flexibility. This option contrasts with Tesla’s earlier policy of requiring buyers to return leased vehicles at the end of their terms. The buyout option now applies across all Tesla models, including the  Cybertruck , which began leasing at $999 per month. The Tesla Model 3 notably experienced the steepest value drop, highlighting risks as Tesla expands its leasing program.

A federal judge this week ruled that Musk's $50 billion pay package from Tesla cannot be reinstated. Allison Robbert-Pool/Getty Images                                         hide caption       toggle caption                       Allison Robbert-Pool/Getty Images                     A judge has again rejected a more than $50 billion compensation package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, granting a victory to the shareholder who opposed the pay amount. This started in 2018   Monday's decision was just the latest twist in a long-running saga over Musk's pay at Tesla. It's a legal fight that dates back to 2018, when Tesla shareholders  approved  a 10-year performance-based pay package for Musk. The compensation package was set up as a series of 12 milestones, each unlocking more compensation as Tesla continued to grow. Under the plan, Musk wouldn't earn a salary, but would instead receive additional Tesla shares the more the company grew. At the time, many thought it was absurd that Musk would ever hit the targets spelled out in the plan, as the package effectively required Musk to supercharge Tesla's valuation more than 10 times over. Still, the plan drew pushback from at least some Tesla shareholders, including Richard Tornetta, who objected to the compensation package and filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla in 2018. Lawyers for Tornetta on Monday praised McCormick's decision and said the ruling ""declined Tesla's invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings.""   Why so much money? According to the compensation plan that was announced in 2018, in order for Musk to meet the first milestone, Tesla's market cap had to go up to $100 billion. ""For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion,"" the company said. But Tesla has also grown significantly. In her opinion, McCormick called the process leading to the plan's approval ""deeply flawed,"" citing Musk's role as a controlling shareholder at Tesla as a potential conflict of interest. What the judge says about why she has struck down the pay package   Hoping to sway the judge, Tesla's board took the pay package back to shareholders for a second time this past  June  — winning that vote with a whopping 72% majority. Not only did McCormick strike down the compensation plan for a second time on Monday, she awarded Tornetta $345 million for legal fees that can be paid with either cash or Tesla shares. Plaintiffs had asked for $5.6 billion, but the judge called that a ""bold ask.""   McCormick has invited Tesla to create a new package for Musk, but the June vote did not represent a new plan, but rather ratification of the original agreement. Attorney's for Musk did not respond to a request for comment, but  writing on X , the social media platform he owns, Musk said, ""shareholders should control company votes, not judges.""   Tesla also called the court's decision ""wrong"" in a post on X and said it would appeal. Attorneys for the Tesla shareholders who opposed Musk's pay said they would defend the court's ""thoughtful and well-grounded opinions"" if the ruling is appealed.",positive,0.997

Don't hold your breath for the name, but a cheaper Tesla is, apparently, coming. The report claims that the car – codenamed ""Redwood"" – will be 15 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than Tesla's Model 3, and that it will cost Tesla about half as much to manufacture. She does confirm that Axelrod discussed the new Tesla with Deutsche Bank (Model Q seems to be Deutsche Bank's name for the car, not Tesla's). She also claims that the new car will be built on Tesla's existing production lines, and that it will cost less than $30,000 with subsidies (meaning that the actual starting price would be $37,499). But Peterson says that the report does not contain any details about the car's size, cost, or that it will built on Redwood, which is Tesla's internal code name for a mass market vehicle built on a new platform which was paused by Musk earlier in 2024. When laid out like this, the report doesn't really bring much new to the table, given that Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said a  cheaper Tesla is coming in the first half of 2025 , without revealing any additional details. Musk also specifically said that a non-Robotaxi Tesla car that costs $25,000 will not happen. Despite Musk's own AI Grok already  claiming  that Tesla has ""announced the upcoming launch of the Model Q,"" nothing new has been officially announced. Yes, a more affordable Tesla seems to be coming next year, but it's unclear whether it'll be an entirely new model or just a cheaper Model 3.",positive,0.998

The USD 25,000 Tesla EV might no longer be happening, in what would arguably be the biggest U-turn from the world’s most prominent electric carmaker. Rumored to be called ‘Tesla Model 2’ or ‘Tesla Model Q,’ the entry-level compact EV is said to be canceled from the pipeline. However, recent developments indicate the Tesla Model Q could still be on the cards, but in a slightly higher price band. It was back in August 2018 when Tesla first started saying it could launch a USD 25,000 car. In an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee (MKBHD), co-founder and CEO Elon Musk said (via  YouTube ), “I think in order for us to get to like, let’s say, ultimately getting like a USD 25,000 car, that’s something we could do.”   On various occasions since, Tesla indicated it would launch a USD 25,000 EV, and a driverless variant of the same. The latter, initially referred to as ‘Tesla Robotaxi,’ broke cover as the ‘Tesla Cybercab’ two-door, two-seat coupe in October 2024. Rendering artist Sugarchow shows how the Tesla Model 2/Model Q would look like if it was a compact hatchback. Image Source: Instagram/sugardesign_1   On March 1, 2023, Tesla announced it would manufacture its next-gen vehicle at a new plant in Mexico, and it was widely anticipated that this referred to the USD 25,000 EV. According to a follow-up report  Reuters  released on November 6, 2023, Tesla was going to make this EV at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg as well. On April 5, 2024,  Reuters  published another exclusive claiming that Tesla had scrapped the manually-driven USD 25,000 EV and plans to launch only its fully autonomous variant (Tesla Cybercab). Elon Musk, co-founder and CEO, Tesla (Tesla Q3 2024 earnings conference call on October 23, 2024)   The Tesla Cybercab is envisioned as a fully autonomous two-door coupe designed to carry two passengers without a driver. Image Source: Tesla   Tesla plans to build the Cybercab in two factories and aims to make at least two million units of the self-driving EV annually. Sub-30k Tesla Model Q to arrive in 2025? On December 9, 2024, citing a Deutsche Bank report, The Wall Street Journal reporter Becky Peterson said on  X  that Tesla plans to launch a Model Q in the first half of 2025. Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations at Tesla, reportedly met with Deutsche Bank for its Autonomous Driving Day on December 5, 2024, in New York City, where the product was discussed. Citing the report, Peterson added that Tesla would make the entry-level car at a current factory on an existing production line.

Here are 8 big changes that we expect in the  2025 Tesla Model Y (codename: Tesla Juniper) :   Sharper Styling   In line with Tesla’s new design language, seen on the  Cybertruck  and  Cybercab , the Model Y would adopt an edgier look. New Colors   Tesla will likely offer at least two new paint options for the Model Y Juniper, possibly the  Ultra Red  and  Stealth Gray  shades, borrowed from the  new Model 3 ‘s palette. New ‘Screens’   Tesla is likely to replace the Model Y’s 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system with a 15.4-inch unit in the upcoming refresh. New Motors   According to the Notebookcheck report, Tesla will employ its all-new, fourth-generation electric motors which are compact and more efficient than the current powertrain. Upgraded Battery   The facelifted Tesla Model Y will have a bigger, 95 kWh battery pack in the Long Range and Performance variants, as per the same Notebookcheck report. Long-wheelbase Variant   On August 29, 2024, Chinese publication  LatePost  reported that Tesla will offer the new Model Y in China in a three-row configuration, likely from Q4 2025 (October-December 2025).

Top Cars with Highest Fatality Rates   The top car models identified in the study include:       Hyundai Venue : 13.9 fatalities per billion miles ( 4.9 times the industry average )   Chevrolet Corvette : 13.6 ( 4.8 times the industry average )   Mitsubishi Mirage : 13.6 ( 4.8 times the industry average )   Porsche 911 : 13.2 ( 4.6 times the industry average )   Honda CR-V Hybrid : 13.2 ( 4.6 times the industry average )     According to iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer, Tesla’s elevated fatality rates might reflect driver behavior more than vehicle design. Many vehicles on the list, including Tesla models, perform exceptionally in crash tests conducted by the  IIHS  and  NHTSA , suggesting they are not inherently unsafe. Subcompact and compact vehicles, including Tesla’s smaller models, dominate the fatality list, whereas midsize and full-size cars generally fall below the industry average. For Tesla’s Model Y, it ranks third at 10.6 fatalities per billion miles, trailing only:     Hyundai Venue: 13.9 fatalities ( 6.3 times the industry SUV average )   Honda CR-V Hybrid: 13.2 ( 5.9 times the industry SUV average )   Buick Encore GX (9.8  times the industry SUV average )   Buick Envision (8.0  times the industry SUV average )     This data reminds auto dealers and manufacturers to consider not only vehicle safety design but also driver education and behavior. For Tesla and others, addressing misconceptions about Autopilot’s capabilities and promoting responsible usage could mitigate risks.",neutral,0.642

Musk and Tesla, she said, “have no procedural ground for flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.”   McCormick also awarded a record $345 million in fees to the prevailing plaintiffs’ counsel. The attorneys had sought fees in Tesla shares that amounted to 10% of the pay package, which would have resulted in compensation for the legal work equal to about $5.6 billion. This time around, McCormick was responding to a motion by Musk and Tesla to review that earlier decision in light of the  shareholder vote  the company held on the pay package in June to ratify it. Tesla made the request in part under a Chancery Court rule that allows a court to reopen the trial record after a post-trial decision, but that rule is for the introduction of newly discovered evidence, not newly created evidence. “Defendants created it after the Post-Trial Opinion.”   Second, Tesla’s effort to present the shareholder vote as common-law ratification came too late, she said. Third, Tesla failed to follow the procedural steps that might have allowed the vote to have legal weight as a form of “common law ratification.” For the vote to have had legal weight, the company would have had to set it up under what’s known as the MFW doctrine, which governs procedures for dealing with a conflicted-controller transaction.

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Elon Musk takes the stage. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. 16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated. 16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. 16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. 16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy. He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. 16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. 16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team. 16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas. The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. 17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained. He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. 17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended. Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. 17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck. Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together.

The EV world lit up with speculation  yesterday after reports emerged from China stating that Tesla , and specifically its Head of Investor Relations, Travis Axelrod, had confirmed plans for a new lower-cost EV set to debut next year during a Deutsche Bank meeting in NYC on Monday. While the report offers some clarity on Tesla’s ambitions, it stops short of providing concrete details, leaving plenty of room for speculation about what’s to come. Future Cars:  Everything We Know About The 2026 Tesla Model Y ‘Juniper’   According to the Deutsche Bank report, Axelrod participated in the bank’s Autonomous Driving Day in New York, where discussions centered around Tesla’s  Full Self-Driving  (FSD) technology, robotaxi development, and the Optimus humanoid robot. Somewhere in this high-tech mix, Tesla’s product plans for 2025 emerged, though the details were far from comprehensive. If true, this marks a significant shift in Tesla’s product strategy for the coming years. The report outlines Tesla’s strategy to unveil several new vehicles in 2025:    New models and 2025 volume growth     A new, entry-level EV referred to as “Model Q” is set to launch in the first half of 2025. In the second half of 2025, Tesla is expected to release additional models aimed at expanding its total addressable market (TAM). Tesla plans to build all new models on existing production lines, emphasizing efficient use of capacity to achieve its targeted 20–30% volume growth in 2025. While management remains confident in scaling up the China supply chain, the high end of Tesla’s volume target will require flawless execution, particularly in North America. A Budget (Driveable) Tesla           Illustrations Jean Francois Hubert/SB-Medien for Carscoops                     Now, let’s dissect the key points regarding the model presentations. Elon Musk  has been skeptical of low-cost models in the past, not out of dislike, but because of the significant challenges in achieving profitability, maintaining quality, and overcoming high development and production costs. If anything, it suggests Tesla is threading the needle by offering a lower price point without completely compromising its profitability. Future Cars:  What Could A Tesla Model 2 Look Like? Currently, Tesla’s least expensive vehicle in North America is the RWD, single-motor Model 3, priced at $34,990 with the $7,500 federal tax credit (or $42,490 without). This makes the introduction of a sub-$30K Tesla a significant move – assuming it’s more than just a smaller, stripped-down version of  the Model 3 . Stretched Model Y For China           Our speculative render of the 2026 Tesla Model Y ‘Juniper’ (Thanos Pappas for Carscoops)       The Deutsche Bank report also confirms recent rumors from China about a stretched, three-row version of the  Model Y . The addition is logical in a market where larger/longer family vehicles are highly appealing, enabling Tesla to better compete with local rivals. However, Tesla’s focus on expanding its Total Addressable Market (TAM) indicates the company is aiming to capture new customer segments – whether through pricing strategies, diverse body styles, or regional exclusivity. More:  Musk Predicts Tesla’s 2025 Sales Will Surge 30%, Gives A Nice Boost To Share Prices   Additional points in the report highlight Tesla’s confidence in scaling its supply chain, particularly in China, while also emphasizing the challenge of flawless execution in North America. Regarding Tesla’s much-discussed  Mexico  plant, its future hinges on geopolitical factors and tariff policies under the new Trump administration, which is an unpredictable variable, to say the least. A Critical Year Ahead   While the Deutsche Bank document offers an intriguing glimpse into Tesla’s roadmap, it stops short of providing concrete details. If the upcoming Trump administration scraps the $7,500 federal tax credit – arguably the key driver of EV sales – Tesla and the broader industry could face serious headwinds. Germany serves as a cautionary tale; after subsidies were cut in December 2023,  Tesla’s sales there plummeted by over 43% this year . Yet, as always with  Tesla , the answers remain as unpredictable as the company itself. Puts and takes for 2025 margins     Tesla explained that 2025 will be a year of product launches, and whenever that happens, there will be disruption to profitability as it will be in the early days of building a product and have more inefficient fixed cost absorption.",neutral,0.995

So why can’t you buy a Tesla in Alabama? In the U.S., Tesla has the largest market share of EV sales, dominating with 49%,  according to the Associated Press,  though other automakers are making inroads.

According to Tesla,  there are currently 16 Tesla supercharger stations in Alabama. But if you want to buy a Tesla,  you’ll have to drive a little while to look over the models in a showroom. Tesla relies on company-owned dealerships and online sales, rather than franchise dealership sales like other automakers. This strategy allows Tesla to control each aspect of the product, from assembly to sales.

There's also the fact that this incident took place in the rain, and Elon Musk famously refuses to use anything but cameras for its self-driving tech. On top of all that, back here in the US, a judge recently found ""reasonable evidence"" that  Tesla CEO Elon Musk knew about the defects of its Full Self-Driving software  (FSD), yet he allowed the system to continue operating. That is part of a case in Florida where a  Tesla Model 3  owner was killed when their car drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler truck in 2019. The feature is supposed to allow Tesla owners to summon their vehicle to them in a parking lot, or send the car off to park itself in a remote location. It appears Tesla is still  happy to use its customers as beta testers  in the real world while selling its systems as being complete, or just wholesale  mislabeling the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system . It's going to be a fascinating year as government agencies are  looking very closely at Tesla  and its automated systems, and the catalog of public mishaps and deaths is now long and in the public consciousness. Yet, Musk is set to head a new Department Of Government Efficiency that the incoming US president says will, “provide advice and guidance from outside of Government,” and “dismantle Government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies.”         Related     Tesla Full Self-Driving now includes a Hurry mode that aims to slice through traffic and get you there quicker. Musk has already publicly gone after individuals in government, including the Department of Energy’s chief climate officer in its  l oan programs office, the same office that awarded $465 million to Tesla Motors in 2010 and set the company up to become the market leader in all-electric vehicles. He was angry because Cummings' research and public comments criticized Tesla’s self-driving programs and called for regulating the systems. What the future holds for these semi-autonomous vehicles is unclear, but more crashes seem likely as Tesla works to ""solve autonomy.""         Source:  The Guardian (Australia)",neutral,0.992
