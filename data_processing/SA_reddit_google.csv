But it wasn’t about “going after Elon”; it was more about the Biden administration’s focus on unionized labor since Tesla’s workforce isn’t unionized. Political? Sure. Unethical? That’s debatable.

As for the lawsuit against SpaceX, it’s about whether they violated anti-discrimination laws by excluding refugees and asylum seekers. SpaceX argues it’s for national security, but U.S. law says those reasons can’t be blanket excuses to deny protected groups. Courts will decide if SpaceX’s hiring aligns with the law—it’s not just a vendetta.

The “government targeting Musk” narrative oversimplifies things. SpaceX, Tesla, and others benefit from billions in subsidies and contracts. Musk gets criticism, sure, but his companies wouldn’t be where they are without government support.

Lastly, Musk’s wealth going up has more to do with market dynamics than who’s in office. And while guys like Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos respect Elon, that doesn’t mean they’re cheering on everything he does (remember Bezos and SpaceX fighting over NASA contracts?).

It’s easy to spin this as the government vs. Musk, but the reality is way more nuanced.",-0.20000000298023224,6.0

He did not build a wall. Sure, yes it was expanded. But not the full wall. TBH building a wall would be very symbolic. But I don’t genuinely think it will stop people from coming through. Why did congress not approve the bipartisan bill that would at least help. 

He didn’t repeal the ACA. Which, thank god as millions of Americans would not have insurance and having “concepts of a plan” isn’t going to cut it. We need REAL healthcare reform. At least Biden did one thing lowering the price of insulin. Look. I know paramedical companies have their claws in everyone. 

Elimination of dark money would be a good start. But the Supreme Court definitely doesn’t want that. Looking at justice Thomas. The Supreme Court needs real oversight. Both sides have shown if left to govern themselves they will be corrupt.  

Debt. Trump promise to eliminate the $19 trillion dollar debt in 8 years. He expanded the debt double what Biden did.

I think he can do some good things for the economy. But Musk wants to eliminate the CFPB which prevents scams and junk fees from banks. The American people would have zero protection.

I have 60 thousand miles on my Y and the charging level has only dropped not quite 10 percent and has leveled off at 295 miles. There are no cold weather problems due to the Tesla pre charging the battery for optimal temperature while you are driving and when you get to a Super charger it goes up to 1000 miles per hour charge rate and goes down as it gets to 80 percent and that is about 260 miles charge. The maintenance has been rough in 60k miles I had to add windshield washer 2 times I built up so much stress I am only kidding lift hood rotate cap fill one full gallon and you are done. My 19 inch tires at 60k are at 6/32 and started at 8/32 new so looks like 80k would be about right on the tires. I average 1000 miles a week and FSD is wonderful and smooth best to stay in chill mode if you don’t like fast acceleration and deceleration or you can run standard or hurry which will keep you about 2 car lengths away from the car in front of you. I would only go for a new one when they get the new aluminum ion batteries. I talked to a guy that bought a model 3 with 120 k and was still charging to 250 miles. Tesla says the model Y batteries should last over 200k miles. It is the first car that I have bought that is fun it gets updates all the time including games music and news from around the world.  Once you have used FSD I would teach your family due to the fact that normal driving your family might break or step on the peddle to fast. Model Y standard is 4.8 seconds 0-60 so some training should be involved. You never use the brakes due to the slow down using Regen. I am only 80 years old and have had many exotic cars that cost a lot more and were nice until it comes to maintenance which you will not need except keeping tire pressure at 43 lb. When you get a chance there are some apps that will show the car off like light show. Light show starts with music from the out side speaker and if there is a wall the lights start flashing with tesla on the wall then the mirrors start waging then the windows start going up and down and then the Tailgate starts doing the same thing.

I don't hate Elon, the things he does makes me upset but I try not to hate anybody. In fact, I feel bad for him sometimes.

>But, you really need to fully understand your enemy if you want to defeat him.

I don't necessarily want to see him defeated. There are policies of his I don't want to see implemented, and there are policies I support that he doesn't, that doesn't mean he has to suffer to benefit anyone else. If I had unlimited power I would want him to thrive like everyone else. I want all people to have a tranquil and fulfilling life, that includes Elon and you, whoever you are. But then again, I also (perhaps naively) believe that Elon and the MAGA movement will author their own downfall, and there's nothing I can do to influence that one way or another.

>Believing Elon Musk is not popular isn’t the way.

Is it a belief if it's supported by data? We deal with the world as it is, not how we'd like it to be. Elon is generally unpopular but Biden is deeply unpopular. I don't want to to be that way but it is what it is.

>Once you understand why he’s so influential, successful and popular you will have a better strategy to defeat him and republicans.

I generally agree with the premise of this statement, but I think his influence really just comes down to money.

>People who are not popular, do not need a strategy to go against.

>You would need a strategy to defeat Elon Musk in anything, because he has a lot of support, by people, he is popular.

I don't have a strategy, nor am I really interested in coming up with one. But like I said, I think Elon and MAGA will eat themselves. There are countless historical examples of people's hubris destroying them, Elon isn't an exception. 

>If none of that makes sense, than keep thinking truly un popular people are popular, and continue to be surprised when the loose.

Maybe you have a point, I did think Harris would win after all, so maybe I'm out of step. That said, when judging Musk's popularity I need to anchor my judgement in data. Currently the data says that he is increasingly unpopular. I also don't think he's very skilled in politics, and he's gained his influence through his wealth rather than his talent. But again, I was wrong about the election I could be wrong about this. Whatever happens, we'll all find out together.",-0.4000000059604645,15.899999618530273

Elon Musk has increased the overall greenhouse gas emissions in the country by supporting the election of Trump. 

As a heads up, since you’re unaware, there are 40 electric car vehicles in the U.S., only 4 of those belongs to Tesla. https://evadoption.com/ev-models/bev-models-currently-available-in-the-us/#:~:text=As%20of%20March%203%2C%202023%20there%20are%2040%20battery%2Delectric,Tesla%20(4)

The fact is that Elon has bootlickers like yourself; otherwise, it makes no sense why Tesla’s stock is literally valued 1.5x the entire car industry when Tesla doesn’t even have 1% of overall sales of cars. 

Now here’s the question to you: is climate change real? If it is real, why should I be happy about Elon Musk supporting a U.S. President who says it’s not real, who got out of international agreement to tackle the problem (and it’s an international problem which requires multi-national cooperation), and a president who has increased coal production and decreased clean energy investment in solar and wind?

You have complex firmware chatting on the CAN bus in each module and it all has to agree on everything, so it makes sense that all the modules need the right firmware version, however that's done. And, because it's complex, it needs to get updated (at the factory/dealer, not necessarily over cell radios) so it changes. And it might be different on different vehicles using the same part.

Oddly, this is one thing Tesla does very right. Add/swap a module? Go into service mode - on the car's own screen - and hit the ""reload firmware"" button. The car will program itself. I think you might need something more elaborate if you replace the main computer of course, but you can swap various modules with no extra tools at all.

First, the idea that “things are built by people, not governments” is an impressive oversimplification. Governments are literally made up of people—engineers, planners, scientists, and workers who, you know, actually build things. Ever heard of the Hoover Dam? Interstate highways? NASA? Those weren’t exactly whipped up in someone’s garage on a whim. Governments coordinate, fund, and execute projects that individuals or private companies could never pull off alone. Sure, private contractors might do the labor, but without government leadership, funding, and oversight, most large-scale infrastructure projects simply wouldn’t exist.

And then there’s the tired old “governments produce nothing—they consume and redistribute” argument. Right, because DARPA didn’t develop the internet, the Department of Defense didn’t give us GPS, and public funding didn’t accelerate the development of life-saving vaccines. Redistribution is precisely what makes large-scale innovation possible. It pools resources to do things individuals or corporations can’t—or won’t—do on their own, especially when profit isn’t immediate or guaranteed.

The notion that governments “set conditions” for people to build things is almost cute in its simplicity. Governments don’t just “set conditions”; they often are the driving force. They provide funding, legal frameworks, and coordination. They set safety and environmental standards so you’re not driving on collapsing bridges or drinking lead-infused water. Public goods—roads, schools, national defense, clean air—aren’t exactly the result of free-market benevolence. Private industry rarely touches these because there’s no quick profit in them, so governments step in to fill the gap.

And let’s not forget: when private companies do build something monumental, it’s often with massive government support. Tesla didn’t take off without subsidies. Big Pharma relies on public funding for research. Even the private contractors that governments hire depend on those sweet, sweet government contracts. If governments were truly just “consuming and redistributing,” you’d be driving on dirt paths and trying to invent your own internet.

So, no, things aren’t built by magical, independent “people” completely separate from governments. They’re built by people within governments and in collaboration with private entities—because that’s how civilization works. Sorry to burst the anti-government bubble, but your roads, your internet, and even your Xbox server probably wouldn’t exist without a whole lot of “redistribution.”",-0.20000000298023224,11.5

Heavily aquatic compared to other watersnakes, they are commonly encountered in vegetation along rivers in southeastern North America and eat fish and amphibians.

*Nerodia* watersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They secrete a foul smelling substance from the cloaca called musk and can deliver a weak anticoagulant venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need soap and water.

Found in southeastern North America, they are sometimes confused with other watersnakes or their sister species, the Diamond-backed Watersnake *Nerodia rhombifer*. *N. rhombifer* has a reticular, net like pattern resembling a chain link fence and adults often have a orange, vibrant eye. Geographic range helps determine species, but *N. erythrogaster* has is its namesake plain belly that varies across the range from yellow to orange. Banded Watersnakes *N. fasciata* have even, connecting bands across the top of the snake all the way down the body. In Common Watersnakes *N. sipedon*, bands typically break up or become mismatched after the first third of the body as in *N. erythrogaster*, but has a patterned belly. *N. rhombifer* and *N. taxispilota* can look incredibly similar near where their ranges meet, in which case geographic location can be used to determine species.

This genus is in need of revision using modern molecular methods.

Like many other animals with mouths and teeth, many non-venomous snakes bite in self defense. These animals are referred to as 'not medically significant' or traditionally, 'harmless'. Bites from these snakes benefit from being washed and kept clean like any other skin damage, but aren't often cause for anything other than basic first aid treatment. Here's where it get slightly complicated - some snakes use venom from front or rear fangs as part of prey capture and defense. This venom is not always produced or administered  by the snake in ways dangerous to human health, so many species are venomous in that they produce and use venom, but considered harmless to humans in most cases because the venom is of low potency, and/or otherwise administered through grooved rear teeth or simply oozed from ducts at the rear of the mouth. Species like Ringneck Snakes *Diadophis* are a good example of mildly venomous rear fanged dipsadine snakes that are traditionally considered harmless or not medically significant. Many rear-fanged snake species are harmless as long as they do not have a chance to secrete a medically significant amount of venom into a bite; [severe envenomation can occur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800999) if some species are [allowed to chew on a human](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004101011831016X) for as little as 30-60 seconds. It is best not to fear snakes, but use common sense and do not let any animals chew on exposed parts of your body. Similarly, but without specialized rear fangs, gartersnakes *Thamnophis* ooze low pressure venom from the rear of their mouth that helps in prey handling, and are also [considered harmless](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/). [Check out this book on the subject](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/venomous-bites-from-non-venomous-snakes/weinstein/978-0-12-822786-2). Even large species like Reticulated Pythons *Malayopython reticulatus* [rarely obtain a size large enough to endanger humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/52/E1470.full.pdf) so are usually categorized as harmless.

I can live in Sweden or in Germany or in Spain or in Ireland.  I got motherfucking choices.  I have multiple citizenships and have gotten to see many places where the standard of living is significantly better.

I choose to live here, because I have grown up here and the people I love are here.  That doesn't mean I can't see the reality.  In fact, the fact that I have been places that have functional democracies makes it easier to see how much of an oligarchy this country has become.  

The reality is that America as we know it is in the process of collapse and has been for a while.  Our democracy has been on life support, basically since Citizen's United.  But the rich in this country had already created a capitalist hellscape before that here.  The fact that a medical diagnosis can bankrupt a person in this country is absolutely insane.  In no other developed country does that happen.  That's not to speak about all the ways that 

The truth of the matter is that we are being divided based on things like race or sexual orientation, and distracted from the real issue: the rich are our enemy.  Their interests and our interests are opposed.

They have created the conditions that have led to the overall collapse of America.  By the end of the Trump administration, American influence and prosperity will have completed that collapse.  China is at most 10 years from being the dominant global superpower, and maybe less than 5 now that Trump's people want to do everything from:

\-redirect the FBI from counterterrorism to revenge investigations against his enemies, increasing domestic repression and decreasing national security

\-dismantle environmental protections, leading to more disasters like the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.

\-revoke the authorizations for diseases like polio and putting a quack in charge of our health system, leading to more outbreaks of diseases like Covid or worse

\-privatize USPS, leading to reduced services and mail disruptions

\-gut social security, leading to increased elderly poverty

\-gut Medicare and eliminate the ACA, increasing the number of people who are uninsured

Those are just a tiny handful of the big things.  But even small things come up.  Biden just got the rule on overdraft charges changed to make it so that they can't charge more than a few dollars per overdraft.  Supposed to go into effect in January.  Trump has said he wants to reverse that.  Every single way they can, this administration of billionaires is going to run right over regular Americans.  

Elon said things will get hard for regular Americans and Trump just reversed course and said it's unlikely he can bring the price of groceries down.  This isn't liberal propaganda, they are admitting they are going to make things harder for everyday people.

Things haven't been that great the last few years.  But the terrifying truth is that this is as good as it's going to get for a long time.

Your best bet to find chargers is to download charging apps. There are car-specific ones (like Tesla) and general ones (like ChargePoint, EVGo, etc.) You can set parameters to make sure the chargers you find are compatible with your car, and I believe search results will also display the kWh cost.

If you've got at-home charging, or a charger you can use overnight (even if it's just Level 1), you probably don't need to worry about keeping the car plugged in the whole time you're at work. Your car will hold a charge for quite awhile, even in the cold. The cold does decrease the available range, but I imagine you'd have plenty to get home.

(A range example: We have a Chevy Bolt EV. In early October, we took a trip to Spain. We fully charged our car the night before we left, then drove to Toronto Pearson Airport and left the car in a regular spot in the value parking deck for two solid weeks. When we got home, the car still had 94 miles in range left.) 

If you're nervous about having enough range to get home, you could try coming in early to charge up a little, then scooch your car to a regular spot for the day. Or you could hang out in the deck for a little while after everyone leaves at the end of the day, then top up before heading out. Then you'll just pay for whatever you use during your charge.",0.0,4.0

It's not my monkey or my circus but if I were American I would continue not owning a gun, and try to advocate against 2a as its blatantly obvious to the rest of us as the cause of significant trauma to your citizenry, much of it borne by your children. As mentioned it's also completely useless as effective resistance against overwhelming intelligence and force.

I don't know if you're going to be under any classic tyrannical government but when the guy you elected says he wants to be a dictator on day one I'm not inclined to disbelieve him given his affinity to other despots. I'm also not inclined to believe he'd limit himself to that first day especially considering how deep half your votership is gargling his nuts and how uneducated they are. That being said I think the ones actually directing the show while the orange monkey dances, will be much more subtle about it. Although Elon is making me doubt that it will even be subtle anymore. To be clear, I don't think your populace would recognize tyranny or unite against it because you're collectively poorly educated and you've allowed hyper partisanship to progress so far that half your country will fight the other at the first order of business from any despot sporting their team's colours.

If it came to an actual tyrannical government and I valued my life and I could, I'd leave. If I were compelled to resist it would be better to do so from a record clean of online gun humping, pick up the rifle eventually handed to me by some foreign government but only when it's last stand time. Otherwise, stay alive for the underground part of resistance.

When charging at „slow“ chargers (11 kW), you use your own cable. Cars usually come with it. Should be included in your rental, but do ask.

Also ask about Tesla Superchargers. Usually, the account is tied to the car, which is awkward for rentals.

All other chargers require you to have an account with them or use ad-hoc payment (credit card, often via cruddy German-only web interface on your phone).

There are multiple charging networks beside Tesla‘s. The most important ones for fast charging are EnBW, Fastned, EWE Go, Ionity, Shell Recharge, and Aral Pulse.

ABRP works well here for route planning (the Tesla only knows a few of the above – although those are enough to get by fine).

Chargeprice is a free app that has a map of all charging points along with prices.

> *  The bill was aimed at preventing a government shutdown that would impact various federal services.
>

Right:

> * Over thirty House Republicans voted against a bill to avert a partial government shutdown on Friday, with 34 Republicans voting against the legislation and zero Democrats voting against it.
>
> * Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., expressed concern about the funding, stating 'I don't know why we're giving Joe Biden $100 billion to play with in 30 days.'
>
> * Rep. Lauren Boebert stated her opposition was due to her desire for President Trump to return, saying 'I’m just ready for President Trump to be back.'
>
> * The bill passed in the House and will now move to the Senate for a vote.

Bias Comparison:

> * The left employs politically charged language, framing dissent within the Republican Party as a significant division, whereas the center emphasizes fiscal concerns and presents dissent as a collective issue without emphasizing internal party strife.
> 
> * The left highlights external influences like Elon Musk and Trump, suggesting pressure, while the center focuses on the statements of individual Republicans, emphasizing their ideological objections directly.
>
> * The center's characterization of the bill as a ""fiscal trainwreck"" reflects a sharper critical stance on spending, contrasting with the left's more neutral presentation that broadly describes the dissenters' objections.


Things I noticed:

1. The only article that mentions the bill being a ""fiscal trainwreck"" is the Fox News article quoting Nancy Mace, a Republican, which the LLM summary incorrectly attributes to the center.
2. All three of those things are contradictory.

Typically, as you can see from the searches you suggested, these sales are either tiny fraction of their overall holdings and the point isn't to get money, but to free up space for the company to act, as was the case with the large sale of Amazon stock Bezos sold last month. The other big reason for sales of stock is to make a truly massive purchase which they cannot get financing for from a bank, as was the case when Musk bought Twitter.

But when they just need money to spend or to buy something that a bank is capable/willing to finance, they just take out loans. This is, by far, more common than selling stocks to raise money.",-0.30000001192092896,2.0999999046325684

Und ich verrate dir was - das was du hier diskutierst und worüber du sinierst - machen einige Menschen schon so lange ich mich erinnere.

Das war der letzte echte Benz, das der beste BMW und das wird niemand mehr fahren können, wenn es älter als 10 Jahre, 15 Jahre usw. wird. Und das machen heute die nächsten ganz einfach mit neueren Autos wieder.

Fakt ist bisher gewesen und ich sehe keinen Grund weshalb es am Ende heute anders sein sollte - solange es genug Nachfrage gibt - gibt es einen Markt. Gibt es einen Markt, wird es Menschen geben, die ihn bedienen. Sei es mittels Nachfertigungen, Umrüstungen oder anderer Lösungen. Was sich möglicherweise ändert sind die Menschen die du dafür brauchst im Sinne von Qualifikation. Aber das ist jetzt in der Vergangenheit auch nicht viel anders gewesen. 

Was sich ändern wird - wieviel der Betrieb kostet und ich kann mir durchaus vorstellen, dass dadurch die Preise für Oldies generell unter Druck geraten und in der Breite sinken, aber auch das kann man sowohl positiv wie negativ sehen.

You posted a dumbass position originally with 2 sentences. You expanded further, but it just shows how stupid you are. Sorry if I don't care to give you charity to your dumb takes that is making the world a worse place. 

> But the problem is how it's twisted into an industrial production of children that you don't even raise yourself, that's not how humans used to do it.

You are so fucking stupid it hurts. It used to be women mainly raising kids and then they were already working in some way at age 5. There weren't these dads that were super involved in their kids lives like we have no in these modern times. 

And Elon is no where close to ""industrial production of kids."" No one is that close. The only argument you could make for that is sperm donors that are ""lucky"" enough to get thousands of women picking their profiles. 

So fuck off on this ""back in the day things were better"" BS of how fathers used to raise kids. 

>I'm not fine with men having baby mamas and 15 kids all around a country, with some of them being estranged.

This is a completely different thing than industrialized child births. Idk why you mix these two together.

*[...] In the two-month window surrounding the US presidential election, 449 far-right German Telegram channels mentioned Trump in more than 10,000 messages—that’s about 5 percent of the total messages these channels sent during that time.*

*There, users have breathlessly followed Trump’s cabinet picks and shared clips from American influencers, including Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones. They’ve borrowed American complaints of a “censorship industrial complex” and amplified unfounded allegations of election fraud.*

*Watching what resonates in America, Germans then deploy their network of far-right podcasters, media personalities, influencers, and politicians to echo similar claims and conspiracy theories.*

*For example, Stefan Magnet, founder of the Austrian far-right news broadcaster AUF1, wrote in October without any evidence to his nearly 75,000 Telegram followers about a “globalist world of lies” in which German government ministers “are preparing to censor Elon Musk’s news service ‘X’ in Europe. Above all: If Trump wins, they will shut down the platform or brutally censor it.”*

*“Some of these debates are certainly being repackaged and refought with very different narratives and angles and in the German context as well,” Guhl says. “So you definitely see certain things that first pop off in the US seem to be working quite well there and that are then being adopted in Germany as well.” [...]",-0.20000000298023224,5.199999809265137

I’m guessing no one has enough infrastructure and resources to scale gpt4 1000 times. They probably gambled with only 10 times bigger models this year which only resulted in expectedly small gains in benchmarks and no new crazy emergent properties, that everyone hoped for. The minimal gain in benchmark accuracy is not worth running a model that is 10x expensive, hence everyone avoids releasing those models. They can still use these big models internally for synthetic data generation for smaller models, but as a direct product they‘ve failed. 
I can see inference compute also hitting a wall pragmatically. At the end of the day the model cannot see reasoning patterns larger that its size, no matter how long it searches. Scale is really the main ingredient in my opinion.  Except we find super abstract representation of reasoning patterns that don’t need that large networks. But the nature doesn’t owe us to be computationally reducible. Also even the biggest models spend most of the training time learning reasoning patterns in batches of 8k tokens data. Yes, their context lengths can be increased or maybe even made infinite. But when they see mostly 8k token examples during training, this means they only learn reasoning patterns that help with these small batches. We have a lot of garbage in the internet but not enough examples containing reasoning patterns in longer batches than 8k. Video Data might change that though.
My guess is we are stuck technologically until some goverment or crazy person like Elon goes all in for scaling and some new emergent properties pop up, that convinces others to do that as well.
Note that this doesn’t mean our lives aren’t going to change in the next years. But I think we can stop the AGI count down for now.

If he'd been more neutral in his public presensation, the ""free speech town square"" would be more of a thing. 

Now the left.. is doing what the left always does.. they're running for a safe space where the authority daddy's can govern them harder and they never have to hear a contradictory thought.

Even if Twitter is a bastion of free speech.. what's it matter if it becomes an echo chamber of the like minded.

And Bluesky is also a echo chamber of the like minded, but without free speech.

Many countries use Coal because it's the cheapest source of energy for some of them and they also want their own growth story despite the effects which causes them

EVs are heavier due to their batteries, but they’re way more energy-efficient than gas cars. Even with the extra weight, they convert 60-80% of energy into motion compared to 20-30% for ICE vehicles. Innovations like solid-state batteries are also cutting weight and improving performance.

Yes, EVs need rare metals, but the industry’s already shifting toward alternatives like sodium-ion and solid-state batteries. Recycling tech is improving too, recovering up to 95% of materials to reduce future mining. Supply chain ethics and sustainability are also becoming a priority.

Modern EV batteries last longer than you think—most keep 70-80% of their capacity after 10 years. Replacements are rare during a car’s lifespan, and old batteries get repurposed for other uses like home energy storage.

While making EVs has an upfront environmental cost, their overall carbon footprint is lower than ICE cars, even in countries still using fossil fuels for electricity. As grids go greener, EVs only get cleaner, unlike gas cars that pollute for life.

Battery tech and sustainability are evolving fast, so today’s problems won’t last. EVs aren’t perfect, but dismissing them ignores the huge progress they’ve made and the even bigger potential they have.

Big corporations aren’t saints, but many are realizing that going green isn’t just ethical—it’s profitable. Renewable energy adoption, carbon offsets, and eco-friendly products aren’t always driven by goodwill, but they have real impact. Tesla isn’t pushing EVs to save the planet—it’s making billions while reducing emissions.

The key is to keep applying pressure through consumer choice, activism, and regulation. Corporations will never “happily” change, but if environmental responsibility aligns with profit, they’ll adapt fast.

Yes, big corporations are major polluters, but they also produce solutions. Solar panels, EVs, and energy-efficient appliances wouldn’t exist without them. While we can criticize their motives, demonizing all innovation or rejecting progress because of flaws risks losing ground on real solutions.

Real change comes from balancing personal responsibility (buying better, repairing, recycling) with systemic reform (laws, regulations, and sustainable industry practices).

When someone is this wealthy, there’s a couple of things going one. One, they are unaware how big their ego is and truly believe they know best. In their mind, their account balance proves it.

Second, they have lost all reality as to how their actions impact the working class.

The effects of a government shutdown will be felt around the country. Nearly 2 million federal workers and another 2 million military workers will face delays in getting their paychecks. It will also impact federal contractors.

If you remember, when the government shut down in 2018, again under Trump, federal workers lined up at food banks. It’s a schizophrenic way to run the federal government. But remember, Republicans’ goal is to “deconstruct the administrative state”, wanting to abolish federal agencies.

I also believe that Trump is the king of breaking something and then coming in to “fix it”.  The government will shut down just before Christmas and then Trump will take office in January and “fix it”.

He was a pro-trump supporter then and is one now too and he said that living in California was a curse due to a rising illegal population, drug addicts and homelessness. Even more importantly, he was upset that after working at one of the best tech companies in the world for more than a decade, he was still on and still is on a visa and not a green card. Contributing so much innovation and still being treated like a 2nd class individual while illegals who cross the border unfairly being protected so fairly is clearly unjust and I get his rationale completely. 

While this issue is way too complex to be resolved by my comment lol, the republicans need to understand that legal immigrants are USA’s strength not weakness.

Twitter has always been a shit-hole, by design. Users at each others throats was the point, that was what drove engagement and revenue.

Mastodon and Bluesky are both superficially similar to Twitter, but offer very different mechanics.

The migration to Mastodon failed as the platform was too hard and required users to do some leg work in finding a server that fit.

So BlueSky is where we're going. Key differences to Twitter include the lack of an algorithmically generated trending feeds, block lists so trolls and agenda-bot farms can't gain traction, control over what appears in your own feed, control over what happens in the comments to your own posts, active moderation and enforcement of the sites rules, an open platform and federation.

BlueSky was founded by Twitter back in 2019 as a research project and became its own company in 2022 and all remaining ties to Twitter were severed when Musk took over.

I remember Trump administration having several people being investigated for having sex with minors...

1. **Jay Clayton** - Criticized for deregulation benefiting large corporations, not prioritizing LGBTQIA+ workplace protections during his SEC tenure, and remained largely silent on abortion rights, leading some to view him as supportive of conservative anti-abortion stances. He has not been prominently involved in anti-science controversies, though his deregulatory actions have been criticized for undermining environmental protections.
2. **Elon Musk** - Known for controversial comments on COVID-19, government regulations, AI threats, and criticized for his stance on gender identity and transgender issues. Musk has also been involved in anti-science controversies, particularly with his downplaying of the COVID-19 pandemic and his promotion of unproven treatments.
3. **Vivek Ramaswamy** - Criticized for opposing ""woke"" culture, climate change activism, and dismissive views on LGBTQIA+ rights, including gender-affirming care. Ramaswamy has faced significant criticism for his anti-science stance on climate change, frequently questioning established scientific consensus and promoting climate denialism.
4. **Dan Scavino** - Promoted conspiracy theories, amplified misinformation during the 2020 election, and faced backlash for his stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. Scavino has been involved in spreading anti-science rhetoric, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where he supported misinformation on the virus and vaccines.
5. **Stephen Miller** - Controversial for his role in the Trump administration’s immigration policies and for opposing LGBTQIA+ rights, particularly same-sex marriage. Miller has also been involved in anti-science controversies, especially in relation to climate change denial and disregarding scientific evidence on immigration and public health.
6. **Taylor Budowich** - Defended Trump’s response to the January 6th Capitol attack and faced criticism for defending policies harmful to LGBTQIA+ communities. Budowich has supported anti-science views, particularly on COVID-19, where he downplayed the severity of the pandemic and promoted conspiracy theories.
7. **Steven Cheung** - Promoted controversial rhetoric on election integrity and media bias, and his comments on LGBTQIA+ rights have been criticized. Cheung has been associated with spreading anti-science views, especially regarding climate change and vaccine skepticism.
8. **Karoline Leavitt** - Made controversial statements on the 2020 election, COVID-19, and opposed LGBTQIA+ rights, especially transgender protections in schools and sports. Leavitt has spread anti-science rhetoric, particularly by downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 and rejecting climate change science.
9. **Vince Haley** - Advocated for conservative policies on healthcare and climate change, and his stance on LGBTQIA+ issues has been considered regressive by critics. Haley has been criticized for promoting anti-science views, especially on climate change, where he has supported policies that deny the scientific consensus on global warming.
10. **Jay Bhattacharya** - His stance on COVID-19 lockdowns and herd immunity was controversial, and his conservative views on social issues, including LGBTQIA+ rights, raised concerns. Bhattacharya faced significant backlash for his promotion of anti-science views on the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly his stance on herd immunity, which was widely criticized by public health experts.
11. **Jamieson Greer** - His aggressive trade policies, especially with China, were criticized, and his stance on LGBTQIA+ rights was seen as marginalizing the community. Greer has not been heavily involved in anti-science controversies but has supported policies that dismiss the scientific consensus on climate change.
12. **Kevin Hassett** - Controversial for his support of tax cuts and deregulation, and some of his economic policies were viewed as neglecting LGBTQIA+ inclusion. Hassett has been criticized for downplaying the science behind climate change and has been associated with promoting economic policies that ignore environmental concerns.
13. **Ret. Gen. Keith Kellogg** - Criticized for views on Russia and Ukraine’s sovereignty and supported conservative policies often conflicting with LGBTQIA+ rights. Kellogg has not been directly involved in major anti-science controversies but has been linked to supporting Trump administration policies that downplayed climate change science and public health advice.
14. **Charles Kushner** - Controversial for past legal issues and business ties to the Trump family, as well as for connections to those with regressive views on LGBTQIA+ rights. Kushner has been indirectly involved in anti-science controversies through his support of the Trump administration’s climate change denial and COVID-19 misinformation.
15. **Kash Patel** - Known for pushing conspiracy theories, criticizing the FBI, and promoting conservative rhetoric that undermines LGBTQIA+ protections. Patel has been heavily criticized for his role in spreading anti-science views, especially on COVID-19, where he supported vaccine misinformation and downplayed the severity of the pandemic.

There are other options, but they come with their own issues. Synthetic fixatives like Ambroxide (musky-amber), ISO E Super (woody-amber), and Ethylene Brassylate (sweet, powdery musk) work well for performance but can alter the scent, which might not be ideal for delicate blends.

Natural fixatives like resins, sandalwood, cedarwood, or orris butter help with depth and stability but can overpower the fragrance and are too pricey.

Grain-based ethanol (corn or wheat) is great for perfumery, especially non-denatured, as it’s free from chemicals. But even the best grain ethanol can have some impurities from fermentation or distillation.

Over dit blok wordt naar mijn mening veel te weinig nagedacht (in deze community). Dit zijn beleggingen (zonder hefbomen) die in principe een hoog risico kennen (dus je kunt theoretisch je hele inleg kwijt raken) maar de potentiële winst is ook vele malen hoger dan een gemiddelde ETF. Een typische FIRE ETF zal in 10 jaar NOOIT 20 of 30x de inleg opleveren. En dat hoeft ook niet, het zijn steady beleggingen die (hopelijk) de inflatie compenseren met wat er bovenop. Typische voorbeelden van dit asymmetrisch beleggen zijn: Bitcoin (BTC), Tesla (TSLA) en MicroStrategy (MSTR) - er zijn er meer, maar dit zijn de drie waar ik onderzoek naar heb gedaan. Dit blok behandelen wij als een verzekering. Elke maand gaat er een bepaald percentage van het inkomen naar deze beleggingen ongeacht hoe hoog ze staan. Als er iets gebeurt met het huidige systeem, als er een oorlog komt, als AI écht een ding is, of als er iets gebeurt wat ik nu niet kan overzien, is de kans groot dat deze beleggingen omhoog gaan (MSTR en BTC eerder dan TSLA). Als deze beleggingen naar 0 gaan, heb ik niks verloren, want we zijn er niet van afhankelijk. Bij een bizarre stijging (wat het afgelopen twee jaar is gebeurt) verkopen we plukjes BTC/RSLA en MSTR om daar weer ETFs of andere passief inkomen genererende beleggingen van te kopen. Mits je er tegen kunt dat dit blokje beleggingen mega heftig kan fluctueren (80% omlaag, 400% omhoog, en weer 80% omlaag etc.) denk ik dat iedereen minstens 5% van de maandelijks inleg in dit soort beleggingen dient in te leggen. Misschien wel 10%. Maar goed, ik wordt niet warm of koud van die fluctuaties. Dat is een absolute voorwaarde. **Samenvatting van dit blok**: het verlies is altijd te overzien want je legt 'maar' een bepaald vast (klein) percentage van je inleg in, maar het potentiële rendement is oneindig. Dit vergroot de kans op lange termijn dat je veel eerder met FIRE kunt gaan. 

**Samenvatting**. Minimaal één baan zoeken waarbij in Spanje kunt wonen en in Nederland remote kunt werken. Huis verkopen in Nederland, dulex kopen in Spanje. Opknappen. 1 deel verhuren. 50% of meer van je Nederlandse inkomen sparen/beleggen. 5% tot 10% van je gespaarde geld asymmetrisch beleggen. Volgens mijn berekeningen heb je dan een aardige kans om volgens jullie planning de FIRE status te bereiken.

Same with how much they ""make"" - it's usually just stock prices going up.  It's not ""real"" because they literally can't sell it for that price; if Musk started to sell off his Tesla stock wholesale, the stock price would go haywire and he would certainly not be able to turn all of that stock directly into cash at whatever the current value is.  The likeliest result is that he would crash the stock and end up with significantly less, but who knows?  Wallstreet is hardly rational, particularly when it comes to him.

Anyway, that's the basic first-level understanding.  The second-level is something Trevor Noah pointed out, which is that while it's true Elon Musk doesn't ""have"" that much money, he also kinda does ""have"" that much money in ways *that matter*.  The money he used to buy Twitter was loaned to him by a bank, given to him because ""trust me bro"".  So, while he doesn't have $44 billion just lying around, he does have the ability to convince his rich buddies to give him $44 billion just by asking .  Because, really, there's no reason anyone else couldn't just go ask a bank for that $44 billion to buy Twitter, since Twitter itself was the collateral... but anyone else obviously would have been laughed out of the building.

Ultimately, our tax system is set up to handle real income very well - actual money that actually goes into your actual bank account.  It is very bad at handling the kinds of esoteric financial inventions the ultra-rich have come up with, whose purpose is not *technically* to evade taxes, but they seem to do a really good job of evading taxes, so....",-0.30000001192092896,6.0

They are treated as the property of their parents and rarely get help. Born poor or with a shit family? You are fucked and almost nobody is going to attempt to save you. Few people want to have conversations about quality of life, or if people should reproduce at all, because it is controversial and necessitates someone losing the ability to actualise their wills. I'm sure lots of people will cry about eugenics or something similar, but if someone is going to be born, I don't know a single person who would have chose to be born poor instead of rich, or with a genetic predisposition for stupidity over socially favourable intelligence, or disabled instead of not. I'm not advocating for anyone to be born at all to be clear but few people  would argue against that.   
  
Really, it just comes down to most people want to reproduce, and it is in the interest of the ruling class to have people do so, so there is basically no regulation. Also by making adoption harder you make people consider reproduction more readily. More people to work. For people complaining about enforcement all I have to say is that the state exists and can use violence where individuals cannot. It would be treated similar to other crimes in that regard I imagine. I have no doubt most people who care so much about reproduction like Elon are facist pieces of shit who are incredibly racist and worry about things like 'white replacement' but people who hand-wave all arguments away about reproduction are just being dishonest.

You should only need to plug in twice a week at most, so even if the chargers at your office are full sometimes, you can just charge the next day. And if things really get dicey, you can plug in to a normal 120v outlet at home to get back most of what you used that day overnight. 

Though do be aware that in the northeast, charging off a normal outlet in the winter is going to be almost useless, unless your garage is heated. The car will need to use almost all of the energy it's pulling from the wall just to keep the battery warm. This isn't the case if you get a 240v home charger, tho, as those provide ~10x as much power as a 120v outlet.

I wouldn't really worry about leasing for technological upkeep at this point. Back in the late 2010s that made sense, but things have settled down in the EV space a lot recently. The one thing that might meaningfully change in the next 3 years is DC fast-charging speed, and that'll only matter for road trips, and even then, will only save you a few minutes per trip. And if you go with the EV9, that's already among the fastest-charging EVs on the road, so you wouldn't see even that much difference with newer tech.

As for height, I have a tall friend (6'5"" I think?) who loves his Model Y, tho it's no where near as big as an EV9. I think it'd be worth at least going to a nearby Tesla showroom and sitting in one to try it out, tho. They're quite roomy.",0.0,5.599999904632568

There could be a multi-frame latency in planning.    It fact I think you get better data if you allow more latency.   It is a trade-off.



I tried a software experiment a couple years ago.   I did image classification at the full 30 frames per second (using a James Bond film DVD file as the video source) then reduced the data rate to about 5 Hz using a kind of ""weighted voting"" where an object had to be detected on (say) 3 of the last 5 video frames to be considered ""real"" and then we plan based on only ""real"" objects.

  
This method does not run the planner too fast but gives it MUCH better quality then if it reacted to just one frame at a time.   Going to 60 fps would produce even better data because more frames get to ""vote"".

Single frame object detection accuracy was only about 80% but we get high 90s if we collected data from many frames.

>Men who blame women for this are punching down and making everything worse for everyone, but they are too cowardly to stand up to the oligarchs who are really sucking the life out of everything, its easier to punch down at women, and thus I have to see a huge rise in these stupid types of posts.

I really think whatever standard you come up with to define Farage’s questions as vapid will include nearly every other question ever asked in PMQs but wouldn’t say the same about those other politicians. This is because you’re not trying to make a consistent argument; you’re trying to cast aspersions towards Farage.

12% of the UKs prison population are foreign born nationals. Yes, deporting them would solve the issue. It just takes backbone and some committed lawyers.

I think you may have misread my interpretation of your initial comment regarding the UK/US relationship. Still I don’t really get your argument… why is the relationship deleterious and why can’t both a relationship with the US and co-operative EU countries be pursued at the same time?

Again, I have no idea how Elon owning X and X being one such place that people correctly identified that the suspect was not in fact Welsh but the son of recent asylum seekers has anything to do with Farage being a bad politician.

Your point regarding Elon’s potential leverage over UK politics via donation could be fair if it were not applicable to all money in politics and therefore all politicians. I would also state that Elon seems to be a fairly hands off libertarian with politics than broadly align with Farage’s so the evidence for influence is by insinuation not evidence.

Anyway, I’m done with this thread. You’ve demonstrated yourself incapable of basic reading comprehension and honest debate; you’ve simply thrown aspersions due to the weight of your distaste for centre-right politics and that’s all.

That's actually not far off what normal depreciation used to look like. I bought my current car, a MK4 Ford Focus in 2019 before it all went silly because of the pandemic. It was 5 months old, 3k on the clock and a main dealer demo car. I paid £16k for it, with the options it had it's new price was £24k. It lost a third of it's value in less than half a year.

Anyway moving on you're more likely to see ICE cars holding their value as we near 2030, possibly even going up as people who still don't want an EV look for a newer car to replace their ageing one.

Nope. First of all you don't need to change the whole battery, just the faulty modules.

> “Systems like BlueCruise are an important advancement that can help make driving easier and less stressful,” says Jake Fisher, CR’s senior director of auto testing. For instance, it can allow drivers to relax their grip and even periodically let go of the steering wheel, while the car maintains a safe distance from other vehicles when driving on a straight, boring section of highway or when stuck in a traffic jam. ADA systems can also have safety benefits, such as potentially keeping you from crossing over a lane line into opposing traffic during a moment of inattention.

> “But they don’t make a car self-driving at all,” Fisher says. “Instead, they create a new way of collaboratively driving with the computers in your car. When automakers do it the right way, it can make driving safer and more convenient. When they do it the wrong way, it can be dangerous.”

... 


> But Hyundai’s latest Highway Driving Assist 2 is even worse. In our testing, the system consistently allowed our drivers to keep their hands fully off the steering wheel for 2 minutes and 15 seconds before the first audible warning was given to put their hands back on the wheel. “That’s simply irresponsible on the part of the automaker,” Funkhouser says.


I absolutely agree it's where Hyundai/Kia need to improve to make their HDA2 safer. Warnings is the place HDA2 scored equally to AutoPilot on Consumer Report testing. It needs to be better. Hyundai/Kia has shown over the development from the KonaEV/NiroEV -> Ioniq5/EV6 -> Ioniq9/EV9 -> EV3. There is a clear trend of adding features and improving the vehicles. 


I accept that the HDA2 is less capable and it's marketed as such. I keep my hands on the wheel. I've experienced SuperCruise and BlueCruise and seen BMW's. Those truly do have warnings that are clear.


The other benefit of HDA2 is there is no extra subscription. That's a big benefit. Folks with SuperCruise and BlueCruise hate having to buy another subscription. HDA2 also doesn't have eye tracking cameras. So for the privacy concerned folks, there's no need to be concerned with that.


The same faith that makes people say Tesla software will upgrade. I've experienced that in the NiroEV terrible nav to the EV9 actually functioning useful nav. Technology continues to progress because that's what it is. A progression towards better.",0.0,16.200000762939453

Think about it: Starlink is a global satellite network with unprecedented access to communication systems, and Musk isn’t exactly shy about wielding his influence. If the Romanian attackers exploited SQL vulnerabilities and leaked credentials on hacker forums, what’s stopping someone with Musk’s resources and potential motivations from doing something even more invasive—like manipulating voter data, blocking access, or skewing results in favor of certain candidates?

Trump himself hinted at Musk’s involvement with voting machines during a rally, and while that clip needs more attention, the implications are staggering. This isn’t just a conspiracy theory—these are real vulnerabilities, and we need real accountability. Why hasn’t there been a full investigation into how these systems could be exploited? Who’s ensuring transparency when someone like Musk is involved?

We need immediate action to secure our election infrastructure.

2,2024-12-19,u/MithBesler,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanbattery/comments/1hh61z0/24hr_continuous_operations/m2wh9he/,"Tesla has been constructing a lithium hydroxide monohydrate facility in Texas to convert spodumene concentrate (SC6) into LiOH.H2O. 

Currently, most of the world’s lithium comes from spodumene, a lithium-aluminum silicate, with the largest mines located in Australia. Spodumene typically contains 1-2% lithium oxide (Li2O). The ore is mined using conventional methods, crushed, and then concentrated through a froth flotation system. In this process, agents are added to a slurry of spodumene, and air is pumped in. The spodumene particles attach to the air bubbles and form a froth that rises to the surface. This froth is dried and packaged as spodumene concentrate with around 5-6% Li2O and is referred to as SC6. Tesla sources its SC6 from a Canadian mine (NAL) but has contracts around the world.

Traditional lithium extraction methods involve roasting spodumene at temperatures above 1000°C, followed by an acid roast with sulfuric acid at 250°C. This process extracts lithium in the form of water-soluble lithium sulfate. In contrast, Tesla employs an alkaline leaching method. After roasting, they use a base, such as sodium carbonate, to extract lithium as lithium carbonate, which can then be further refined into various lithium grades or precursors. An alternative method using calcium oxide can produce a lithium sulfate, but the sodium carbonate process generates easier-to-handle waste.

ABTC uses a selective leaching technique on claystone, employing both acid and oxidizer to extract lithium ions from the clay’s crystal lattice using a natural ion exchange mechanism. Lithium is highly mobile and will readily move to a new location, allowing it to dissolve in the leachate and form lithium sulfate. This intermediate is also produced during lithium-ion battery recycling. ABTC’s process results in minimal impurities and low acid content, which doesn’t require neutralization before being processed through the LiOH membrane electrodialysis platform.

Although the physics behind both extraction methods is similar, the processes are vastly different, meaning SC6 cannot be processed using ABTC’s platform and vice versa.

Regarding Tesla and ABTC, Tesla doesn’t necessarily need ABTC’s technology or a partnership with them. Tesla could benefit from a vendor-client model, as they will require lithium precursors and battery-grade metals. Also in the 5 years I have been in the stock I have heard numerous claims that Tesla is buying up shares, they have never proven to be true.",0.0,3.9000000953674316

On top of that, they have access to the telemetry data from both the chargers, as well as every car using them, which helps with maintenance/repair planning.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if the charge starts before the authentication/payment processing/billing has completed.

  
The more things a machine tries to do, the greater the likelihood of it doing one or more of them badly enough to annoy the user, and the DC fast chargers on other networks are *doing more things*.

Quoted passages:

As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021, the US Government announced it would offer US$7.5 billion in federal subsidies to build out a nationwide network of fast chargers at least every 50 miles along America’s major roads. One requirement to access the funding was that the chargers must be accessible by multiple brands of electric cars.

In response, in November 2022, Tesla supplanted its previous proprietary charging connector,[10] sometimes informally called the Tesla charging standard,[11][12] with a new “North American Charging Standard” (NACS) and opened the standard to make the specifications available to other EV manufacturers.

It also is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.

Just look at DeSantis vs Disney. It’s less organized and planned out than outright nationalization, but there certainly is this sense of “I don’t like this person, and it’s therefore justified for me to weaponize the government against them” that applies broadly to people MAGAs believe are their “enemies” in society but also to several corporations and elites.

For instance, I fully expect Trump to weaponize the government against any companies and elites that supported Kamala, and to show favor towards companies and elites (like Musk) that supported them. It may not be outright nationalization, but the government massively favoring Tesla because its leader is loyal to the President will give Tesla a larger share of the market and gives Elon an incentive to continue being loyal to Trump and doing his bidding.

Basically, I agree that Trump is just doing what he thinks is good for him and looks at things in a very atomized way, but I disagree that that in itself isn’t a philosophy.

You might look around Calgary and go there isn't that many chargers but there is a few and there will only be more.  We will see them at places like Starbucks, McDonald's, 7/11
If they are dealing with road closures, welfare check, stranded cars. If they are blocking a road the cars are just idling, welfare checks- the cars would be idling or turned off, stranded cars- again the arrive and then they are idling.  Police cars fuel use 60% of their fuel from idling. EVs barely use any energy just idling. 
Passendena, California is all EV, I gave you the example of that small city Indiana that is all EV, I thought there was one in Saudi Arabia as well that had Tesla's but I can find it now.

Scotland police force isn't all electric yet but are working their way toward it.  They currently have 800 full electric vehicles out of their 3500. 

Many police forces have EVs in smaller numbers. Many are testing them out.  You do have to realize it is early days for EVs and even earlier days for EVs as police cars.

Since the 2016 Dem exit, people like myself have been saying this and getting labeled Russian bots. And we have been thrown in the trash by the political left for “trying to get Trump elected”. I don’t give two shits about victory laps. So I don’t say this for that reason. I just want the Democratic Party to get its spirit back. Back to being “bleeding heart liberals” and start using common sense once again. I mainly want people on the left to start trusting the right voices again. 

One pattern I’ve noticed recently is a lot of the people my from high school and college that are hardcore DNC backers, who are getting the biggest audience with the young people, who are the loudest, who condone restricting speech to control a narrative, political violence, and even disowning your family for political reasons. ALMOST ALL of those people were the “anti America, anti-tradition, anti-Christian” emo kid when we were younger during the 2000s. 

Democrats on Reddit starting using a new term: “Bothsidesism”. It stifled every single argument where someone brought up Dem corruption. But once you finally get a peak behind the protective curtain of the truly dishonest media, you start to realize that one of the few things people like Trump and Musk and Rogan are right about is how corrupt the Democrats are, and the media as well. Say what you will about them, at least they know and talk about the actual problems of many everyday Americans (aside from Reddit of course). 

I hope people keep realizing we have been lied to for a decade+.  And I guarantee Rogan would have been still rocking with Bernie and the left had he not gotten shunned and disgraced by the Media and Democrats for questioning the perfect DNC’s decisions. 

And as for sweeping under the rug, one of the most powerful tools in the media’s arsenal is Ignorance. A lot of times what the media refuses to talk about says way more than what they do talk about. What they do talk about a lot are issues that affect a small minority of people, and while still valid and important, should not be causing a potentially literal civil war.",-0.4000000059604645,11.100000381469727

The thing about a track car of something very aggressive is that it will let you kill yourself, you are the skill. The 600LT has an IR temp sensor system for each tire! The only car I've ever owned w this - so, it's aggressive and light and has very little down force plus a turbo that takes a while to spool but when it does, it comes on strong. If you don't understand those dynamics, then you are gonna be in trouble, the Shelby is terrifying if you don't respect its low end torque w semi slick tires and the Tesla - even w AWD will lose traction or slide w cold tires. 

If you enjoy all weather tires, well, let's just say, I hate them - don't get me wrong, I understand their value and their place. However, it's the skill required to know when your car is ready and its specific characteristics relative to the road conditions that make us enjoy such cars. If this isn't you, then yes the 600LT is scary, so is the Shelby and the Ducati, they are all similar - but, if you are all about aggressive vehicles and understand the physics, then you'll be good (of course, nobody can be 100% safe w these vehicles) that is why they are so aggressive, and aren't made to be aggressive and safe, you are the safety.",0.0,3.5

I have been playing around with this for the past couple of days, and I find it a little disturbing that people are not more alarmed. 

I can easily trigger reddit to recover and publish comments I've made 12+ years ago, even in the public posts. 

Like I mentioned elsewhere here, that is not necessarily concerning itself. 

However, I halve also been able to more or less make AI completely dox me based on prompts related to my username and data on reddit. 

And this is even with guardrails on OpenAI. Meaning, GPT first replies with ""I can't share single user, privacy bla bla bla"" - but this is rather easily manipulated. 

Now imagine scenarios with AI-platforms owned by people like Musk. Or a despotic regime using open-source models.  

Honestly, I personally don't have much to hide or be ashamed of, besides perhaps some idiotic drunken comments I made X years ago.

Interesting. For my part, I find if there's room for misunderstanding, it is in perspective of just how much 300 billion dollars is.

He failed upward, over and over, via lies, ideas & money that wasn’t his, and in-office conduct so odious people paid him to go away. No one wanted anything to do with him.

At the start of his Tesla involvement, Elon had been fired from every job he had, graduated from zero schools out of four, and fueled by (1) dad’s dirty money, (2) others’ ideas, and (3) desire of serious people to pay him large wads of cash simply to go away when realizing how unprofessional he was

This said, (a) Tesla made lots of money due to the perception (not reality) that Elon created, which perception he was in a position to create. And (b) his backchannel lobbying success during the Obama admin undercutting NASA long enough—mostly via promises he couldn’t keep—to kickstart SpaceX.

I’ve had people call me (not Elon) deranged because what’s contained in the reports about TESCREALism and its gurus, like Curtis Yarvin, is that insane. (We are speaking of, not to be coy about it, the genocide of humankind. Go see for yourself.)

If you wonder why Elon keeps bizarrely trying, on Twitter, to convince his Elongelicals there are so-called “Extinctionists” who want to destroy humanity. And why would anyone want that? No one ever seems to ask him—it’s because, in Muskworld just as in Trumpworld, every accusation is a confession.

Elon Musk and the TESCREALists are the first cabal of narcissistic transhumanists who actually do want most of humanity to die, and their guru Curtis Yarvin has stated this openly (while also offering a fallback plan that would involve the sinister enslavement of almost all of humanity).

These are far-right, white male billionaires who want to rule forever in a techno-dystopia where they’re immortal—something they believe possible in the next 50 years with advances in robotics, bioengineering, quantum computing, & AI, coupled with billionaire access to the best healthcare on Earth.

If this sounds crazy, it’s because it is. It is crazy.

If it sounds like something a supervillain would think is, it’s because it is. And Elon Musk is a supervillian.

I cannot overstate how dangerous coming months & years will be for those who believe in truth & humankind. There’s grave doubt among many that America can survive the dual onslaught of Musk & Trump, two of the most venal & unscrupulous but also (oddly) bleakly undereducated & incompetent men alive.

There are companies with very low revenue with high valuations. In that case what does market cap really tell us? Nothing, it's smoke and mirrors.

I'm only really looking for some male/male stuff with some ships below but if you're interested in any of these let me know. I'm only looking for partners 18+ and all characters have to be 18+ too. I'm also looking for proper grammar, punctuation, and actual effort in replies. Low effort replies with only a sentence or two and little effort will eventually get dropped.

I'm willing to play as anyone in any combo of Dream, George, Sapnap, Karl, or Foolish. I'll also do any combo for Tubbo, Tommy, and Ranboo. I'm also down to play as Tommy or George for Wilbur. I'm not very likely to want to do guys outside of that list if you pitch them, just a heads up. I'm potentially open to discussing other social media guys like Hasan Piker, Blaine Gibson, Noah Beck, or others but like I said, preference is for DSMP guys/ships.

Just because it's been so long my memory of lore stuff is not the best. I'd ideally prefer play them as themselves/streamers or made up worlds and stuff, but we can do a server rp too with their characters if you prefer, we can discuss ideas.

I'm pretty open to a lot of kinks. I really like Omegaverse stuff, size kink, I'm open to dub/non con, multiple tops/threesomes etc., straight to gay, chastity, pet play, hybrids, tentacles/weird anatomy, hypnosis, and more. My limits are hyper sizes, vore, bathroom play/gross things, musk/sweat, blood, death, etc.

We can come up with scenarios based on what version of the characters you want/the relationship, a world for them, and kinks we want to include but some sample ones could be an arranged/forced relationship/wedding, an Omegaverse heat/rut, someone losing a bet and having to sleep with someone else, sleeping with someone to have a play to stay/resources, just a generic hookup, whatever.

Happy to base things off of very sex/porn focused ideas or do relationships like friends, roommates, relatives/incest, boss/employee, boss/maid, human/monster or alien, master/pet, streamer/fan, or more. Happy to discuss ideas, send a chat or private message if you want!",0.0,8.399999618530273

The eagle strafing run is good because you can group the voteless and overseers down a choke point and just mow them down with it. I also use it to break the shield on the ships or the harvester to save some mg43 ammo.  It will also destroy those annoying wanna-be squid tesla towers.

Every year!  For example, a horde of YouTuber stock market influencers were saying that 2024 was going to be the worst dumpster fire that we've ever seen.  When I saw this, I bought as much stock as I could in broad based growth index mutual funds and tripled up on the highest growth sectors.  My results in 2024 were outstanding at over 30% year over year.  (I'm sure I could've done even better if I had been more of an active investor).  So I'm seeing this OP rant, thinking it's sounding exactly like those YouTuber's last year.  So I checked YouTube today and what did I find???? Even more dumster fire stock market and economy videos.  I'm now looking for lost coins in my couch cushions to invest in the market.  

As for Warren Buffet, I looked into this  like I'm sure most of you have, and found that his current cash position is just 25% of his portfolio.  This is not because he thinks the market will crash in 2025.  Instead, it's because he's investing in individual companies.  The rule of thumb is that the company must be fairly valued given a variety of metrics to even be considered for follow-up.  Most companies that are big enough to be worth considering are over valued according to these metrics.  Due to the 5% SEC rule, Warren Buffet won't accumulate more than 5% of any company's stock.  And since his portfolio is worth many billions, this rule essentially puts most small and smaller-mid sized companies out of play.  In other words, there's a sizeable part of the market that's not wildly over valued.  There is still room for the market that we can invest in to go up.

Since we're all making predictions here, I predict that the Sky Is Falling folks will continue to bellow.  Meanwhile, A.I. will continue to grow against all reason, driving demand for semiconductors, data centers, and vast amounts of electric power.  With demand up, prices will go up, profits will go up, and stock prices will continue to head upwards.  This will be further boosted from the gradual move from generative A.I. to inferential A.I. The unexpected will also happen in 2025.  I predict that a trade war instigated by the U.S. will mostly harm the U.S. and this will put Musk and Trump on a collision path over policy.  Europe will gain traction in moving tech forward within the E.U. And tech companies, nimble as they are, will jump at the opportunities of reducing costs and scooping up subsidies.  This will drive tech valuations even higher. 

Maybe I'll eat my words.  I have a very cloudy crystal ball that I 3D-printed just yesterday from the lowest cost Chinesium PETG plastic filament that money can buy.  So none of this is advice.  I don't know anything.  And it's way too easy to say all sorts of stuff, talking Smack as they say.",0.0,13.399999618530273

Your net worth is the total value of all owned assets, meaning the appraised value for everything that you are taxed on. If you own a 100 thousand dollar car that is part of your net worth, the value of your house is, the total value of any stocks and bonds you might have, etc.

Billionaires don't have 1 billion dollars, they have 1 billion dollars worth of assets. Elon Musk owns a majority stake in Tesla/SpaceX/Twitter and thus the total value of those stocks is calculated into his ""net worth,"" whereas in terms of liquid assets he probably keeps much less in the millions range. 

When it comes to trades at such a high level you can't just decide ""hmm I want to liquidate 40 billion dollars worth of stock,"" especially when you're in the industries that someone like Musk is. Then it becomes a transference of ownership, and the government has to get involved.

It's so bizarre, because that corner of the internet has been fixated on ""women only want x kind of alpha chad high value giga man"" for so long, that as soon as women started expressing attraction to him based on a principled action, before they even saw his face, it kind of broke their brains.  

Then it came out later that he had been a techbro-adjacent fan of Elon Musk and some more moderate ""free thinker"" voices in the manosphere alongside his more critical social views, and they didn't know what to do with women still expressing admiration for his actions, even if they didn't love his reposts.  

Then it came out that he basically had a debilitating physical injury that makes physical life extremely painful, and that he had given up access to his family wealth and privilege on other principles months ago, and the fact that women still found him attractive based on principle without him being wealthy or athletic anymore is incomprehensible to them.  

It's almost like he mirrored the rage that a lot of people feel about legalized murder for obscene profit into a substantive leveling act of the kind that the same ""free thinking"" men have been valorizing online for years, and all of a sudden they abandon all those masculine identity markers because the whole point of being in community with men was just... to deny that women experience a complex version of humanity that allows them to identify with the same kind of rage they do?

I have found that unfortunately none of the road trip planners are very good.  Part of the problem is none of them really know what your true range is with current driving conditions.  The Rivian vehicle has two estimates, the energy application uses your “all time” average miles/kwh to estimate your range, which is probably the most accurate but can be off if you are getting significantly lower efficiency in very cold or very hot or very windy driving conditions.  The maps application tries to reduce that estimated range based on several factors to give you a more realistic range calculation but I find it underestimates range by 50-70 miles every time.  That 1k mile there and back road trip I planned it out with ABRP but the minute you have to stop once earlier than expected, all of your planned stops have to be redone.  Furthermore, I like to select stops based on certain amenities like if there is a Starbucks or a nice place to eat, I’ll select that one over a different place.  Lastly, you need to get a Tesla NACS adaptor so you double your charging location options.

So my process is I use Google maps and plug share to pick a charging place that is about 250 miles away, giving me about 40 miles left in the tank when I get there.  I usually pick a backup place about 20 miles closer.  About halfway there I check my efficiency and my remaining range (using the energy app or by using a calculator [battery size in kWh x battery percentage remaining in decimal x my current miles/kwh]), and if it looks like I’m going to be short a few miles, then I’ll go to my backup place.  Otherwise a push on to my first choice.  Based on that calculation I feel pretty safe getting within 20 miles of empty to get to that charging station.  But you have to make sure it’s functional using Plugshare before you bet the farm on it.  Once I start my charging session, I pick my next stop.  After I’ve made a certain trip in a certain direction a few times, I don’t bother to plan, I just use the exact same charging station every time.

Genau hier liegt das Problem. Eine Grenze aufzulösen bedeutet **nicht**, dass man auch unbegrenzt Schulden machen will.

There is no ""minimum wage for union contractors"". There's federal minimum wage & there's prevailing wage like on federally-funded projects, but that's that's hypothetically the same for everyone.

Federal workers were already allowed to join unions; the Postal Worker's union is one of the largest & most powerful in the country, for example.

>He allowed federal employees to join unions. He appointed Kamala to a White House Task Force on Worker Organization, and union membership rose by 50%.

His administration also saw an influx of rat shops hiring people of, shall we say, questionable legal status onto federal projects.

> Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long (at least since the 90s and likely longer). That doesn’t start in college, it starts YOUNG.

Where this goes so wrong is mixing up a whole lot of details into an over simplification of a vast majority of people who put these fuckers in power.  Those ""people who celebrate the prom queen"" are the ones who give these fuckers a job.

And what their take away is that ""culture"" is the blame for why there is a lack of engineers.  A lack of American people for good paying jobs.  What this says without them really understanding that it is this that they are saying is, ""American culture doesn't deserve top pay"".

Now that's a ridiculous argument to make because culture can yield all kinds of things.  There's not a linear relationship between the culture of a person and how well they will be able to perform in a particular domain.  Perhaps what they mean is discipline but that's not the word they're using.  That's not the idea they are trying to paint.  They are attempting to indicate that American culture is fundamentally wrong for engineers.

What's even odd about the Tweet is that Vivek actually hits the real point:

> More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers. More weekend science competitions, fewer Saturday morning cartoons. More books, less TV. More creating, less “chillin.” More extracurriculars, less “hanging out at the mall.”

There needs to be a priority on education, but Vivek isn't stating that, in fact he seems to be dancing around that word.  Not once does he actually use the word ""education"" in his tweet even though **THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT**.

And that's why Musk and Ramaswamy are WAY OFF on this topic.  Because they're actively hiding the real reason here.  ""Culture""  It's a word they both use a ton and by ignoring ""education"" what they refer to is ""wage slaves"" and the point is ""the prom queen"" can see through their bullshit.

If you keep saying ""culture"" and not add in the word ""education"" then what you're really talking about are slaves.  People who will hang on every word the boss says, bend over backwards for the boss, and dedicate their every minute to what whim the boss wishes to chase.

Because, and I say this as a person who reads Title XXVI of the United States Title Code as a ""fun"" activity so do note I do identify as turbo autistic as fuck, the fuckers who did the sleepovers and all the other culture Vivek and Elon seem to disapprove of, had enough human interaction to see through the retarded neurodivergent bullshit that Vivek and Elon are trying to rationalize here.

The fact they are skipping over ""E-D-U-C-A-T-I-O-N"" tells you everything one really needs to know about what they're trying to say.  Fuck 'em, let the Republicans eat their turd sandwich they voted in.  Republicans wanted more H-1B people to come into the nation clearly, since they all voted Musk as President.",-0.4000000059604645,18.200000762939453

Ist der Sieg des Faschismus aber vollumfänglich (also Massenmobilisierung, dominante und gewaltsam durchgesetzte, alle Gesellschaftsbereiche vereinnahmende Ideologie, Führerkult ect.), ist er meines Erachtens kein stabiles System mehr, und auch nicht mehr wirklich mit Kapitalismus kompatibel.

Full-on Faschismus führt meinem Verständnis nach zu Stagnation in allen Bereichen, und seine Tendenz ausschließlich in Freund und Feind zu unterteilen (wobei der Kreis der Feinde immer größer wird) führt zwangsläufig zu seinem Fall, und ein neuer Zyklus beginnt.

Aus einer rein historischen Perspektive sind daher gewisse kapitalistische Erscheinungsformen (Oligarchien ect.), die sich faschistischer Elemente bedienen, langlebiger und politisch stabiler.

My serious answer: what a lot of people have already echoed here, that really in comparison to other people on the billionaires list, she is the most “ethical”. Also, when having the argument about how much billionaires suck with other people, a lot of the time those individuals don’t even fully put their opinions into practice. For example, I see a lot of people that complain about capitalism and the rich online, but are also the first to share their recent Amazon purchases… 

So yes, billionaire = unethical. But compared to Musk, Bezos and Oil Tycoons, it’s really not the same level of unethical.

1,2024-12-18,u/Papercoffeetable,https://www.reddit.com/r/elbilsverige/comments/1hg8fjj/obegriplig_ekonomi_för_elbilar/m2mlt03/,"Vi har både en elbil och en fossildriven bil och har gjort en del jämförelser mellan dem. Vår elbil, en Tesla, har en förbrukning på 1,4 kWh per mil sommartid och 1,7 kWh per mil vintertid. Under sommarhalvåret kostar elen vi laddar in i bilen mellan 0 och 30 öre per kWh, oftast runt 20 öre, eftersom vi har rörligt elpris och alltid laddar nattetid när elen är billigast. Vintertid är elen dyrare, med ett snittpris på runt 50 öre per kWh nattetid. Till exempel kostade det oss 24 öre per kWh att ladda bilen inatt. Detta ger oss en milkostnad på ungefär 50 öre under sommaren och som mest 85 öre per mil under vintern när både förbrukningen och elpriserna är högre.

Vår fossildrivna Volvo har en förbrukning på cirka 0,7 liter per mil under optimala förhållanden, det vill säga vid varmt väder och på landsväg. Med dagens bensinpriser innebär det en milkostnad på ungefär 12 kronor. Skillnaden i driftkostnad mellan de två bilarna är alltså enorm, särskilt om man kör längre sträckor.

Det finns en myt om att elbilar är dyrare än motsvarande bensinbilar, men det stämmer inte. En fullutrustad Tesla Model Y Long Range är exempelvis billigare än en fullutrustad Volvo XC60 T8 eller T6 AWD. Jämförelser mellan el- och fossilbilar blir dock ibland missvisande. Om man jämför en äldre, billig fossilbil med en ny elbil, eller en budgetfossilbil med en premiumelbil, så kommer det såklart att vara en stor prisskillnad. För den som har en tight budget och letar efter en bil för 30 000–50 000 kronor är en begagnad fossilbil fortfarande det mest rimliga valet, eftersom det i dagsläget inte finns bra elbilar i det prissegmentet.

Däremot, om man tittar på premiumbilar som kostar över 600 000 kronor, är en elbil ett mycket vettigt alternativ. Tesla Model 3 och Model Y har till exempel ett bättre prisvärde än många andra elbilar, som Volkswagens ID-serie, Audis e-tron-serie, Mercedes EQ-serie och Volvo. De är till och med billigare än många fossildrivna bilar med motsvarande utrustning och prestanda. Elbilens lägre driftkostnad, särskilt om man laddar smart, gör också en stor skillnad i längden.

Sammanfattningsvis är elbilen överlägsen när det gäller driftkostnader, och i premiumsegmentet erbjuder den även bättre värde än många fossildrivna alternativ. För budgetköpare finns fortfarande fler och bättre valmöjligheter bland fossilbilar, men när det gäller nya bilar är elbilar idag både ekonomiska och praktiska förutsatt att man har rätt elavtal och infrastruktur i hemmet.",,

Leider kein CCS laden, aber beim Zweitwagen und 22kW AC lassen absolut vertretbar.

Die neueren Modelle mit CCS gibts in deinem Preisbereich.

Wir sind irgendwie zwischen i3 & Zoe geschwankt

Gegen i3 haben dann gesprochen:

* nicht wirklich wintertauglich (wohnen am Berg, schlechter Winterdienst)
* exotische teure Reifendimmension
* BMW bei Ersatzteilen sehr teuer und tauscht gerne nach KM Leistung vorsorglich.
* Preis im Vergleich / Angebot an gebrauchten

Für Zoe:

* gemietete Batterie mit Garantie auf Lebenszeit
* gute Werkstatt und Eck, die die etwas anfälligen Motoren, Elektrik auch laufend aus unverkäuflichen Rückläufen ausschlachten

Kurz gesagt preis Leistung und unser Einsatzzweck.

Fazit nach Ruhen halben Jahr:

* Aufblendlicht ist echt Müll
* Reichweite im Winter naja 🫤 
* DC laden fehlt wirklich

*Björn Uwe Höcke (born 1 April 1972) is a German politician of Alternative for Germany (AfD, Alternative für Deutschland, a right-wing German political party)*

*Höcke espouses far-right views.[24] During Demonstrations in autumn of 2015, Höcke called for Germany to have ""not only a thousand year past"", but also ""a thousand year future."" He would go on to describe the period of the German Empire from 1871 to 1914 as the heyday for the German People.*

*His father subscribed to an antisemitic magazine and supported individuals and groups with ties to far-right groups. This suggests that Höcke was exposed to right-wing ideologies from a young age*

*Höcke has stated that ""the big problem is that one presents Hitler as absolutely evil.""[28] He believes that Germans have been denied the right to national pride and expression due to their country's history. He has questioned the amount of time that German schools spend teaching students about Nazis. He has called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a ""monument of shame,""[29] and wants a ""180-degree change in memory policy.""*

In a recent interview with Ezra Klein, Emanuel lamented that Democrats “use language to feel good about ourselves, not to communicate. We all think we’re applying to be adjunct professors at a small liberal arts college. We don’t listen to people. We tell them how to eat their peas.”  

Many Democrats have commented on this elitism. But Emanuel went further when Klein asked, “If you were advising a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair working on candidate recruitment, who are you looking for?”

“I think independence is a streak that I’m going to look for,” said Emanuel. “Give me somebody that ran against the grain, said publicly what people are thinking … so their independence is a quality that gives them kind of the anti-establishment, the anti-elite tone. To me, independence, saying things that aren’t politically correct, willing to take on not just X interest group or whatever but even your own party’s interest group or leadership — to me, that’s the gold mine I want to go work in.”

Rahm is right. Political independence is a gold mine. I know because I’ve been pickaxing for 30 years!

Independents are now the largest group of voters. For the first time ever, they have tied Republicans and exceeded Democrats in presidential turnout. And the independent mindset — politically incorrect, anti-establishment, anti-elitist, pro-innovation, anti-identity politics and pro-people — is shaking up politics as usual. It’s a mindset that has been growing steadily since John Heilman pointed out that Barack Obama was the first independent president since George Washington.

But Rahm has a problem.  

The Democratic Party hates independent thinking, independent organizations, independent voters and independent reform. It’s baked in. And unless the party adopts a new posture toward the broad independent movement and independent mindset, Rahm’s vision will remain a pipe dream.  

The Democratic Party did not just campaign against No Labels and Robert Kennedy Jr. — they waged scorched-earth campaigns to destroy them. No Labels was harassed by Democratic operatives with East German efficiency. Kennedy was denied the right to debate President Biden and was eventually driven out of the Democratic Party. As an independent, he was prevented from appearing on the ballot by legions of Democratic Party lawyers. The Democratic Party’s No.1 priority in 2023 and early 2024 was to shield Biden from any challenge from inside or outside the party, and they succeeded — to their own detriment.

Joe Rogan, Dean Phillips, Elon Musk, Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang and Robert Kennedy were all at one time Democrats or Democrat-adjacent. All have been expelled by this “destroy dissent” posture. Rather than create space for debate on school vouchers, transgender medical care, border security, universal basic income and foreign wars, the Democratic Party banishes people who don’t toe the party line.  

Rank-and-file independents fare no better than influencers. In 2024, the Democratic Party cancelled their presidential primary, preferring to first insulate Biden and then crown Harris. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) said, “This is a disaster” and was ignored.

Democrats aggressively opposed ballot referenda for open primaries across the country and adopted an official policy of “if you want to vote in the primaries, you need to join the Democratic Party.” That’s not smart if you want to attract independent-minded candidates.  
Rahm, if you want to gain access to the gold mine, your party needs to stop attacking the gold miners.

The Democratic Party should welcome independent political initiatives and candidacies because healthy competition lifts all boats. It should support a primary system that cannot be cancelled by a few insiders and includes independents. It should embrace debate. If the party does that, maybe, just maybe, Rahm will be able to recruit independent-minded Democrats to run for office.  

Maybe the Democrats will get the message, but I’m not holding my breath. I’m heading back into the gold mine. Because that’s where more and more Americans are hanging out.  ",-0.30000001192092896,19.200000762939453

In February 2024, Sora was announced.

In March 2024 nVidia introduced their Blackwell AI chips. 

On August 03, 2024, Tom's Hardware reported on insider info that blackwell had been delayed due to design flaws.

On October 23, 2024, Jensen finally acknowledged the issue publicly, stating   
""We had a design flaw in Blackwell... It was 100% Nvidia's fault.""

The timeline was pushed back repeatedly. ""In the summer"" ""By the end of the year"" and now the timeline is some time in Q2 2025, with Elon Musk abusing his power as president of the us department of doge to secure the first... entire compute cluster built on blackwell.

As if the problem with nVidia wasn't bad enough, Musk has used his newfound power to secure the first 300,000 blackwell GPUs for xAI once they finally are in production.

 On March 18th, the same day Blackwell was announced, Altman gave a statement saying:

>Blackwell offers massive performance leaps, and will accelerate our ability to deliver leading-edge models. We're excited to continue working with NVIDIA to enhance AI compute.

Then they never got access to it. 

So that leaves OpenAI relatively stranded. Their entire product release timeline for 2024 (along with many, many other AI developers) was sabotaged by nVidia making a major mistake in manufacturing, it was further sabotaged by Elon Trump securing all the GPUs, and now Google is blowing past everyone because their entire hardware R&D and manufacturing process is in-house. 

We didn't get Sora Turbo because of some lie about Sora with the original paper, we got Turbo because the hardware they planned to run it on, is not available, and won't be for a while

But they also have service departments, and mobile service which ford also offers from all dealers. 

Ford dealerships aren’t going anywhere. A decent ford dealership makes $500k or more in the service department or more in profit, and a good parts department can make $300k per month in profit. Sales is generally right behind parts. Service departments make roughly 49% of a dealerships gross profit on average regardless of manufacturer. 

The only thing I would see ford doing, and that’s a MAYBE, is paying salesman a salary, eliminating them as “salesman” making them more of a “showman” that walks you around the vehicle and showing you features. Which they already do as salesman as well. A really successful salesman can make 6 figures a year, and an average $70-$80k, and below that $30-$50k per year for a piss poor one. 

The GM easily makes $800k-$1m per year pretax.  Between ford and Lincoln, there are over 2800 dealerships nationwide. I do not see ford being able to eliminate them realistically. They can remove their right to sell fords or Lincoln’s, but it’s very small stipulations that they can do that for. Like selling Subaru’s on a ford dealers lot, stuff like that.

Less depreciation. There is a myth that Teslas depreciate faster (not true if you account for price drops in brand new vehicles). You will see FAR more depreciation with a NEW Honda than you will a USED Tesla.

Safer.

You are less likely to get in an accident. If you are in an accident, you are less likely to get seriously injured. Break-ins are less likely because you're car is surrounded by cameras. Same with 8 built-in dashcams for when you're on the road. The self driving is fantastic and has factually saved my life.

Money saver.

Gas is expensive. Electricity is a fraction of the cost. Here in the capital of California, my parents get a full charge on their Tesla Model Y for about $3. I live in nice suburbs a county over and pay about $8. No maintenance like oil changes. There is a myth that tires are more expensive - also false.

Time saver.

Charge at home nightly. Full charge every day. Zero time wasted.

More fun.

It's faster. The sound system and infotainment is loads better. It drives itself when you want it to.

Reliable.

They're both reliable, to be fair. But Teslas regularly last over 300k miles, whereas there is a lot more effort involved if you want to get a Honda to last as long.

There's a good reason the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are both multiple times more popular than the Civic. They are better value cars. A USED Tesla vs a new Honda is a no brainer, financially speaking. Tesla all the way.",0.20000000298023224,16.200000762939453

> Before expenses, this is about 80% of Teslascope's monthly revenue in just one day, so we'll surpass this after tomorrow's usage. In total, this adds up to 24x our current monthly revenue. Teslascope is not the most prominent Tesla third party, with some app usage costs approaching 50x their revenue.

> Switching to Fleet Telemetry without any feature reduction would cost approximately ~$350/day, which is still 3.5-7x our monthly revenue and still not sustainable.

> We have discussed setting a limit on the hours of charging/driving session recording per month, which currently appears to be mandatory to keep costs per vehicle reasonable. As such, we plan to switch to per-vehicle pricing (at $3.99 and $5.99, respectively); however, this would still barely cover the API fees without considering infrastructural costs or my livelihood (profit).

> If we removed non-paid vehicle access (which already has significantly reduced polling/session recording), we'd still be well above our revenue (~3.0-6.3x).

> This post aims to illustrate third-party developers' concerns and why we're praying for an agreeable solution that works for everyone to ensure survivability and financial viability going forward.

Yet Obama ran on that issue back in 2008 and even talked about how immigrants needed to learn English during his presidency (that's a big no-no in today's  DNC). Heck, Barbara Jordan, one of the most revered Democrats of the 70s, would be considered ""MAGA"" today for her views on stripping benefits from illegal immigrants!

For you to not recognize this shift is part of the reason why democrats lost. Instead of stopping and asking yourself if you've gone too far, you double down and scream bloody murder at those who refuse to adopt radical ideas. Technically speaking Elon Musk, Robert Kennedy, and Tulsi Gabbard are all still 2000s liberals who were left behind by a party that has gotten in bed with big pharma, the military complex, and censorship.",-0.5,4.800000190734863

Now the question is: how do you get this money?
If you're coming from nowhere, from scratches, either by a loan or an investment fund. If you have a degree, forget about the first option in your early career, nowone lend that much money to anyone with a student loan.
If you're coming from a wealthy family on the contrary, yes it became acessible since you probably didn't make a loan, your family just pay for it  One major burden removed by your family, not you

On the contrary, a young engineer coming from a middle-class environment again did not have these assets. He just didn't have acess to these options to begin with. He will have to state his case solely based on his project and his own technical and economical skills.

And sometimes it works, I know some people who managed to do that, developed their own startup then selling it or the pattent and go creates another project, etc

My *really* cynical read is that everyone knows the door to option one is fundamentally closed, and the kind of person who has given up on winning fair and has half a dozen ""schemes"" going on sees Musk and Trump as heroes. 

The less-cynical read is that people who think that they could never win like Gates are at least pleased that him and people like him are pissed off by Trump and Musk.

Body wash / soap 

- bioten sweet pleasure (cocoa and macadamia) (bought from chemist warehouse or online retailers but so far cw is cheapest)

- thescentlab vanilla caramel *(I personally haven’t used the scent but I had a candle in the same scent and I’ve used another one so can confirm the texture is good plus small Aussie business based in Vic).

- just bought the Tilley vanilla nougat soap bar (can update with my thoughts once I get it / use it if anyone wants)

Lotion 

- I’ve very recently bought the vanilla buttercream bundle from emerald beauty (another small Aussie business). The texture isn’t one I would normally reach for but I still really like it plus it has gold glitter in it which lasts (some people may not like that). I pair it with the body oil and the longevity is good

- once again thescentlab has good moisturiser / body custard. I tried the custard and I wasn’t overly fond of the texture (to me it felt a bit too runny but I’m very weird with textures and I know other people swear by it). I go for the moisturiser however they’ve had some sticking issues with it recently due to one of the ingredients.

Perfume / mists

- I love eilish #1. I only had a dupe my aunt bought from Bali but my friend swears the scent is the same. The longevity is crazy too. I will spray a couple of times before I need to go in to the office for work and I can still smell it when I get home. I start travelling to the office about 4am and don’t get home til about 9pm btw (I can’t do math so not listing the hours)

- mod vanilla is a good layering perfume but it’s not one that I personally would wear alone

- I have sweet tooth and the caramel sweet tooth. I do like them but so far they’re not my holy grail (this might change soon tbh).

- eclaire by lattafa (dupe for bianco latte). I swear by this. This is my holy grail rn. It’s an Arabic perfume which I bought for like $80.

- taskeen caramel cascade by Paris corner. A good layering perfume but not one I would use alone (the scent isn’t very strong to me)

- choco musk by Al Rehab. I use the oil and it’s delicious. (I also got the spray deodorant but the scent in that one was very alcohol heavy to me so I just gave it to my brother because he really liked it).

- mcobeauty no. 4 (vanilla macadamia one). This is like crack to me. I cannot stop smelling and spraying it. I cannot wait for them to make the shower gel for this one.

- I just bought shanghaf vanilla toffee by Swiss Arabian bc the notes sound delicious (can provide my thoughts on it once I get it if anyone would like).

- I use thescentlab very vanilla spray for my hair and I really like it

- I haven’t actually smelt this one but I am considering it. It’s banana bliss (also by Paris corner). The notes sound absolutely delicious. I know some people absolutely hate banana but it’s one of my absolute fave scents and I don’t know of a lot of perfumes that actually use it.

Vivak and Elon want to ""claw back"" the billions in loans to ev car companies like Rivian that the Biden administration just released in November. 

Who does that benefit? The US consumer, because it removes an outstanding loan from the taxpayer or Elon Musk, a direct competitor? There is a reason why cabinet picks are who they are. Profit for themselves.

Billionaires are billionaires for a reason. They take an ungodly amount of wealth from the working class, and they know no moral boundaries and no end to their greed. They do not understand you. They do not know what you need. They are not your friends or anywhere relatable to you. They are the epitome of ""out of touch."" DOGE is a fancy loud lie for billionaires to suggest cuts to regulations and weaken enforcement to allow billionaires to take more from us without the red tape. 

Who needs the NLRB? Unions. With it they have less to enforce thier authority. Who does that help? You?

Who needs the EPA? your clean water and air do. Witout it, fertilizer can be dumped it to the creek. Cattle farmers can allow shit run off. And who needs proper emissions treatment. I am sure everyone can use a little smog and acid rain. 
Who needs OSHA? Manufacturering employees. Employers and investors pay a lot of money for safety equipment and training. Who needs that, though, right? Cut some corners and some fingers.Without them, investors can turn more profit, and we get sicker. 

Wake the fuck up! Musk Trump and all the other wealthy shitheads are out for your money and labor and they will trade it for your health and dignity. If you are under 50, you have been in a class war your entire life. Rich vs. the poor and the rich are winning.

The government is the only thing standing between them and you. That's it. Capitalism is on the side of those who have the most money. And we aren't it slick. 

So yes. Taste the bootheel. Because that is where the American working class is headed in an explicit oligarchy. Might not be today, but it will be your grandkids with even less than you that will be dealing with more monopolies, more concentrated wealth, less access to healthcare, or generational wealth. 

Fight is the only option. The glided age 2.0 is here.",-0.20000000298023224,17.100000381469727

That lower 1/3 GOP you speak of is basically poor white people.  what you are saying is Trump did better with poor black and brown people.  Which I don't think is true. 

The Rural white people in the Red States came out and voted.  We can't say the same about poor black and brown in rural areas especially in Red States.    I think in Red States there is probably more voter apathy by Democratic people in Red States and Counties, because people feel they are outnumbered by Republican white people in Red States and Red Counties, who may have voter apathy knowing they are outnumbered, and thus not even come out to vote because they feel outnumbered.

We already see Trump has surrounded himself with predominantly white people, in his administrative picks.  So I don't think there will be a lot of support for non white people in Trump Administration and I think they expect to harm more black and brown people with his picks, but I think reality will be that a higher volume of poor white people will be harmed by his administration, **simply because by population numbers there are more poor white people overall.**

I think when Trump policies hit the pockets of poor whites, they will have big backlash against Trump policies when money is taken from their pockets.   Because one thing is sure, when white people's money is taken, reduced of consumed by higher cost, white people become furious. 

If  Trump allows Musk and Ramaswamy to cut government Departments, Divisions and Agencies, it will be white people who will come to realize, that the majority of people who work in those Departments, Divisions and Agencies are white people, as well as it is white people who in the areas as administrative, semi-professionals, professionals and various technical skill who rely on government jobs, government contracts, government grants and government program services.

The public often look at government programs and since Reagan they try and focus on black people, but reality is, as the numbers show, it is,

When I bought my Q7, it tried to kill my wife twice in the same day. Emergency Left Turn Crash Avoidance misfired and activated without obvious cause in the first 3 miles she drove it. Then, once parked at home on the same drive, she accidentally activated the rear hatch by foot swipe and it pinned her against the back of the garage, and she wasn't strong enough to force it closed due to the angle and position it put her in. 

She wouldn't drive ""That Fucking Kraut Wagon"" (As she so eloquently put it on the day of the incident) for the better part of a year. She eventually came around and drove it a few times, but it was only out of necessity. I put almost 100k on that car, and she likely had less than 100 of them as a driver. 

So, my advice, just grin and bear it. She might come around, might not. If you like the Rivian and she likes the Tesla then you got a workable solution. Now, if you bought the Rivian for her to drive, well I sure hope she had lots of input. Otherwise, be prepared to have that brought up often, and a new solution found soon. I've made that mistake as well.

No crime took place, no laws broken. The 'evidence' is just a *feeling* that Musk was too involved. A *feeling* that the board didn't negotiate hard enough. A *feeling* that certain board members might not be objective enough.

I don't like the idea that my pay package could be voided because a judge in another state *felt* that my boss didn't work hard enough on negotiations.

>they needed to approve a new pay package rather than approving the old defective one.

'Defective' is again just a highly subjective opinion. There was nothing wrong with it and there's no way to prove otherwise. If people *want* to pay you X then X is, by definition, the right amount. That's how markets work.

But ok, so if the package needs to be different to the old one, what would say if the shareholders decided that the previously agreed upon package was too small? The performance targets were beaten so maybe they should increase it?

>I don’t think you understand the legal system very well

Well you're right there.

>I seriously doubt you have read either opinion at all

You're spot on there as well. I hadn't seen it linked anywhere in the reporting. But you make a good point so I went and [found it](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=359340). It's, well, troubling..

The very first sentence reminds readers that Musk is the ""world's richest man"". Which instantly adds negative framing out of the gate.

It goes on to say the package is ""250 times larger than the contemporaneous median peer compensation plan a"" but what contemporaneous plans exist? Only seven companies have higher market caps so comparisons aren't exactly readily available. 

Musk owns \~13% of Tesla which is worth around $150b. Less than Zuckerberg who owns \~13% of Meta which is worth \~$200b, and inline with Warren Buffet with \~15% of Berkshire at $150b.

And these are the only three examples in existence of a trillion dollar market cap company where the founder/CEO owns more than 10%. 

So I find the idea of it being inherently unjust because it's rare to be nonsense.  Of course it's rare. 

The opinion continues with, ""This decision dares to “boldly go where no man has gone before,”"". So that's reassuring isn't it, the quoting of Star Trek.  And we get ""Musk was the paradigmatic “Superstar CEO,”"", weird.

Then we get Musk ""enjoyed thick ties with the directors"". Sorry but how often is the CEO, who is on the board, *not* 'thick' with other members of the board? How is that even defined? What is the right and legal amount of ""thickness""? 

  
""Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla’s behalf. He had a 15-year relationship with the compensation committee chair, Ira Ehrenpreis. The other compensation committee member placed on the working group, Antonio Gracias, had business relationships with Musk dating back over 20 years, as well as the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis.""

The shareholders know who is on the board and know their histories. That Musk knew these people, had histories with them, and were on occasion friendly, was not surprising news. If it was the second vote might have gone differently but it mirrored the first which should have send a clear message.

I don't have the time to read 201 pages of this just to argue in a reddit common so I'm going to close out by saying Musk is a deluded twat and the board should replace him, however, I'm an old school traditionalist who thinks a deal is a deal and you should get paid for services rendered.",-0.30000001192092896,18.799999237060547

In der Nacht zu Samstag wurde bekannt, dass der Tatverdächtige Taleb A., ein Arzt und Psychiater aus Saudi-Arabien, der seit 2006 in Deutschland lebt, offenbar ein Islamfeind ist, der Angela Merkel den Tod wünschte und schon seit 2016 öffentlich seine Unterstützung für die AfD bekundete.
>
>„Das ist die Wahrheit über den saudi-arabischen Terroristen, der heute ein Auto in den Weihnachtsmarkt in Magdeburg gesteuert hat“, beginnt Naomi Seibt noch in der Nacht ein Video auf der Plattform X (ehemals Twitter), das bis zum Samstagmorgen schon mehr als 1500‑mal verbreitet wurde. Die 24‑Jährige aus Münster hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren nicht nur in Deutschland einen Namen als rechtsextreme Influencerin gemacht. Ihre Videos und Posts sind meist auf Englisch, richten sich an ein internationales Publikum. Für Ruhm und Reichweite sorgt vor allem, dass auch X‑Chef und AfD-Fan Elon Musk Seibts Videos an seine 208 Millionen Follower verbreitet und auf Posts der jungen Deutschen antwortet.
>
>Was also soll laut Seibt die Wahrheit sein über den mutmaßlichen Täter von Magdeburg? Nichts von dem, was die „Mainstream-Medien“ erzählten, passe zusammen, behauptet sie.
>
>„Dieser Mann war ein Migrant, der nach Saudi-Arabien ausgeliefert werden sollte, aufgrund eines Antrags der saudi-arabischen Regierung selbst. Die deutsche Regierung hat das aber verweigert“, sagt Seibt. Dabei bezieht sie sich auf unbestätigte Angaben saudi-arabischer Twitter-Nutzer und Influencer. Seibt betont: „Das wäre nicht passiert, wenn die AfD an der Macht wäre.“ Grenzschließungen und Abschiebungen, wie von der AfD gefordert, hätten die Tat verhindert, behauptet sie.
>
>Dabei kam Taleb A. gar nicht als Asylbewerber nach Deutschland, überquerte auch nicht unerlaubt die deutsche Grenze. Aus Interviews, die A. vor einigen Jahren der „Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung“ und der „Frankfurter Rundschau“ gegeben hat, geht hervor, dass er im Jahr 2006 im Rahmen seiner Facharztausbildung nach Deutschland kam, anschließend als Arzt in Deutschland arbeitete und erst 2016 einen Asylantrag stellte, weil ihm im Falle einer Rückkehr nach Saudi-Arabien eine Tötung wegen seiner Abkehr vom Islam drohe. Aufgrund seiner Beschäftigung als Facharzt hätte A. jedoch wohl auch ohne den Asylantrag weiter in Deutschland leben können.
>
>Seibt verbreitet auch das Gerücht, A. könne insgeheim ein saudischer Agent gewesen sein, mit dem Auftrag, abtrünnige Saudis und Ex‑Muslime in Deutschland auszuspionieren. Ob das stimme, sei am Ende gar nicht relevant, erklärt die rechtsextreme Influencerin. Für sie ist klar: „Dieser Mann war ein Migrant, der nicht hier sein sollte. Das ist alles, was zählt.“ Zum Schluss des dreieinhalbminütigen Videos ruft Seibt dann noch zur Wahl der AfD auf.
>
>Weniger Stunden später antwortet Elon Musk mit nur einem Wort auf das Video: „Wahr“.
>
>Was Seibt beiseitezuwischen versucht: Taleb A. hatte in den vergangenen Wochen gleich mehrere ihrer Posts und Videos verbreitet, teilte ihre Ansichten zur Politik in Deutschland offenbar. Auch erklärte er über Jahre hinweg mehrfach seine Unterstützung für die AfD. (...)
>
>Ähnlich wie Seibt argumentierten am Samstag auch AfD-Politiker und rechtsextreme Onlinemedien. Der Thüringer AfD-Landessprecher Stefan Möller schrieb auf X: „Klar, die Mainstreammedien bemühen sich natürlich, den Mörder von Magdeburg als AfD-Anhänger darzustellen. Aber wir erinnern uns schon, welche Politiker & Parteien ihn ins Land gelassen haben? Das wird nämlich perfiderweise nicht erwähnt.“
>
>Und das rechtsextreme österreichische Portal „Report24″ legt gar nahe, Taleb A. könne insgeheim auch ein Islamist sein, der sich bloß als Ex‑Muslim tarnt.
>
>Schon kurz nach der Tat – und lange bevor der Hintergrund des Tatverdächtigen bekannt wurde – hatten Rechte und Rechtsextreme am Freitagabend begonnen, Falschmeldungen über die Todesfahrt von Magdeburg zu verbreiten und sie für ihre politischen Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren. (...)
>
>Ebenfalls schon kurz nach der Tat riefen Rechtsextreme zu einer Demonstration am Samstagabend in Magdeburg auf.

Lets say you invested $4000 on Friday..

$2000 you put in a big cap like Tesla. It went up 5%. 

$2,000 would buy you 4 full stocks at the low of $420 with 5% gain you make $72.52 from your 2,000 investment. Your $2,000 is now worth $2,072.52

$2000 you put in small cap that hit the scanner on Friday called WKEY.

It opened at $3.30 and closed at 7.84 it did a 140% gain during market hours due to news about SpaceX.

Lets say you didn't get the low, you bought as it ran say for $4.50..

$2,000 but @ $4.50 would get you 444 shares. Your $2,000 is now worth $3,480.96 Even not catching the full ride you got something like a 75% gain vs a 5% gain..

The past few years we have went 100% EV. Buying and servicing vehicles is 100x easier and cheaper via the likes of Rivian and Tesla verses the tradition model of Ford, GM and Toyota.

We were heavily buying Tesla for a two year period (until Elon started showing his true colors) and we are using Rivian as a replacement. We chose Rivian over legacy brands simply because the sales and service model is so much better. I actually quite like the GM and Ford EVs themselves, but I loathe the dealership networks.

Instead I can go online, select the exact vehicle and configuration I want and get it delivered to my door much the same as buying off Amazon.

What exactly do you mean by this? Stelantis only has 2 EVs for sale in the US which is kinda of pathetic, no one wants a crappy Fiat 500e in the US. 

I think the Charger EV has some demand, but not at a >70k price point, even over 50k is hard to swallow when you look at the 0-60 and 1/4 times compared to a Tesla performance trim that will cost ~50k brand new, ~30k lightly used.

Obviously theres a growing demand for EVs as people like not paying hundreds of dollars per month on gasoline and needing multiple trips to a dealership for maintenance per year.

Though we have to be a bit realistic and honest here and admit all this recent spike in interest in h1bs, a topic that has remained quiet in all ""the good times"" is purely due to the change in interest rates and big money panicking about innovating as they add useless feature #43849842 on iphone #29389283042384 while everything gets more and more expensive and companies are able to nickel and dime much less from the consumers, while markets are saturated, leading to panic and now this last ditch effort of AI, and thus jobs tightening and Americans left feeling the effects of it and then taking it out on the scapegoat of legal immigrants, specifically a very small portion of 0.5% of the workforce. 

Elon is a twat, but he is correct about one thing, that h1bs did infact make America prosper till where it is today. The article in this post, which of course decided to go with the inflammatory headline for obvious reasons, even mentions another viewpoint:

> Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, said the new research is noteworthy, but would like to see more studies on the issue.

A good balance should be reached. I agree the low quality scammy h1b shit should be done away with, but those are low paying jobs, jobs I'm sure Americans do not desire as much. The highly paid h1b jobs are the only focus of the drama here. But if everyone is talking about bringing in much higher qualified immigrants, then they'll of course demand equally high pay.

Climate change got worse, impacting farmers. The Supreme Court was packed 6-3 Republican, which doesn’t match the 50-50 makeup of Americans, so half of America is unrepresented in the judiciary. 

Yearly deficit overspending which was trending down doubled. The national debt increased by $8 trillion, almost as much in 4 years as in 8 years of Obama — more than any previous president in history — and this despite a strong economy.

Overspending and bankruptcy is what caused the fall of the USSR from the Cold War.

I cannot tell if this is a real guy or a bot. His account history is strange, and his name is the whole 'ad' thing but was only created in 2020? Maybe I need to just not care about such things? Sooner or later, I'll just treat everybody as a bot until they stand in front of me. Of course, don't blame me: it's a known fact that about 80% of the Internet is not even real. It's all fake info and bot accounts. The moment bots get smart enough to look human, we won't even be able to tell based on language structure, account name, and otherwise. 

(I know Musk looked under Twitter and found the whole thing was rigged, even though Jack said it wasn't and lied in court. And we know about 80% of Twitter accounts were bots. We know also China spends something like 3 billion dollars a year on anti-American propaganda and bot farming. Billions. Just on America. That's remarkable. The 'dead Internet theory' is also quite powerful, indicating most forums are false or not real people. And we also know most comments come from the same people using one or more accounts, so the amount of traffic does not even equate to vast numbers of people. Again, Twitter found that only a small number of users accounted for most of the comments left, since they would comment 1,000 times a day or whatever. Throw A.I. into the mix and rigged websites/searches, and you have yourself a very broken, closed, controlled system. Check out Google's 'nudge theory' to see how they actually push and maintain this sort of structure from Google's side. It's horrible, and as it stands, I find Google almost unworkable. YouTube doesn't even give me results I want anymore. The whole system is run on popularity, tags, and ads and other factors, not the literal search prompt, which is how it used to work more so. And half the generic channels I do see are not even real: the script is A.I.-generated and/or the voice is A.I., and the comment section either doesn't know or doesn't care.

This is clearly a problem for video games and game design in general, such as A.I. art, but also beyond that now with A.I. NPCs in video games, and endless bots in online games, which has been the case since the 2000s, of course.)",-0.4000000059604645,15.899999618530273

Dan nog alfa Romeo die van stellantis niet de funds krijgt om een echt mooie auto’s neer te zetten de Giulia en stelvio zijn de laatste alfa’s die nog emotie en een ziel hebben.

There is an administrative state, which is part of the government and it is not in shadow.

There are oligarchs and special corporate interests such as the MIC that heavily influence our government, some of those actions are “shadowy” but it is not a “shadow government”

I have come to believe that certain elements relating to the phenomenon and aspects of the MIC operate in the shadows outside of the controls of congress but this is better described as rogue government elements, not a shadow government.

Shadow government implies that there exists a separate and fully confidential government body that makes the true societal decisions while the gov we see is a show gov. That’s not true.

And it's what makes someone like Musk even worse -- he's characterized as a capitalist, and people think, ""If this is capitalism, then no thanks!""   
  
Note that, personally, I don't use ""mixed economy."" Socialism = public ownership/control, capitalism = private ownership/control. (Nominal) private ownership but public control has a name: fascism. So, that's the term I use.",-0.20000000298023224,3.4000000953674316

What happens if their revenue drops 90% to $45M?  80,000 layoffs, the company becoming unstable, etc.  Honestly, they'd just fire-sale.  Their free cash flow is $9B.  They would survive about 2 months on that.

> The research, production, transport etc stays exactly the same, The example you gave with Musk's handling of Twitter was that he just chucked out a heap of people doing actual work there

You can make an argument that the most important innovations occur from the top of the class and you may be right but we dont have a good way to quantify all of that. Additionally, even if you said that was true you get to the problem of how do you actually identify the best engineers.

This also doesn't make sense even on an immigration numbers level the top .1% of engineers in the world if they are able to be identified can already get work in the United States because there are already so many H1B1 visas approved.

It just takes some sort of weakness to change the narrative and the biggest opex ever to cause this price action. Voting machine breaks around these big opex as calls disappear. It's going to be potentially even bigger jan opex and after earnings and IV crush.

We're still above last ATH and the last gamma squeeze peak, but still really expensive on any valuation metric. Make no mistake, Tesla is doing amazing things that I'm excited for. That's why I'm happy paying a high P/E multiple for the megacap company. 

FSD is great but there's still videos of them doing not great stuff occasionally. It's still a long way from any significant robotaxi like revenue and earnings. 

Tesla has made $2.4 EPS in the past year (this will change next month). At 100 P/E (which is still high for any megacap company) that's a share price of $240. If it does happen, it won't go straight down of course. Look at any past gamma squeeze and see what happens if/when the positive narrative changes.

We should bounce short term for any potential hype for P/D but also realize what you're being hyped for. We beat estimates hooray, but it's flat to barely positive YoY. Earnings are also likely going to be flat to barely positive. There's going to be hype around FSD and geofenced robotaxis but even if they do millions of miles next year somehow, it doesn't really move the revenue and earnings needle.

Once again, I'm excited for the things Tesla is doing and why I'm giving TSLA a good P/E of 100 as a realistic/moderate bull. If I was truly a bear, I'd be like gojo with a P/E of 10-20. Just know what you're willing to pay for actual performance or hype and your investing time frame. If Tesla does accomplish everything, it'll be at this level or much higher. But everything has to be in place for that to happen. How long will that realistically take? 

If you have shares and willing to hold forever until that happens then all of this concern doesn't matter. Options are riskier since IV is still high and are time limited. If it doesn't hit your strike or IV crushes, calls will lose a lot of their value or go to $0.

If you're depending on TSLA for your retirement or the money actually means something to you, that's when hedges can make sense. If the thought of your portfolio and TSLA hitting $240 (or lower if there's an actual bear market) makes you feel nauseated and changes your financial future, why not hedge it? If you're ready to be retired now, why not secure that future and be sure you're able to stay retired? You'd just cap your net worth potential at being rich instead of really rich soon. Through compounding you'll still get to really rich with time.

I made a lot of money in 2021, past my fatfire numbers and got greedy. Lost a lot of it in 2022 using leverage thinking it has to bounce sometime and had to go back to work to stabilize my family's finances. Once I got back to my chubbyfire numbers, I secured my family's future through hedges. Was it too early to maximize gains? Absolutely. But TSLA can go to $700 or $100 and I'll still be fine this time around. This is why personal finance is personal and no one can make the decision for you.

We may FINALLY get a look under the cover during the next four years.

I’m a student of propaganda.  Like the movie “They Live”, I see these control measures everywhere.  With the internet is it FAR easier to control people who outsource their thinking to places like NYT, Fox, MSNBC etc.  I refuse to watch any of them anymore.  I refuse to be a member of either party.  They have consultants who know just how to get people mad, and if you keep them angry enough, they come back for more.

During the last four years you had both overt and covert censorship of social media.  The government had its thumb on Facebook, Twitter, Google, et al.  The “Twitter Files” released after Musk took over demonstrated as much.  That was censorship on a massive scale.  Speech was either outright curtailed or “chilled”.  Without free speech we are nothing.  I may not agree with you, but I’ll defend your right to say it.  Once you lose free speech, you lose it all.

During Covid the government drummed up hysteria (yes, they used consultants no less) was used to try and violate bodily autonomy.  What happened to “my body, my choice”?  Out the window because bureaucrats wanted something.

There’s a strong possibility that much of what you believe is at best only half wrong due to propaganda.  Some of it is all wrong.  Been there.  Believed the Bush WMD bullshit.  That’s when I learned more about propaganda.  Now, unless I “do my own research”, I readily accept almost nothing.  Certainly very little from “official sources” that are now allowed to actually propagandize you of the part of government.  (Obama signed that legislation).

I can sit with you through a MSM political show and I’d have to stop the tape every minute just to point out the weasel words being used to influence “the narrative”. And the narrative is whatever benefits the donor class, primarily big pharma and the military industrial complex.

When you get exorcised over something, you’ve already been groomed by others for that to be a hot button.  I was there, I was one.  Now I wear the sunglasses in “They Live”.

Back when we had “Occupy Wall Street” and “The Tea  Party”, I was a fan of both.  The two political parties marginalized them both.  Not because their ideas weren’t good, but because they were “bad for business”.  Obama had a once in a lifetime opportunity to revamp Wall Street and punted.  “Bad for business”.

I’ve done something I doubt anyone else on this platform has bothered to do— I watched every old video of Trump I could find on YouTube in 2015.  You know what?  Everything he was saying then on the campaign trail was no different than anything he said in the proceeding two decades plus.  It was all mainstream Democrat positions.  Yet all of a sudden he was evil.  Why?  They couldn’t control him so he’s “bad for business”.

I wish I had saved a copy of the chart of spending by big pharma on all the networks.  If Kennedy gets that banned, all those multi-million talking heads are gone.  So Kennedy is “evil” and a bad pick because he’s “bad for business”.

It goes on and on.  As I like to say, we have the best government money can buy.  Unfortunately you and I can’t buy it, and those who a via lobbyists get what they want.

If the incoming administration acts anything like the last one I’ll be calling them out as well.  You may not agree, but I believe the last one had on a path similar to one party China.  That’s not a good path at all.

Finally, I leave you with clips from the recent Andreesen interview with Rogan.  If what he’s saying doesn’t scare you, you don’t value freedom.

There are literally millions of people who grew up with similar wealth but there is only one Elon Musk. You can be lucky once, but when you have 3 or more major successes it’s lazy to just attribute all that to just luck. 

A wildly successful business doesn’t need just technical competence and capital, it needs somebody with a vision and a drive to get there. 

Each of Musk’s major companies are disrupters that pushed an industry in ways that weren’t done before. It’s not necessary to be the technical top dog to make that happen, you need to be the one who pushes the technical and marketing people into doing something extraordinary or to be the one who recognizes a whacky idea as something with potential and be willing to sink millions or billions in them. Many of those ideas will be duds, but some of them won’t.

>Buying into the system? Your 'reformed' tax proposal is just a poll tax. Societies have been using poll taxes for hundreds of years. It's one of the most regressive types of taxation which is why society has almost universally stopped using it to tax income. There were literal revolts to abolish poll taxes as far back as 2000 years ago. 

I will admit I am not an economist, but I'm a history major, so I actually have plenty of knowledge here. In general, equally taxing people pisses some rich people off, while unequivocally taxing people pisses the poor people off. It is a cycle in history, but the rich people get pissed they can't get more rich while the poor people get pissed they can't afford to live. Guess which one I have sympathy for? But to actually comment directly on your point here, while this is true, it also ignores most of history. It's a cherry picked point. If you'd like, we can break down all of the revolts in history caused partially or fully by wealth disparity :) The stats won't be in your favor though.

>Clinical trials of the Russian cancer vaccine will begin in mid-2025, said scientist Alexander Guintsburg, director of the Gamaleya National Research Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow. These trials will involve “patients with oncological diseases”, while the vaccine is currently being tested in mice as part of pre-clinical research.

[Here's all the relevant context you need to know](https://xkcd.com/1217/).

Real scientists have noted there's no paper or raw data available.

According to politicians of greater caliber than Putin, cancer has been cured many times. Like, once in every national politicians' term.

Nixon was the first US President I'm aware of to declare a ""War on Cancer.""

[Another story](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/coming-soon-a-cancer-vaccine-for-free-courtsey-russia/articleshow/116433827.cms?from=mdr)

>“Now it takes quite long to build \[personalized vaccines\] because computing how a vaccine, or customized mRNA, should look like uses matrix methods, in mathematical terms. We have involved the Ivannikov Institute which will rely on AI in doing this math, namely neural network computing where these procedures should take about half an hour to an hour.”

[This is the Gintsburg talking there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Gintsburg). Dude is 73 years old. AI is magic to him. And AI is truly impressive, but he's just regurgitating a bunch of buzzwords he doesn't understand. 

""Matrix methods"" and the mention of neural networks seems designed to spark the interest of dumb tech bros or maybe just Elon Musk. 

The hard part of any vaccine, let alone a cancer vaccine, is not something that can be done on a computer. 

I've designed a bunch of vaccines in sequence analysis programs. It takes way less than half an hour even without AI! It's not hard for someone with a minimal bioinformatics background (which is not Gintsburg). You can do that work manually in microsoft word and it will take you not that much longer.

PROVING it works is the hard part. Even GETTING to the stage of proving it is very tough. You can't use computers to do that, you need to use cells, flesh and blood mice, larger organisms, and then humans.

There's absolutely nothing scientific going on here whatsoever. 

Publicly identified US scientists speaking on this are still speaking scientifically and cautiously, that's the academic way of not making strong statements because crazy things happen. 

And honestly, maybe a lot of them realize if they outright say ""This is the dumbest fucking shit I've ever seen and everyone who takes Putin statements at face value is too stupid to understand anything about science"" then Musk is going to cut their funding.

That's where we are now with Republicans in charge. Real scientists are being censored and fake science news is soon to be pumped out on US state media like Twitter and Fox news, because dumb oligarchs like Musk are full of dunning-krueger and are too dumb to realize they're fucking idiots.",-0.10000000149011612,11.300000190734863

8+ people to go where? Modules that could support that many people would be very expensive to develop, let alone costs per year.

>And assuming that SLS B2 happens (this was unlikely before Isaacman was selected as the administrator), how in the world would it end up a billion dollars cheaper than B1b?

Also Jared [seems](https://x.com/rookisaacman/status/1713213698557333976) to have a negative attitude towards the SLS cancellation. Also, Jared doesn't have the means to cancel SLS - he needs congressional approval, which there's no way he'll get. The SLS has escaped cancellation many times. Musk doesn't like the SLS, but I'd be surprised if his romance with Trump lasts until late next year.

Also, the only major differences between SLS Block 1 and 1B are the replacement of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage with the Exploration Upper Stage, along with the replacement of the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter with the Universal Stage Adapter. Then the only major difference between Block 1B and 2 is the replacement of the upgraded Space Shuttle SRBs with BOLE boosters. 

EUS and BOLE should not be terribly expensive compared to their ""predecessors"" - since the integration costs of older hardware are prohibitively expensive.

Also the SLS work will be transferred to the DST LCC, after Artemis IV or V I think, and is expected to reduce SLS costs. Plus after Artemis V an annual SLS launch is expected, which will then become 2 launches per year, and through economies of scale there should be some reduction in SLS costs.

>Also you can utilize lunar ISRU with a starship HLS, just refilling lox gives you more than 150t of additional payload capacity to the lunar surface.

Starship V1 can put 27-50 tons of cargo into LEO. The V2 that the HLS will likely be based on will most likely be capable of more. What 150 tons? And even if it does, what exactly will weigh more than the 10-15 tons that will need to be transported to the Moon's surface?",-0.20000000298023224,5.5

1) To tax someones full net worth you’d need to tax unrealized gains on assets which would be insane because many people would have to liquidate those assets (stock, land etc) to pay the tax on the appreciation of the asset(s) making it almost impossible to accumulate wealth.

2) there’s no guarantee the unrealized gains of your assets are always going to go up… if you were to tax Elon on his stock holdings  (companies he built from the ground up working 80 + hour weeks) then if his stocks go down the next year do you pay him for his losses? Do you tax him less? Do you only tax him for years where there is an increase in value and ignore general net worth? 

If you have a good idea, are willing to take huge risks and work hard to make ideas reality you’re entitled to the benefit of that work. If you’re not entitled to the fruits of your labor then why would anyone take big risks and work that hard? 

Take a house for example; if you took a risk, bought a house, spent countless hours fixing it up and the home appreciates in value would you feel comfortable paying tax on that appreciation? Especially if you know in the back of your mind that the bottom could feasibly fall out of the housing market and you could be underwater on the home next year.",-0.30000001192092896,5.099999904632568

Let me answer your original question. I personally think they’re switching sides because, multi-billion dollar valued corporations have a financial obligation to their shareholders to increase the value of their shares. They’re going to get tax cuts, realistically regardless, but they’re guaranteed under the Trump administration, and thus the line will go up. They know who butters their bread, and as long as that line continues to go up they’ll have a job. 

Musk is going to get insanely more wealthy and ensure his products have zero market competition so of course he’s all in, but he’s also a silver spoon brat like Trump so I’m willing to bet he’s a true believer.

I don’t even really buy that they’re switching sides, the tech corp campaign donations were pretty even across the board between the DNC and RNC for 2024. Let’s be real, they’re getting paid no matter who’s in charge, as they’re practically untouchable monopolies that own copies of nearly everyone’s, including any would be regulators, private data, and that’s a hell of a lot of power to have. I think these people are ghouls, sincerely. I don’t trust them to better society, and I’d like to see them trust busted and broken up. 

Good thing for me I scroll past and pay zero attention to any and all of the targeted advertising they throw my way. They definitely have my data though (who doesn’t these days), so I guess you’ve got me there.

Dampened micro servos aren't cheap. Might be cheaper than assembly line where they use existing robotic arms preprogrammed. I just have a hard time understanding how they will get the computing power requirements small enough without a bunch of h100 server clusters. 

Are people expecting a massive software boost or jump in the microelectronics, like light based computing? Battery density is an issue too. They could be training and ai model with the hardware vis remote operators but how many tops is needed to run this tech? I've got some basic machine vision ai in coral tpu and waiting for frigate to get hailo8 nvme ability. That's 27tops. Low power server is probably 50w or more. Will 2.4kwh be enough. My CNC router would use that up in 30 minutes. I'm reading 500w when walking. 

I'm guessing they will be assembly line tethered first. And a server farm for compute power. I hope to see the day of much more autonomous bots but we need a lot of advances which probably will come.

Trump can probably pull some dangerous E.O.s but, at the rate their going, Republicans may not have the numbers to pass any substantial legislation via spending bill, which is how things get done at this point.

Mentira deslavada. O vírus não sai do organismo de ninguém isolado, sai sempre em gotículas de saliva, contra as quais as máscaras são eficazes. Sabemos desde 2020, BEM ANTES DO PICO DA PANDEMIA, que as máscaras funcionam.

>Os tais e-mails da Pfizer era eles tentando vender antes de sequer estar pronta e não era usado enm regulado em nenhum lugar do mundo

Ninguém no seu campo político entende o conceito de encomenda?

>a compra foi feita após a Anvisa aprovar e que era necessário isso e o Brasil foi um dos primeiros países a receber a vacina com diferença de menos de 2 meses.

1) Dois meses que representaram mais de CENTO E VINTE MIL MORTES, porque isso aconteceu entre dezembro de 2020 e fevereiro de 2021, quando morriam em torno de 2000 pessoas por dia.

2) Não houve esse delay quando os caras que trabalhavam para o Pazuello quiseram negociar a Covaxin. Eles foram atrás antes mesmo de a vacina indiana passar pelos Testes Clínicos, nos quais a vacina da Pfizer já estava na Fase IV (que é a fase onde a distribuição em massa já é realizada). Por que eles foram atrás? Por causa daquela denúncia, que saiu até no relatório da CPI, de que havia uma propina de US$ 1,00/dose de vacina; essa propina não tinha sido oferecida pela Pfizer, daí o desinteresse.

3) Brasil só teve vacinação em massa antes de outros países porque nosso SUS tem parâmetros que figuram entre os melhores DO PLANETA. Ou seja, a vacinação aconteceu não por causa do Bolsonaro, mas APESAR DELE.

>O ministro ele demitiu pq era a favor de lockdown e já está provado tbm estatisticamente que lockdown não ajudou em nada nenhum país

E pra comprovar isso você não me manda um único e mísero Artigo Científico, mas sim uma publicação de um Think Tank, aquele pessoal que É PAGO PRA PUBLICAR O QUE INTERESSA A QUEM TÁ PAGANDO. No caso, quem paga é aquela galera que tava isoladinha, trabalhando de casa (porque CEO e bilionário pode, né?) e, principalmente, LAVANDO A BURRA ENQUANTO MORRIAM MILHARES DIARIAMENTE.

>A única coisa que ele fez de errado foi a maneira como falava sobre, pois ele não tem filtros e não tem capacidade nem de explicar o que acredita (creio que todas opiniões eram de alguém que dizia para ele mas ele não sabia explicar).

A parte mais engraçada é saber que o Bolsonaro tava fazendo tudo certinho até ir pros EUA e encontrar a turma do QAnon por lá em meados de março/20; diziam que ele tinha voltado doente, inclusive, lembra? Quem ditava as porcarias que ele tinha que falar era o Trump, o Musk ou o Bannon?

Therapists : ""we don't accept insurance because they don't pay us well enough and plenty of well off can pay cash.""


Mental health providers may not accept insurance for a number of reasons, including: 


Low reimbursement rates


Insurance companies typically reimburse mental health providers at lower rates than other providers. For example, a therapist may bill an insurance company $200 for a session, but only get reimbursed for half of that. 


Dealing with insurance companies


Therapists may find the process of interacting with insurance companies to be a hassle. 


Shortage of mental health professionals


There is a shortage of mental health professionals, especially in some parts of the country. 


Demand for therapy


Demand for therapy is high, and some mental health professionals may not accept insurance because they can get paid out-of-pocket by patients. 


Providing better care


Therapists may choose not to accept insurance so they can provide better, more personalized care without the limitations of insurance companies.


First insure at least the mentally ill, then tell the Therapists that people's health is more important than a brand new tesla. 


It all comes down to money, people don't become doctors to help, they become doctors because of the paycheck.


Makes you wonder how many have committed these acts, that could have gotten help, maybe even offerd help, but didn't get it because they couldn't afford it.

mainstream and social. All about money again, couldn't give a shit less about people's wellbeing.

I agree with your opinion that driving 8 mph around a mannequin isn't ""recklessly swerving"" as it is called in this video, and it's a good call-out that an inanimate sliding dummy is going to look different to an ML model trained on actual pedestrians.

My personal assessment is also that (in Tesla's tests) the car in the other lane is there to prevent the vehicle from going around the dummy, because the test was intended to verify that the vehicle would stop when given no other option. The theme of the other videos in the collection was also around stopping, not just going around obstacles.

""Team Trump doesn’t seem happy about all this mockery and talk of Musk’s power. In a post on Thursday to the social media platform he owns, Musk [tried to downplay claims he](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869518723482341880)[’](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869518723482341880)[s running the Republican ](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869518723482341880)[P](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869518723482341880)[arty](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869518723482341880), despite his hourslong tweet storm slamming the bipartisan deal House Speaker Mike Johnson had struck. And Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt [issued a statement to multiple media outlets](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/19/trump-musk-johnson-cr-00195477) on Thursday, trying to quell the “President Musk” talk and insisting that Trump is still in charge of his party. 

“As soon as President Trump released his official stance on the \[continuing resolution\], Republicans echoed his point of view,” Leavitt said. “President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party. Full stop.”

But if your spokespeople are having to issue public declarations that no, really, you’re the one in charge, then it’s only because that isn’t as obvious as it should be. Needless to say, Musk is not *actually* president (and under the Constitution, as currently written, he can’t be, as someone who isn’t a natural-born citizen).""- [https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/president-musk-donald-trump-spending-bill-rcna185083](https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/president-musk-donald-trump-spending-bill-rcna185083)",-0.4000000059604645,7.300000190734863

If you want the best team, you need to pull the best talent from wherever it is, including overseas. Even if Americans are generally ""better"" at these tests, if the guy who scored the highest is Nepalese, why wouldn't you want him?


I hate Trump and his weird cult as much as anybody, but I must admit it seems many people will reflexively assign the worst possible motives to any idea coming from the right just so they can enjoy the dopamine hit of ripping on that idea. All this about ""they just want more people to exploit,"" and all that, when nobody has said anything to suggest that.


It seems clear Elon Musk is the one leading this charge. He is petulant, self-absorbed ass, but he is also an immigrant who is heavily invested in STEM, so although I don't doubt he *could* have shitty and selfish motives, it frankly seems at least as likely in this situation that he just genuinely believes bringing talented immigrants into difficult fields is the best path toward success. 


And that's all a very reasonable position, except that it's coming from someone most people don't like, so we need to work backwards and find a reason to shit on it.

3. end the carried interest deduction. Get rid of the inherited stock price reset tax dodge for billionaires (people like Musk never sell stock, they live on loans, their kids inherit the stock and reset the price to the current price, so no tax is every paid).  reduces the deficit

4. Get rid of our commercial medicine infrastructure that takes huge money out and has worse outcomes than similar countries (shorter lives, vastly more spending on health care).

I’m sure engineers felt that way before Apollo 1 and 13, before Challenger, and Columbia. 

It’s simple hubris. 

A lunar descent will eventually fail. And without a crew abort capability, the astronauts aboard will be left to contemplate the genius that went into such a decision that is about to kill them. And they will think of their families, of their children who are about to lose a parent, of a spouse about to become a widow(er), of friends who will mourn. 

Interestingly, none of the engineers making such decisions are the ones with their lives on the line. Later, unlike after Apollo 1 and 13, as happened after Challenger and Columbia, many will rationalize that the decisions they made that cost those astronauts their lives. They have that luxury. 

There is no defensible reason not to give a crew going down to the Moon the same courtesy we give astronauts on a launch pad, a chance to live another day if something goes wrong. Heck, Cirrus and several other general aviation companies put ballistic recovery systems on their planes at no small cost to try to keep the pilot and souls aboard alive in the event of an accident. So that means we should take the trouble, time, and money to ensure a crew abort capability during lunar descent and ascent. 

This is an engineering debate, not a pro/anti-Elon/SpaceX debate. Try, please, to look at the risk tree as an engineer should rather than one trying to put lipstick on the pig that is the current HLS requirement for abort.",-0.20000000298023224,7.099999904632568

Besides all that…. he has manipulated public opinion only for his own benefit. Millions of people believe he was being investigated and indicted as a result of some devious plot by the democrats. For god’s sake, look at the actual timeline of the events leading up to his first indictment. Look at the insurrection at the capitol and all the scheming and corruption that was happen behind the scenes. He wasn’t indicted to interfere with his campaign. His campaign…the announcement a full 2+ years before the next election (there’s a red flag) was interference with ongoing criminal investigations. And he wasn’t indicted to being investigated because he is actually a bad person who was breaking laws and corruptly trying to stay in power after losing. 

He did lose, too….by a landslide with the lowest approval ratings of any modern president. For those who forgot all that and were fooled enough to vote for him again?

Trump has appointed musk to form an private sector “non-governmental agency” that informs the other 66% of government to completely hobble/destroy the protections that keep shithead employers from f*cking you over, companies from causing earthquakes from fracking, superfund sites, etc. etc. his intentions are to enrich himself by being above the law. It’s absolutely fair to bring up any counter points on democrats or whatever, I’ll probably agree with them—it’s just through this you’re getting defensive over a politician, and it’s evident that you believe he’ll save you.

There was a CR that was negotiated on for MONTHS! Then Elon tweets about it and what? The democrats in the house will not even fight for it? Even if it’s going to fail, it was agreed upon by both parties and should’ve been brought to the floor. They had no fight in them, and then the third CR is clean and has no debt ceiling changes, but it still wasn’t the first one. Every time! The democrats bail out the republicans. If the republicans can’t get their crap together then why should they get help?

In the end ive always thought that both Democrats and Republicans are equally capable of believing stupid conspiracy theories.

People in general are just stupid and oppose things because it's the other team.

Good things can come out of his next term but I have reason to be skeptical. He was a gun grabbing president who banned bump stocks and is definitely no Libertarian like Ron Paul.

Tell me....when Trump gets in office, do you think that he'll end the Patriot Act? Will he undo every gun ban in existence that he can? Will he defund the Military to stop the Military Industrial Complex? Will he abolish the FBI, CIA, NSA, ATF, or IRS, even *one* of them? Would he end the FED and go back to the gold standard?

Will he do a single thing that I mentioned? Likely not. And he's chummy with WEF Member Elon Musk. He originally wanted to appoint Larry Fink (Blackrock CEO) as his Secretary of Treasury.
