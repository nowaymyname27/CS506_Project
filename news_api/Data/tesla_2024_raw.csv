Erin Hooley/AP                               The Arctic air gripping much of the U.S. put Tesla drivers in Chicago into a pickle on Monday. Many of the cars sat in long lines at Supercharger stations, their owners saying the cold sapped the electric vehicles' normal ability to charge — and keep a charge.   In some cases, tow trucks were called to move the cars, in scenes that were relayed by local TV news. The Tesla owners' plight became an emblem of the misery extreme cold is inflicting on wide sections of the U.S. (more on that below).   Tesla owners line up, hoping to get a charge   ""I've been here for over five hours at this point and I still have not gotten to charge my car,"" Tesla driver Brandon Welbourne  told CBS News Chicago , as car horns blared nearby. ""A charge that should take 45 minutes is taking two hours.""   Other drivers spoke about how the cold seemed to drain their batteries more quickly than normal.   On Monday, the local National Weather Service office recorded  a rise to 1 degree Fahrenheit at Chicago-O'Hare Airport at 1 p.m. local time, adding, ""This means that Chicago's climate site spent about 35-36 hours below 0°F.""   The challenges Tesla owners are facing aren't specific to the carmaker. Lithium ion batteries, which are used in everything from smartphones to the Model S sedan, are notoriously susceptible to cold, particularly when temperatures are  below freezing .    Anyone who has seen their phone's charge indicator sink when they walk out into frigid air, only to rebound when back inside, has seen how cold can impair the batteries.     Other Tesla drivers report no issues   Christine Maslan, who lives in the village of La Grange, west of Chicago's Midway airport, tells NPR that she drove her family's Tesla for around 80-100 miles on one cold day this week.    ""No struggles with starting or charging but I charged at home in our garage,"" said Maslan, who moderates a Facebook group for Tesla owners in Chicago. ""We do get less mileage on the battery in extreme temps which means we have to charge more often"" in the cold, she added.    The problems that are being reported this week seem to center on long lines at Supercharger stations, Maslan said. But she adds that in nearly 10 years of owning a Tesla, she's never had to wait for a Supercharger slot.   Other than being mindful of the potential for reduced range, she concluded, ""I've never had a problem driving the car due to the cold.""   To cope with extreme cold, Tesla recommends keeping the vehicle plugged in, and maintaining a charge of at least 20%.   Tesla has tips for drivers in the cold                   Enlarge this image                            Tesla owners in Chicago say the intense cold is making it difficult to charge their vehicles.

Huh/AP                               In Tesla's  Cold Weather Best Practices  guide, the big takeaway is to prepare your car to charge in extreme cold.    Some steps, such as defrosting the car and setting the cabin's climate before attempting to drive, will also warm the battery. And when it comes to charging in the cold, the company recommends letting the car prepare the battery to take on a charge.   ""Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate to a charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before arrival to ensure optimal Battery temperature and charging conditions,"" the company says in its  Model S owner's manual . ""If the drive to the charging location is less than 30-45 minutes, consider preconditioning the Battery before driving.""   Some cold-weather considerations are more unique to Tesla.    ""For example, odorless steam can come from the front of your vehicle while charging at a Supercharger in cold temperature. This is normal and not a cause for concern,"" the company says, explaining that it's a function of the heat pump  on some models.   It can also be tricky to open the door on the Model S with a drained battery. Under normal circumstances, the car automatically adjusts the windows to ease the process.   ""Always connect to an external, low voltage power supply before opening a door when the vehicle has no power,"" Tesla says, ""to avoid breaking a window.""   Ice and snow storms, from coast to coast   Last month's mild start to winter is now but a memory: People on the East Coast and West Coast are seeing freezing rain, snow and other winter precipitation, and many people in the middle of the country are in the grip of an Arctic airmass, according to the  National Weather Service .   In  Chicago  and elsewhere, schools have been closing and libraries have been opening as warming centers, as towns try to hunker down and endure the cold.   People in  Washington, D.C., and Baltimor e are being told to brace for the coldest day of the year so far. In New York City, the NWS reported more than an inch of snowfall in a single day on Tuesday,  breaking a 701-day streak .   In Colorado, dangerously cold and snow conditions forced some highways to close, and many large school districts remain closed on Tuesday, according to  Colorado Public Radio .   Looking ahead, there's good news and bad news.    The middle of the week will bring a slight break from the Arctic air, forecasters say — but a new surge of Arctic air will dip down into the Plains states and Deep South later in the week."

Are Older Tesla Model 3s Ticking Time Bombs for Maintenance? - CleanTechnica,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQVk0tWm1NQk1rcE9PZHZMc29uRzhRVjNVT0FFaXJZQUNGUGxncHFlcnRhM0JoaU1fa05KMzhpblR4VlRsVWJibVk2YjhfTUR4a1RfNU90WHRoQWtucF9PUEMyQVlJeWNjSkFOeFJhYS1QWThlV2pOd01zS3RienlIWjMteVZUMTJMRm5qNWZPY1RPaXJyRkwxUTBaZURIQdIBowFBVV95cUxOdlJDbkZHNG0tNGlkNFZyWEljSTJEdERzY0Z2Y3lSam5aQWEzYzZOVUtzNU9xUF9qYTBsS0Z3OUJZU0swV3BXbWdyLXgwbXRkTm9iMThlM3Y1RFlOLS1KdkVBMkd0LTlYYXNhRnFRSVIwNXhzZ1VTNE8zTzhPV3FiYkNKYmoxd3hvQl9FQXlJQkJNb2sydnJHamIzdHMwV3o5N2JR?oc=5,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 12:42:12 GMT","Sign up for  CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries , sign up for  our daily newsletter , and/or  follow us on Google News !       I’ll admit it — I’m approaching this topic a bit selfishly. I have an “older” Tesla Model 3, and I’m on the lookout for long-term ownership concerns. I was scanning the Tesla Motors Club forum and the headline “Is my beloved 2018 LR Model 3 turning into a maintenance $$$$ nightmare?” grabbed my eye. As the owner of a 2019 Model 3, what issues do I have to watch out for that this 2018 Model 3 owner is experiencing? I’ll get to that in a moment, but let’s first just put some context into the age of the Model 3 fleet.       The line graph and bar chart above show that  2018 Tesla Model 3s are a very small percentage of all the Model 3s sold to date  (around 8% of all Model 3 deliveries). Even adding in the 2019 units, we’re at a small percentage of the world’s Model 3s (maybe about 20%). Being some of the oldest versions of the car, keeping an eye on issues they develop may help us predict what issues newer Model 3s will have in a year, in two years, or in 5 years. ( Can you believe the model is more than 5 years old?!? )   On the other hand, Tesla is constantly changing things and improving models, whether they come with a big named refresh or not. The following chart shows  cumulative Model 3 sales over time , but there are all different versions of the Model 3 captured in that sea of blue.     So, that’s part of the challenge — one can’t know if common issues with a 2018 Tesla Model 3 will matter to a 2019 Model 3, or if common issues with a 2019 Tesla Model 3 will matter to a 2020 Model 3, and so on. At the same time,  some of the issues  must be warning signs for newer Model 3 owners as their cars age.   Getting to  the thread  noted above, the key parts of her post are as follows: “I took delivery of my silver model 3 in June of 2018. During the warranty period a number of issues were addressed and they were always issues that people were discussing on this forum. Tesla mobile service took care of them all efficiently and I loved my model 3. Until recently it’s the best car I’ve ever owned and I can’t tell you how many photos I’ve taken of it. I even named the damn thing.   “Fast forward to a month ago, and the power conversion system (PCS) module on the battery goes out and needs to be replaced. Total bill was around $2500 for that. I figured well, if I divide that by the number of years I’ve owned the car, that’s like $500 a year so not bad. Then last night it throws the RCM_a056 “Front passenger safety restraint system fault” which I have seen others discuss on the forums. Online estimate for this repair is $1700. (!)”   Regarding that first matter, the PCS, another commenter noted, “The PCS failures on the 2018 vintage cars are a known weak spot unfortunately. Now that yours is fixed you should be good to go.” So, it seems that is an acute issue for early Tesla Model 3s and those of us who own newer Teslas shouldn’t fret. (Let’s hope! But good news there for now.)   The second matter is an interesting one. One commenter noted they had the same problem when the windows were left cracked and a lot of rain got in. Once dried out, the error went away. The original poster said later that she found out (after some interrogation) that her husband had spilled water on the seat on the way home from the gym. She dried it out and the error warning is gone. A third commenter posted the following:   I hope your issue was the water spill. Mine is also a light silver December 2018, and I got that error after about 3yrs, and the error seemed triggered by seat position. If I moved the seat up, it would start erroring. So, the SC replaced the connector harness which could get stretched. Then a year later, I got the errors again, and they put an OCS filter on it, which I think shields it from electrical interference.   Then a month ago, it started erroring again, so I’m scheduled on Wednesday to get the seat sensor replaced and the airbag as well. Under warranty, since I scheduled the service just before the 5yr SRS warranty expired, plus, I guess I have a history of this problem.   Oh, I forgot to add that if I put a 40lb bag of pellets on the seat, I don’t get the error. I don’t know if that’s good or bad or whatever; but I found the constant alerts to be annoying. I thought it wasn’t really a safety issue because I never got alerts if someone sat in the seat, so I put a 40lb bag on it, and no alerts.   So, an issue to look out for? More likely to be a simple sensor issue than a costly repair? Who knows, but try to keep your seat dry, and if you do get the error, investigate for waterlogging.   Owner forums are known sources for issues. Spending a lot of time on any auto forum will convince you the brand or car the forum is dedicated to are full of maintenance and reliability problems. In the case of Tesla, independent research has indeed found reliability issues over the years, particularly with early model years of a new model. So, I think it’s prudent to keep an eye out for issues. However, it’s also the case that most owners won’t have many serious issues for years. Here’s one more helpful comment to counterbalance the concerns highlighted above:   We’re in the SF Bay Area as well, have a 2018 M3 LR with exact same mileage 34K (34,1XX to be more exact), but was born in Feb 2018 so about six months older. Literally has never had any service or repairs, save the retrofit of HW3/cameras included with FSD, and a couple of mainly preventative 12V battery replacements.   Another relative’s 2018 M3 LR was born in Sept 2018, same as yours, but not driven so much only 11K miles. A piece of loose exterior trim replaced the first month, and otherwise also just a couple of 12V replacements (with onscreen warnings, I attribute to their garage being in hot summer climate).   We did have a Model S that had a few minor repairs, most under warranty. But I was just thinking this morning, driving in today’s rain with new tires and wipers recently put on, how reliable and trouble-free our M3 has been; and our relatives too, esp for being 1st year production run of the Model 3 (ours is in the 1st 5000 by VIN). Maybe we’re just statistically lucky, but it gives me great confidence.

"I rented an EV from Hertz. I'm not surprised they're dumping 20,000 electric cars. - Business Insider",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPSlFxM1Z6R1N6ZVYxUDlBTWZaZlZ1YlZLdjVGVFZvWWZxTlVyMnkzN3pudVRSY1ZkcnJpaEsyTTA1S2RnQ0pPRXJDNEZDY0FGR05HcHN6UnJGUVMwQUE3NzVXc3hLYlVtakwzT053Yjd3eXZySFpwc3d6ck0zUVE1MjQ4bGtwcVpDWU1EQm5WUllfdmFHQ2c?oc=5,"Thu, 11 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Jan 11, 2024, 12:30 PM ET         This story is available exclusively to Business Insider                 subscribers.  Become an Insider                  and start reading now.   Have an account?  Log in .         The first 24 hours in my rented  Tesla  Model 3 from Hertz were rough.   Once the battery was finally charged to 100%, things got easier.   I'd rent a Tesla from Hertz again, but I see why they're ditching so many of their electric vehicles.          In my first few minutes inside a Hertz waiting room in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I quickly realized I wasn't the first person here to try test-driving an  electric vehicle through a rental service . One of the men in front of me was asking the rep about his options — a  Tesla , a Volvo, a Chevy. He wanted to know what set each car apart, what each one looked like, and what the pricing was for each. When the worker went to the back to look for something, the man turned to someone nearby and explained he really  hated Elon Musk  and didn't want to rent a Tesla if he didn't have to. A conversation in the waiting room followed, with a spirited debate (well, as spirited as a bunch of polite Midwesterners get) about the pros and cons of Elon Musk and Tesla. After that, it was my turn to pick up my  Model 3 . I thought the employee might find it amusing after all the Tesla talk in the waiting room — but he wasn't fazed. He must do tons of these a day, I figured. The experience that followed reflected some of the headaches that may have led to Thursday's decision by  Hertz to sell off 20,000 EVs  from its fleet, citing higher costs to service and repair.         That’s when the first hiccup arose.         A Hertz counter similar to the one I visited in Ann Arbor, Michigan.                                            Chris Hondros/Getty                                              The physical credit card needed for my booking was on the other side of town. My fault for not reading the  fine print  and assuming I didn't need the card if I had paid ahead of time, and also not a dealbreaker. When I came back 40 minutes later with the credit card, it only took a few minutes to complete the transaction and have the Model 3 pulled around. I was prepared to get a walk-around of the car or maybe some kind of quick run-down on  how to use an EV or how to charge it . Instead, the Hertz rep handed me the Tesla key card and sat back down at his desk. I sat there for a moment before turning around to see my Model 3 parked out front. ""Oh, there it is!"" I said. And I walked out to the car by myself.           Luckily, this wasn't my first time driving a Tesla.         Interior of a Tesla Model 3 Hertz rental.                                            Nora Naughton                                              Because I'd driven a Tesla before, I already knew how to  tap the card to unlock the car  and get in. I'm not sure a first-time Tesla driver would know that off the bat. For what it's worth, Hertz did email me some  instructional videos  about my Model 3 a few days before I picked up my rental. I found it buried in my inbox after I had the car, and these videos did help me quickly troubleshoot issues such as adjusting my side-view mirrors. My reservation quoted me about $56 a day — about what I expected for a fancier car during the holiday season. In total, my five days came out to $261.30 once taxes and fees were added in.           The first 24 hours were a struggle.         My Tesla Model 3, dirty from winter roads in Michigan, sitting at a Supercharger.                                            Nora Naughton                                              When I got in the car, instructions on the touchscreen told me to press the brake and tap the key card on the center console. Once my Model 3 was ready to drive, I immediately checked the range, and my heart sank: Hertz had given the car to me with only 53% battery. I knew that  in the Michigan cold , that wasn't going to last me very long. I needed to find somewhere to juice up before I could start putting the Tesla through its paces. ""Oh, well,"" I thought, ""A small setback."" A Hertz spokesperson told me the company strived to have batteries at 80% for pickup, so it seems my experience was an oversight.           But as soon as I pulled out onto the salty Michigan roads, a new problem arose.         A dirty windshield in a Tesla Model 3.                                            Nora Naughton                                              The second I pulled onto the road,   cars kicking up salty water quickly dirtied up the massive windshield of the Model 3. I went to hit the wiper fluid and immediately got an error message on the touchscreen: ""Wiper Fluid Low."" Nothing came out of the sprayers. The wiper fluid wasn't just low; it was empty. ""Ok,"" I thought, getting a little more annoyed. ""Add that to the list with charging."" Between the delay getting my car and the lack of charge, I decided to scrap my errands for the day and head home. I had dinner plans that night and needed to get home and change.           Cold weather and a busy first day meant I spent a lot of time chasing range.         One of my many stops at Tesla Superchargers during my five-day rental.                                            Nora Naughton                                              I made two visits to  Tesla Superchargers  that night in order to keep enough range in the battery to get me where I needed to go — never with enough time to get up to a full charge. It was inconvenient but not prohibitive to my plans. Still, I wondered: What if I were a more typical rental customer, and this was the first day of a trip in which I had a lot of ground to cover? This could derail travel plans in a way half a tank of gas really couldn't. On the first stop, I charged for 15 minutes — as long as I could wait without being rude to my dinner host — to go from 35% to 40%. I left my house with 39%, so this trip was kind of pointless in the end. On my way home from dinner, the second stop was an hour long and only got me up near 60% battery. I got home after midnight.           The next day, I made a trip to pick up wiper fluid         Tesla Model 3 frunk and a jug of wiper fluid in a CVS parking lot.                                            Nora Naughton                                              About 24 hours after acquiring the Model 3, thanks to a quick stop at CVS, the car was finally comfortable to drive, and the battery was at 100% charge. I could have asked for reimbursement for the wiper fluid when I dropped off the car, but I decided the $20 wasn't worth a back-and-forth with customer service. In the end, it's still a rental car.           The remaining four days were smooth sailing.         The Tesla Model 3 rental in my driveway.                                            Nora Naughton                                              Hertz had sent me a video with instructions on how to use my Model 3 that helped me get through some little learning curves, and the free charging at Supercharger stations (so long as you return the car with the same level of charge you got it with) certainly saved me money. I had to charge four times in the five days I had the car. Dropping off the car at the end of my rental was also quick and seamless. I just parked, dropped the keys at the desk, and was on my way. Overall, getting started on renting a Model 3 from Hertz was bumpy and there are definitely simple improvements that could make the transition into the car more comfortable. Simply having 100% charge and a full wiper-fluid reservoir at pickup would have made all the difference in those first 24 hours. These little things are especially important as Hertz reckons with how to keep EVs in its fleets. My sometimes rocky experience renting an EV is proof that — from customers to employees to Hertz itself — there's still a lot of learning to do when it comes to electric cars. Even with these issues, I'd definitely rent a Tesla — or another EV — from Hertz again. A lot of the issues I encountered can be chalked up to one-off issues during the busy holiday season or the fact that I was renting from a smaller lot. I think what surprised me the most is how regular the experience is once the car is fully charged and you get used to things such as  one-pedal driving . Even when you're renting a Tesla, it's still just a rental car. And Hertz is still just Hertz."

""Due to a lack of components, we are forced to suspend vehicle production at the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg between January 29 and February 11, with the exception of a few sub-areas,"" Tesla said in a statement.   The company blamed the component shortage on shifts in shipping routes caused by  the crisis in the Red Sea , where Iranian-backed  Houthi militants  have been attacking ships in solidarity with the Palestinian militant-Islamist group Hamas, which is  fighting Israel in Gaza.   ""The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are also having an impact on production in Grünheide,"" Tesla said. Why are shipping firms suspending routes in the Red Sea? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that  supports HTML5 video   Red Sea crisis   The US electric vehicle maker is the first company to announce an interruption to output due to the disruption. Many companies, including Geely, China's second-largest automaker by sales, and Swedish home furnishing company Ikea, have warned of delays to deliveries.   The attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants have forced the world's top shipping companies  to avoid the Suez Canal , the fastest maritime route from Asia to Europe. It accounts for about 12% of global maritime traffic.   Shipping giants such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have been sending their vessels on longer, more expensive journeys around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The extra route adds about 10 days in a journey from Asia to northern Europe and about $1 million (€910 000) in extra fuel.   ""The considerably longer transportation times are creating a gap in supply chains,"" Tesla said. The company has been manufacturing electric cars in Grünheide near Berlin since March 2022, with around 11,500 people employed there.   dh/sms (dpa, Reuters)"

Not Even Tesla Can Dodge the EV Sales Slowdown - Business Insider,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxONG5iUmJxSktMd01iM0RxeWFUNjEtX3RSaUoyV0hhRmgydF91NFdXSkdwMHliUTVMU1BKeGJYb1hIYW93QmZHNEczdUl6TTlQQWJsRE1taExnQkFLdGFWZTBMSVFWLUl6OFowUmdOYWsyQmFETW51UkE2WVVKUnJQZWhJZDRCcWxPbk85djRFMU1fdw?oc=5,"Sat, 27 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla  just confirmed the market for electric vehicles really is slowing down. Elon Musk  warned a slowdown in sales growth was coming when Tesla reported earnings on Wednesday. Or, as the EV maker tried to dress it up to investors, the company is now ""between two major growth waves."" Tesla had some pluses to report, churning out almost 500,000 vehicles in the September to December period.  Vehicle deliveries last year jumped 38%  to 1.81 million. But that wasn't enough to stop the warnings. Revenue growth slowed , up 3% to $25.2 billion after years of breakneck expansion. Now, the outlook appears to be dimmer amid flailing demand. Tesla embarked on an aggressive price-cutting strategy in 2023 that reduced the prices of everything from the Model 3 to the popular  Model Y by more than 25%  to spur interest. Investors did not like what Tesla had to say, pushing its share price down more than 10% on Thursday, wiping more than $50 billion off its value.                              Tesla Model Y.                                                                     SOPA Images/Getty Images                                       But against a backdrop of sharply higher inflation and interest rates, focus has been increasingly directed towards  a cheaper mass-market EV  from Tesla. One problem: it's not likely to arrive anytime soon. The ""next-generation"" sub-$25,000 vehicle will enter production in the second half of 2025, Musk said. That's  several years after it was first touted  — and reminiscent of the four-year gap between the Cybertruck being announced, and actually being delivered. Meanwhile, competition from  China's BYD  has become a major threat. The Warren Buffett-backed EV maker, which sells its vehicles in more than 60 countries and recently overtook Tesla on global EV sales, put an early focus on affordable models such as the $10,000 Seagull.                              BYD has found success through more affordable offerings such as the $10,000 Seagull.                                                                     WuYuan/Getty Images                                       Chinese automakers pose such a threat that they could ""pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,"" Musk claimed, ""if there are no trade barriers established."" Taken together, it explains why  Tesla  explicitly said sales growth would be ""notably lower"" this year – making it just the latest car maker to confront the wider slowdown in the developed world. Although a record 1.2 million EVs were sold in the US last year,  per data from industry research firm Kelley Blue Book , a slowdown beyond Tesla is very real. EV sales surged 40% year-on-year in the last three months of 2023 —a ""strong result by any measure,"" as the industry research noted. However, it's lower than both the 49% rise in the third quarter, and 52% increase in the last three months of 2022. Aran Waid, senior analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said growth in EV sales globally was continuing but that it had ""fallen short of automaker expectations."" ""High inflation and interest rates have also impacted sales last year, particularly in Europe, while individual countries have also been reducing financial incentives,"" he said. Growth is happening then, but at an increasingly slower pace in a phenomenon that's hitting pure-play EV companies like Tesla, as well as traditional automakers. Ford, for example, said this month that it's  cutting production of its F-150 Lighting truck  due to poor sales.                              Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup.                                                                     Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images                                       General Motors, meanwhile, said in October it was  scrapping a target to produce 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 . CEO Mary Barra said the company was ""adjusting to slowing near-term growth.""                              Related stories                                      Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know               Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know             Perhaps the clearest sign came when car rental company Hertz announced that it was selling some 20,000 EVs, citing higher repair costs as an issue. Tesla does have some advantages in the slowdown. As my colleague Nora Naughton notes, it can afford to keep cutting prices thanks to  cost savings it gets from manufacturing. There are plenty of markets too that Tesla can target for rapid growth in the future, such as Japan. ""We should at least have a market share proportionate to, say, other non-Japanese carmakers like Mercedes or BMW, which we do not currently have,""  Musk said Wednesday. Selling more cars in a country like Japan won't come easy. Part of the challenge, Musk said, lies in a ""lack of awareness"" about Tesla in a nation very well served by its own automakers, such as Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, and Nissan. Meanwhile, the challenge of getting its mass-market vehicles on the road next year is likely to be monumental. As Musk said: ""We really need the engineers to be  living on the line ."""
Tesla warns of growing competition from automakers in China - Automotive Dive,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQakY1OC1UbTg3Tm5lZllNdUs5UkhieUlEU2ZsV1liQTlHM2JKUzhhNEliX2Q4NG5fcS0xUGdoSjFVbFlNaFFuRl9MbHE0aG9UcTRjME5YWHBlRldKTWxfbDFwSWZLUTc5U0V1ZGFkVHZpdExnVTg0anpDdDZqRFV5MXc5WkNqcXlDNFlGOFNEQU95ZkZKNUo0WmtCRXYtQXZ2TXN5Q1NweEFORkQ4TGI1Smk1WjhOVHVleExF?oc=5,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Listen to the article          4 min                          This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have  feedback .                During Tesla’s earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk warned that looming competition from automakers in China could make it increasingly difficult for the company to compete in the electric vehicle market. BYD has already emerged as one of Tesla’s biggest competitors worldwide, having  surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest seller of electric cars  in the fourth quarter of 2023.   “I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world. I do emphasize that it is not an easy path and a very difficult one,” Musk said.   He predicted automakers in China could become dominant in the global EV market without tariffs or trade barriers in place.   “Well, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world,” Musk said. “I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”   High interest rates could also make it more difficult to sell as more consumers grow concerned about costly monthly payments, Musk said.   “People are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla,” Musk said. “If the interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good. And if they don’t come down quickly, they won’t be that good,” he said.   But an affordable mass-market car, which Musk confirmed is under development, could help Tesla remain a dominant player in the EV segment. Tesla’s next-generation platform might help the company boost sales and improve its finances, as the company has cut production costs as much as possible for vehicles like the Model Y and Model 3, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said during the company’s earnings call.   “Predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few,” Taneja said. “While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.”   Tesla’s next-generation EV is expected to cost around $25,000 and will be built first at Tesla’s Giga Texas plant, with production starting sometime in 2025, Musk said.   However, Taneja warned that the company’s growth may stall in 2024.     Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Automotive Dive free daily newsletter     “There will be periods where we won’t be growing at the same rate as before,” Taneja said. “We are between two major growth waves. The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform.”   Tesla’s finances took a hit last year, as the automaker slashed prices to boost sales in an increasingly competitive EV market.   On Wednesday, Tesla announced its Q4 earnings increased 3% year over year, rising from $24.3 billion in Q4 2022 to $25.2 billion in Q4 2023. However, its operating margin dropped from 16% in Q4 2022 to 8.2% in Q4 2023, a 7.8% YoY decline. Likewise, the company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization fell 27%, from $5.3 billion in Q4 2022 to less than $4 billion in 2023.   Those same trends were also reflected in the automaker’s yearly earnings. Tesla reported $96.8 billion in 2023 revenue, a 19% YoY increase. But the automaker’s operating margin fell from 16.8% in 2022 to 9.2% in 2023, a 7.6% YoY decline. Moreover, its adjusted EBITA fell 13% YoY, declining from $19.2 billion in 2022 to $16.6 billion last year."

The world’s richest person, whose No 1 status is endangered by the  Delaware  ruling, held a poll on X asking whether Tesla should change the company’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. With more than 1m votes cast, the poll recorded 87% in favour of moving. Responding on Thursday, Musk wrote on his X account: “The public vote is unequivocally in favour of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to  Texas .” On Tuesday, a Delaware judge called a 2018 share-based package awarded to the  Tesla  chief executive “an unfathomable sum” that was unfair to shareholders, and struck down the arrangement. Soon after, Musk wrote on X: “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” He added: “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters”. Musk has strong ties with Texas. He moved Tesla’s corporate headquarters from Palo Alto in California to the Texas city of Austin in 2021 after criticising California’s regulations and taxes, and also clashing with health officials at the start of the Covid pandemic over reopening a factory in Fremont. One of the carmaker’s gigafactories is in Texas and it is building a $1bn (£800m) lithium refinery in the state, aiming to produce enough battery-grade lithium for about 1m vehicles by 2025. Other Musk companies, including the rocket firm SpaceX and the tunnelling business the Boring Company, also have operations in Texas. Another Musk-related Texas expansion is under way at X, which he also owns, after the social media platform announced last month it would open a content moderation office in Austin with 100 staff. It was not immediately clear whether the Tesla board supported Musk’s X declaration on Thursday. The Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick in  her ruling  on Tuesday, wrote that Musk, a 13% shareholder in Tesla, had “thick ties” with the directors negotiating his 2018 package and had “dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan”. Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College law school, said moving to Texas “will require the board to initiate the reincorporation.” He added: “So, if he hasn’t he should drop them a line because it’s supposed to be a board call, not the result of a poll on X.” Quinn said switching to Texas would not change the underlying law behind the Delaware ruling, but the state’s launch of a new business court means it will want to show the court is “a fair forum for the adjudication of business disputes.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s putting Texas in a bit of a bind,” he said. Two weeks before the Delaware ruling, Musk challenged the board by writing on X that he  needed to own 25% of Tesla’s voting shares  or else he might build unspecified artificial intelligence and robotics products outside the company. Musk is worth $202bn, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index, more than the luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, on $183bn, and Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, on $180bn."

Revenue and profits missed analyst expectations over the three months ending in December, according to the earnings report released on Wednesday. In all, the company delivered 1.81 million cars in 2023, more than it had in any previous year, the earnings report said. However, Tesla has  cut prices  as it faces increased competition, putting downward pressure on the company's revenue. Further, the company's vehicle delivery growth ""may be notably lower"" in 2024, Tesla said in the earnings release. ""Tesla is nothing more than a struggling car company,"" Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, told investors in a note Thursday reviewed by ABC News. For its part, Tesla said the slowdown owes to the company's focus on developing a ""next-generation vehicle"" that will arrive as soon as the second half of 2025. That improved vehicle will supercharge sales, the company said. ""Our company is currently between two major growth waves,"" the earnings report said. ""The first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform."" The explanation, echoed during a conference call Wednesday, failed to allay the concerns of Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, who is typically bullish on the company. The conference call, Ives told ABC News in a statement, amounted to a ""trainwreck."" Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, June 16, 2023. Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters, FILE The earnings report has shaken the ""near-term confidence"" previously endorsed at Wedbush, Ives added. ""But we remain firm on a long-term bull thesis around Tesla and the broader AI story set to take hold,"" he added. Tesla CEO Elon Musk drew attention last week when he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he's seeking greater voting control of the electric carmaker, threatening to otherwise pursue major projects such as artificial intelligence outside of the company. The Tesla board, Musk said, should grant him 25% voting control, an amount that would nearly double the vote share currently afforded to Musk through his stake in the company. The company has also faced government inquiries over risks posed by some of the technology in its vehicles. In December, Tesla agreed to  recall  about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. Earlier this month, the company recalled an additional 1.6 million vehicles exported to China, citing a problem with the car's assisted steering system. The uncertainty that looms over the company, Ives said, amounts to a ""bitter pill to swallow for the bulls."""

The alliance now enters maturity and provides critical mutual benefits and an example to the EV industry.   Tesla and Panasonic continued a long partnership despite the issues stemming from high demand in recent years. After developing the 4680 battery cell technology with Tesla, Panasonic decided to introduce an improved version of the 2170 battery cells for the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y in 2024 or 2025. According to Bloomberg, the Japanese giant plans to expand battery capacity and improve productivity without investing large amounts of new facilities. The aim is to quadruple production capacity by 2030, benefiting Tesla, its main ally in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.    The new plan includes:     Increasing the energy density through fewer cells.   Thus reducing manufacturing costs.   Resulting in an overall price drop for Tesla.      Panasonic, which holds around 10% of global battery output in the EV market, also seeks to reach a capacity of 200 GW/h per year by early 2031 from the current capacity of around 50 GW/h.  Yet, Panasonic is cautious about new production facilities, as the electronics and battery giant refused a $700 million incentive package to build a plant in Oklahoma.    Panasonic has a plant in Nevada and is building another one in Kansas to produce  2170 battery cells . The $4 billion project is expected to end up with an annual capacity of 88 GW/h. In a statement to Reuters, Panasonic Group CEO Yuki Kusumi said that the company put the idea of a third factory in the US on hold as ""demand for EVs cools."" Kusumi said that Panasonic will decide on a third plant ""when the timing is right,"" pouring water on the concerns of thousands of jobs vanishing.   Panasonic first started supplying Tesla with the 18650 type battery cells, later supplied 2170 type cells, and developed 4680 cells with Tesla. The long and arduous journey had some setbacks, but now, with increasing capacity and solidified alliance, Panasonic amplifies production in Japan and the US. The evolution of the Tesla - Panasonic partnership was crucial for allowing Tesla  price cuts  and making Tesla the  top BEV seller  in the world. Now, this partnership is more important than ever in the  EV battleground .     The history of the Tesla - Panasonic partnership    The ties between Tesla and Panasonic go deep. In 2009, only one year after Tesla released its first-ever car, the  Tesla Roadster , two companies signed the first initial supply agreement. One year later, the Japanese giant moved to tighten its ties and invested in $30 million worth of common stock Tesla. In 2011, the partners entered a fruitful era of business by signing a supply agreement for automotive-grade lithium-ion battery cells for 80,000 electric vehicles (EVs) to be built over four years. Under the agreement, Panasonic guaranteed the supply of enough battery cells to catch up with Tesla's rapid growth and make the pre-ordered  Model S  ready.    Following the success of Model S, launched in 2012, Tesla and Panasonic expanded their partnership in October 2013 with Tesla to receive around 2 billion battery cells over the next four years. Tesla announced that the lithium-ion battery cells will be used in Model S and  Model X ; the latter was launched in 2015.    The next big step came as the announcement of the Gigafactory Tesla, in which the EV maker signed an agreement with Panasonic in July 2014 to build the giant facility in Nevada together. A marvel of its time, with a 35 GW/h capacity, the Gigafactory could have doubled the entire worldwide lithium-ion supply. To compare, we can look at the production capacity of leading countries in  2014 of Li-ion batteries :             Country   Capacity   Share in global output       Japan     2 GW/h   37%       South Korea   1.3 GW/h   24%       US   1 GW/h   19%       China   0.8 GW/h   15%             Under the agreement, Tesla prepared, provided, and managed the land, buildings, and utilities, while Panasonic manufactured and supplied cylindrical lithium-ion cells and invested in the equipment. As years passed, the two partners enjoyed a lucrative business like the Nevada Gigafactory (the second after the one in Fremont, California). Still, the demand for capacity increased without losing pace. In August 2018, Tesla said that the cell production capacity reached 20 GW/h, to reach maximum capacity by the end of the year.    Panasonic added three more cell lines to Gigafactory 1 (in Nevada) and brought to 13 cell lines by the end of 2018 to provide the expected supply.    In August 2020, Panasonic added the 14th line to Gigafactory 1 with an investment of $100 million, increasing the capacity by 10% to 39 Gw/h per year. Panasonic also said a battery upgrade is coming, resulting in a 5% storage capacity increase in each battery type.    Despite total effort from both sides, the more substantial wave of demands pushed Tesla to search for alternatives in addition to the Panasonic partnership. First, rumours appeared in late 2018 that Tesla was talking with Chinese Lishen Battery, but Tesla denied signing an agreement. Following this development, in January 2019, Panasonic also set out to seek new partners. It announced a partnership with Toyota to produce prismatic batteries, which formed a joint venture in 2020.    On the Tesla side, the EV giant acquired American start-up Maxwell Technologies in 2019 to apply their dry electrode technology to be used in 4680 battery cells. Nevertheless, Tesla never used the tech and sold Maxwell after integrating its ultracapacitor business into the company.           			Giga Texas. Image: Tesla.         'The crack'   As almost inevitable in a happy story, the Tesla-Panasonic partnership had its cracks, becoming apparent in April 2011, following a Nikkei report suggesting that Panasonic was about to stop production in Gigafactory 1 due to lack of demand. Tesla shares began to fall while the information on online media indicated that Tesla already had enough battery capacity to produce over 500,000 Model 3's per year, as Panasonic announced reaching the initial maximum capacity of 35 GW/h per year in March 2019.    Tesla CEO Elon Musk denied this on X (formerly Twitter), saying that Panasonic cell lines at Giga 1 are only around 24 GW/h capacity per year and limit the  Model 3  output. Tesla will need other partners and also won't invest in more capacity until Panasonic reaches maximum output (which eventually happened as the Japanese giant announced increasing capacity to 39 GW/h per year with an additional cell line in August 2020).    Eventually, the two old partners never let the well-established ties tear apart but pushed it forward to open a new page. Tesla received 4680 battery cell samples from Panasonic in 2020, and the latter unveiled its Tesla 4680 battery cell in 2021, with plans to pour $700 million into producing the new battery in Japan. Panasonic will continue improving the Tesla 4680 battery cell in 2024, while Tesla will have batteries in the Texas Gigafactory, which will be completed in 2022.    Things now look relatively smooth for Tesla, as the EV maker announced the 20 millionth 4680 battery cell production in Giga, Texas, in October 2023.

Gavin Newsom and Elon Musk at Tesla’s new global engineering and AI headquarters in Palo Alto on Feb. 22, 2023. Courtesy Office of Gov. Gavin Newsom. Seeking to accelerate Tesla’s plans to open its new engineering headquarters, the City Council approved a deal with the car giant on Tuesday, Jan. 16, to expedite an upgrade of a substation on Hanover Street. With little discussion and no dissent, the council unanimously supported a public-private partnership under which the city and Tesla would split the $24 million cost of replacing two transformers and adding substation breakers, a power distribution center and two 12 kV feeders. Under the deal, Palo A lot would pay $12 million for this work as well as an additional $3 million to transfer feeder lines that do not serve Tesla to the new transformers, bringing the city’s total share to $15 million. Utilities Director Dean Batchelor told the council that the partnership represents the best path forward for replacing equipment that he claimed would have to be replaced soon anyway. The department is now in the early stages of a $300-million grid modernization program that calls for replacing 4 kV lines throughout the city with 12 kV lines, a switch that would allow more residences and businesses to switch from gas-fueled vehicles and appliances to electric ones. Batchelor said that the Hanover Street transformers, which are located near Tesla’s new engineering headquarters at 1501 Page Mill Road, are nearing the end of their useful life. “We think this is going to be a really good partnership with Tesla, and we believe there’s no risk to the city by doing this,” Batchelor said. “If we were going to this on our own, we estimate we’d be spending somewhere around $18 to $20 million that the city would fund itself.” “By doing this, we’re saving about $5 million to $6 million in cost from this partnership.” Patrick Bean, Tesla’s director of charging and energy policies, called the deal a mutually beneficial way to increase the local grid capacity.” He said the company is planning to invest about $150 million in the new engineering headquarters, which formerly served as HP headquarters and which Tesla took over last year. As part of the deal, Tesla has already gone out to bid and selected a contractor to perform the work. It has also arranged for expedited delivery of all needed equipment. “The area is in desperate need for new capacity,” Bean said. “By taking up half the project cost as Tesla and 100% of cost to expedite, we ultimately think this is better for the community because we can bring it in at a lower cost than what would otherwise have occurred in the future. “This additional capacity will be available for other companies and customers to use. And we believe that availability of capacity will help drive further investment in Palo Alto just like what we as Tesla are doing.” The council voted 6-0, with Vicki Veenker recusing, to approve the deal (Veenker, an attorney, works with Stanford University on patent issues, and Stanford owns the land in Stanford Research Park that Tesla is leasing). Council member Greg Tanaka, who regularly votes against big-budget items, called the Tesla partnership “a pretty awesome deal for everyone involved.” “It seems like it’s something that we have to build, that we want to build, and we have someone who’s willing to pay for it, which is awesome,” Tanaka said. Meanwhile, the city is still planning for a broader update of the city grid, an effort that is expected to initially target overhead lines and then move to underground utility districts. The replacement of overhead lines, which make up about 70% of the city’s grid, is scheduled to be completed by 2027, while the remainder of the project is set to be finished by 2032, according to the Utilities Department."

Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla.

The Tesla board, Musk said, should grant him 25% voting control, an amount that would nearly double the vote share currently afforded to Musk through his stake in the company. The move would tie the company's fate even more closely to its high-profile leader, ensuring Tesla will develop  AI  in-house at a time when the technology stands poised to shape the auto industry and a range of other sectors, proponents say. Critics, however, caution of a risky precedent if the company's board were to comply with the request, empowering Musk in any future dispute with shareholders little more than a year after he sold a large number of Tesla shares to help fund his acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk and AI is a key to the future of Tesla,"" Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, who is bullish on Tesla, said in a memo to investors on Tuesday. Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Tesla owner Philip Benassi drives his car in Jessheim, Norway, Jan. 17, 2023. Petter Berntsen/AFP via Getty Images According to Ives, Musk currently owns roughly 13% of Tesla. Before selling shares in 2022 to fund the $44 billion acquisition of X, Musk owned about 22% of Tesla, Ives added. Musk, who co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but left the organization in 2018,  announced  the formation of a new AI company in July. The possible development of AI outside of Tesla would deliver a significant blow to the company's prospects, Ives said, citing the critical role of the technology in projects like full self-driving capability. ""If Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own company separate from Tesla for his next generation AI projects this would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story,"" Ives added. Ultimately, the board and Musk could reach a compensation agreement in as few as three months that leaves both sides satisfied, Ives said, adding that the move would ensure some viewed by many as a tech visionary would lead ""the new era of AI technology coming to Tesla."" Gary Black, managing partner at the Future Fund, who is also bullish on Tesla, echoed the sentiment in a  post  on X. ""Still plenty of time for the [Tesla] Board and Elon to come up with a new comp plan that properly aligns incentives,"" Black said. However, an agreement that expands Musk's stake in the company could embolden him to assert even greater control down the road. Such a prospect is especially concerning at a time when Tesla has weathered multiple product recalls and declining profit margins, Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, told ABC News. Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, June 16, 2023. Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters, FILE ""Musk is holding the company hostage,"" Johnson said. ""The prospects for Tesla are dismal,"" Johnson added, saying the demand from Musk offers him a pretext for departing the company. ""He sees the writing on the wall."" In December, Tesla agreed to r ecall  about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. Earlier this month, the company recalled an additional 1.6 million vehicles exported to China, citing a problem with the car's assisted steering system. The request for greater voting control suggests that Musk anticipates a substantial clash with shareholders over the direction of the company, Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, who is also bearish on the company, told ABC News. ""He's obviously worried about something,"" Irwin said. Further, Irwin downplayed the role of AI in the company, disputing the key claim made by Musk about his need for greater voting control. ""Tesla has done a great job with self-driving but it's mostly a misnomer and cake dressing,"" Irwin said. ""Is this an AI or robotics company? How much do they really have? In my view, not much."""

At the charging station near 95th Street and Western Avenue in the Evergreen Park area, many Tesla owners were stranded with dead batteries from the cold. Drivers said there were not enough working chargers at that location. MORE:  Frigid weather can cut electric vehicle range and make charging tough. Here's what you need to know ""Our batteries are so cold it's taking longer to charge now, so it should take 45 minutes, it's taking two hours for the one charger that we have,"" said Brandon Welbourne, a Tesla owner. ""I have seen at least 10 cars get towed away from here because the cars, they died, they've run out of battery. It's too cold, it uses too much of the energy to try to keep the car somewhat reasonable temperature, so everybody is getting towed away and we have nowhere to charge."" In the Oak Brook area, some drivers came looking for a charge and ended up waiting hours in the bitter cold. ""Right from outside the highway, there's a whole line of cars, about over 20 cars, all Tesla cars, and you can look around here, every single car is a Tesla car, full with Tesla cars this whole parking lot. And we're waiting and waiting for over an hour,"" said Sajid Ahmed, a Tesla driver. ""It's unfortunate that these cars are sitting dead in the spots."" For many drivers, it was too late. Their cars died during the long wait, and they had to leave their vehicles stranded and wait for the stations to get up and running again. ""I think just someone needs to come out here to make sure things are OK, because it's not OK,"" said another Tesla driver John Baldys. Tesla's support website  recommends keeping the charge level above 20% when not plugged in, which will reduce the impact of cold temperatures on the battery.

This marks a steady shift towards an electrified future as 1,189,051 new EVs were placed into operation. Estimates from Kelley Blue Book also indicated that in 2023, EV sales accounted for 7.6% of the overall vehicle market in the U.S., an increase from 5.9% in 2022.    Regarding volume and share, EV sales in the fourth quarter broke records, emerging at 317,168 units and 8.1%, respectively. And while there were new records, the often-reported downturn is true. By all measures, Q4 EV sales grew 40% year over year; nonetheless, this was not as significant as the rise of the industry’s prior quarters.    Furthermore, new data indicates that although adoption rates differed by state last year, the market for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the U.S. grew. According to data released by Cox Automotive, U.S. BEV sales achieved a significant milestone of 1.1 million vehicles in 2023.    Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s Director of Industry Insights, asserted that “2023 witnessed an increase in EVs despite facing several obstacles.” She further noted that “The demand for EVs is expanding. Although some new EVs vanished from the market, others remained for a longer period.”     In 2023,  Tesla  retained its position as the market leader for BEVs, selling 654,888 units in the U.S., a 25.4% climb from the previous year.    Other notable OEMs that experienced notable gains were Honda, which witnessed a 33% boost in sales from 2022, and  General Motors , which led the market overall with a year-over-year sales increase of 14.1%.    Considering both BEV and hybrid powertrains, the combined EV market share was approximately 16% last year. Cox anticipates that the share will increase to 24% in 2024 and to 31% in 2025. The industry is expected to welcome 70 new EV models in those years alone, which could assist in fueling the market’s ongoing increase in share."
"Pwn2Own 2024: Tesla Hacks, Dozens of Zero-Days in Electrical Vehicles - Dark Reading",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPMjRPcldBU0d2b3piQVFCeWJKR0l6MTh2cjVHR2d5SDkyWDQyUlNUVmlQZ0xpb2ZJWkRiZG44bDBVRnNtZ3Rxdk5lTzVJYlRGbnFpOUFJdjVRbkZsdWRaU213dkFUZnpldjY0WnRpdXAzVnRobS1DeW5IZEd2Y0xNblBJSFlReUtrYmxMLUx3WDZDNGVIRElNeVI5WQ?oc=5,"Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","In just two days at Pwn2Own 2024 in Tokyo, researchers have compromised a bevy of electric vehicle chargers, operating systems, Tesla components, and unearthed dozens of zero-day vulnerabilities along the way. Last year's Pwn2Own in Vancouver flirted with cars as an attack surface, adding Teslas into the mix alongside competitions to hack more traditional servers, enterprise applications, browsers, and the like. But this year's event went full pedal to the metal, and the results have been enlightening.  On the first day  alone, contestants demonstrated 24 unique zero-days, earning them $722,500 in winnings.  Day two  saw 20 new exploits, and the final, third day promises nine more still. ""Vehicles are increasingly becoming a complex system of systems,"" says Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness for Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), the group hosting the event. ""There hasn't been a lot of research into this area in the past, and based on our experience, that lack of external scrutiny means there could be a lot of security issues."" Hacking Into Teslas The headline-grabbing event at last year's Pwn2Own was when a team from Toulouse-based Synacktiv managed to  breach a Tesla Model 3 in under two minutes . This year, Synacktiv has returned with exploits of the Ubiquiti Connect and JuiceBox 40 Smart EV charging stations, the ChargePoint Home Flex (an at-home EV charging tool), and the self-explanatory Automotive Grade Linux. Its most notable achievements, though, have been a three-bug exploit chain against Tesla's modem, and a two-bug chain against its infotainment system, each earning a $100,000 cash prize. According to the rules of the event, vendors have 90 days to remediate their security flaws before they're allowed to be publicly disclosed. But in an email from Tokyo, the Synacktiv crackers gave Dark Reading a high-level overview of what the attacks looked like:  ""The attack is sent from a GSM antenna emulating a fake BTS (rogue telecom operator). A first vulnerability gives root access to the modem card of the Tesla,"" they wrote. ""A second attack jumps from the modem to the infotainment system. And bypassing the security features on this process, it's possible to access multiple equipment on the car such as the headlights, the windshield wipers, or to open the trunk and the doors."" With Teslas, says Synacktiv CEO Renaud Feil, ""it's a two-sided coin. It's a car that has a huge attack surface — everything is IT in a Tesla. But they also have a strong security team and they try to pay a lot of attention to security. So it's a huge target, but it's a difficult target."" Modern Cars at a Crossroads ""The attack surface of the car it's growing, and it's getting more and more interesting, because manufacturers are adding wireless connectivities, and applications that allow you to access the car remotely over the Internet,"" Feil says. Ken Tindell, chief technology officer of Canis Automotive Labs, seconds the point. ""What is really interesting is how so much reuse of mainstream computing in cars brings along all the security problems of mainstream computing into cars."" ""Cars have had this two worlds thing for at least 20 years,"" he explains. First, ""you've got mainstream computing (done not very well) in the infotainment system. We've had this in cars for a while, and it's been the source of a huge number of vulnerabilities — in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and so on. And then you've got the control electronics, and the two are very separate domains. Of course, you get problems when that infotainment then  starts to touch the CAN bus  that's talking to the brakes, headlights, and stuff like that."" It's a conundrum that should be familiar to OT practitioners: managing IT equipment alongside safety-critical machinery, in such a way that the two can work together without spreading the former's nuisances to the latter. And, of course, the disparate product life cycles between IT and OT tech — cars lasting far longer than, say, laptops — which only serves to make the gap even less wieldy. What Car Security Might Look Like For an image of where vehicle cybersecurity is going, one might start at infotainment — the biggest, most obvious attack surface in cars today. Here, there have been two schools of thought developing. ""One is: Let's just not bother, because you'll never keep up considering the product cycles in cars. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto — that is the way forward. So the car manufacturer provides a screen, and then your phone provides the infotainment stuff,"" Tindell explains. ""I think that's a good approach, because your phone clearly is your responsibility, Apple keeps it up to date, it's all patched, and then your car is just providing a screen."" ""The other school of thought is to let these big companies take control of the key functions of your cars. License an operating system from Google, and now it's the Google CarPlay equivalent, but directly wired into the car,"" he says. With a company like Google in charge, ""there is an update mechanism for it, just like it updates their Pixel phones. The question is, in 10 years time, are you still going to get updates for your car once Google gets bored and tries to shut it down?"" But even if manufacturers do manage to squeeze one part of the attack surface (unlikely) or outsource the responsibility of overseeing it to third parties (imperfectly), Pwn2Own 2024 has demonstrated that they'll still have vastly more problems yet to account for: EV chargers to modems, operating systems, and more. Where the Industry Has to Go To Tindell, what's really important is to keep the mainstream computing firewalled off from the control systems, so that there's a choke point. ""Unfortunately, some of the choke points so far haven't been very well-developed, and you can crack them on the end of a chain of exploits,"" he adds. ""I think they know what to do,"" Synacktiv's Feil says. ""It's the same process that applies to the rest of the IT industry: invest in cybersecurity, do some audits, hack your stuff until it gets very hard to hack."" Getting manufacturers to that point, he believes, might require some outside intervention. ""The industry has been able to push back to restrict regulation,"" Feil says. ""Their narrative is: We are having a tough time, because everyone is asking us to switch to electric cars, and it may affect our bottom line heavily. But they must show that they are doing something when it comes to cybersecurity."""

China’s BYD overtakes Tesla's electric car sales in last quarter of 2023 - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE5GaE1lS2JWbDRzZHpEcFByWEVWdktNTTAtalAycW1xczY3UGRsYl9haUlxNnJmSF9nSmVGNF9YRFhvY0RRNVZzc3QxaHFjZG5sVW8tWNIBWkFVX3lxTE5wY3FaS1AwWDFBWFhnQjN2eWRiMFVKZDVCWkZSZW41OVVvOHc3b1BaZVZUVFoxZldQZUc2UERzWXhnVDlFd0doNUZhUmlHQ2VreU9sRThyUTJEUQ?oc=5,"Tue, 02 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","China’s BYD overtakes Tesla's electric car sales in last quarter of 2023 Peter Hoskins & Natalie Sherman BBC News Reuters Models pose with a BYD car in Japan Chinese company BYD sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musk's Tesla in the last three months of 2023 as the two battled for top spot in the sector. BYD said on Monday it had sold a record 526,000 battery-only vehicles in the final quarter of 2023. It marked the first quarter its battery-only sales have outpaced Tesla's. The US-based firm has seen demand slow as borrowing costs climb. However, for the whole of 2023, Mr Musk's Tesla still sold more. On Tuesday, Tesla said it delivered a record 484,500 electric vehicles in the last three months of 2023 and 1.8 million for the year as a whole. The end-of-year performance was better than analysts had expected, as sales rose 20% from the same period in 2022 and picked up pace from earlier in 2023. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities described the quarter as a ""clear win"" for Tesla. But it fell short of earlier hopes. Last January, Mr Musk said that Tesla had the potential to achieve two million deliveries in 2023. The firm cut prices repeatedly to try to woo buyers. The milestone achieved by BYD is a reminder of the challenges facing the firm, which helped to launch the electric vehicle industry.  ""As BYD has accelerated into the fast lane, it's fresh evidence of just how competitive the EV market has become and how hard it will be for Tesla to swerve back to head the pack,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. Almost 1.6 million of its total sales were battery-only vehicles, the firm said. BYD's chief executive Wang Chuanfu co-founded BYD with his cousin in Shenzhen in 1995.  The company made a name for itself as a manufacturer of rechargeable batteries - used in smartphones, laptops and other electronics - that competed with pricier Japanese imports. It started selling its shares on the stock market in 2002 and diversified by purchasing a struggling state-owned car manufacturer, Qinchuan Automobile Company. Since 2008 BYD has counted veteran US investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder. Analysts say BYD owes its growth to its original business - batteries. They are among the most expensive parts of an EV and making them in-house saves BYD a lot of money.  Many of BYD's competitors rely on third-party manufacturers for batteries. BYD's battery business helped to give it flexibility to cut prices sharply at the end of 2023, lifting sales, which jumped by 70% in December alone."

"Tesla to Open State-of-the-Art Logistics Operations in Greenville County, SC - greenvillebusinessmag.com",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxPNjg5dXJ0bXN3cDBJSjFPcEZaeU0xVWNDQXJ4Tlg5QUhibjd0UTZFQzBpN0RpSm5IeGdwLUNQY1BRQXN2b2thQU1POTZkRVlEbDFVR0J1Ym9SYllRdzFmX1VGRE9WRzVkT1R5NlVmb1FORGU3b2xMZHpUN2ZBb2JoV2xfYWpNQVlrTWdXWWJaTklpUVJ1OTNNaTdwWVk2UXFFVnNlOXhzNmFLTDhTUEFfSFE3a1dxc2VJbHY4SWN2SHlRYi10RF9FSVhPRQ?oc=5,"Thu, 18 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","(Tesla is locating a logistics center at Fox Hill Business Park. Image provided.) Tesla  will open a regional distribution center in Fountain Inn in  Greenville County , S.C. in early 2024, another promising development in support of the booming automotive and EV economy of the Upstate and South Carolina. The center is believed to mark Tesla’s first major investment in operations in South Carolina. The inaugural Tesla facility in the Palmetto State will be located in  Fox Hill Business Park  -- the Class A business and industrial park which came online in 2020 as the first major business park developed in Greenville County in well over a decade. Fox Hill Business Park, located on 172 acres in the  City of Fountain Inn , is being developed by   The Sudler Companies , a family- and veteran-owned and operated development firm based in Chatham, New Jersey.  The Tesla facility in Greenville County will mark the second such venture between Tesla and The Sudler Companies in 2023, the duo having announced a similar project near Tampa, Florida, in 2023. “Tesla’s commitment to Fox Hill Business Park in Greenville County is a testament to the continued strength of our company’s partnership with Tesla and to the indisputable drivers that make the park and the Upstate a force in the logistics world,” said Brian Sudler, principal with The Sudler Companies. Tesla’s work in Greenville County will focus strictly on distribution of vehicle parts regionally and won’t include manufacturing, officials said. Tesla will absorb all of Fox Hill’s Building 3, comprised of 251,100 square feet. Depending on final development strategies, the Fox Hill Business Park campus can accommodate up to 2.5 million square feet of manufacturing, distribution, and warehousing activity across multiple buildings. Total investment and planned job additions by Tesla haven’t been made public. Late in 2023, Tesla posted a hiring notice for a training leader to support and train employees at the new facility in Greenville County. A company focused on accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to building a world powered by solar energy, running on batteries, and transported by electric vehicles that charge with clean energy. Tesla operates six vertically integrated factories across three continents and employs over 100,000 employees who design, build, sell and service Tesla products in-house. The Tesla announcement is the latest major announcement for Fox Hill, which also saw the recent addition of Sage Parts Plus, a global leader in replacement parts for aviation ground support equipment. Sage Parts opened new distribution operations in Fox Hill Business Park in mid-2023, leasing a 103,049-square-foot building to accommodate distribution operations along with its new global headquarters that houses its leadership team, purchasing, finance, customer service, HR, product management, and other support departments. Fox Hill Business Park has immediate access to Interstate 385, I-85, the Inland Port in Greer, South Carolina, and Greenville Spartanburg International Airport. The Sudler Companies are a vertically integrated development firm that includes construction and property management departments and owns and manages over 12 million square feet of commercial real estate across America. “The addition of the Tesla brand to Greenville’s business ecosystem is another example of the important role that speculative development plays in today’s competitive environment, and exactly why Greenville County was so supportive of The Sudler Companies and Fox Hill Business Park,” said Kevin Landmesser, interim CEO of the  Greenville Area Development Corporation . “We are excited that Tesla has chosen to call Fountain Inn home for their first facility in South Carolina,” said City of Fountain Inn Mayor GP McLeer. “This facility will not only create local jobs that will support families, but it also helps many of our region's existing suppliers get their products to one of the nation's most innovative automotive companies more efficiently. McLeer added, ""We continue to be proud of our community's expanding role in the automotive industry and are excited to see Tesla begin operations.” Since its founding in mid-2001, the GADC team’s efforts have resulted in the announcement of more than 34,600 new jobs and more than $6.6 billion in capital investment in Greenville County."

Tesla to spend $500M to bring its Dojo supercomputer project to Buffalo factory - TechCrunch,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOMU1LVkFiLTZmYjlXT05lLWVNa0huYXZyYlVMNG9nRW9Bd0N5TE1sUE05TGV4RUJSLXA0dmVDY1VHdk5lNkF6MDVZSzJaMXdOeFlzZElYaDBVYk5BdlVlOERYVDEtY2pXZThhRF9iTXZuRW40Q2tBcnd0czk4X0dYX2plNUgyVXBiUjlueWRNUVQ?oc=5,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla will spend $500 million to build one of its so-called “Dojo” supercomputers at its Buffalo, New York factory, the  state’s governor  Kathy Hochul said Friday during a news conference just days after CEO Elon Musk called the project a “long shot.”   Tesla’s decision was “informed by New York’s reliable power supply, strong talent pipeline and availability of usable space for the project,” according to Hochul’s office.   Dojo, which was first announced at Tesla’s “AI Day” event in 2021, is a supercomputer meant to help advance the company’s still-unrealized goal of building a self-driving car. Tesla plans to use the supercomputer to process reams of video data that come off of its electric vehicles in order to train the AI that now powers its most advanced driver assistance software, which it calls Full Self-Driving Beta. Musk said  last year  that Tesla plans to spend “well over $1 billion” on Dojo.   Bringing the Dojo project to Buffalo is the latest shift in Tesla’s priorities for the location, which has turned into  something of a boondoggle  for New York state. Once dubbed “Gigafactory 2,” Tesla took over the factory from SolarCity when it acquired the troubled solar panel company in 2016. The state had already committed $750 million to the plant by that point. Tesla promised to make Solar Roof tiles there, but struggled to produce the product at scale. Its partner, Panasonic, pulled out of the plant in 2020, and Tesla pivoted to employing people who  labeled training data  for its less-advanced Autopilot software.   Musk  said  last April that he believed the Dojo supercomputer project was a “long shot bet” that could “pay off in a very, very big way… in the multi-hundred-billion-dollar level.”   He reiterated the point this week on a call with analysts. “It’s not, like, a sure thing at all, It’s a high-risk, high-payoff program,” he said. “We are scaling it up, and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3, and whatnot. So, you know, I think it’s got potential, but the kind of size enough high risk, high payoff.”   While the $500 million investment received cheers during Hochul’s press conference, Musk downplayed the figure in a social media post on X, noting the company would spend far more money on Nvidia hardware in 2024.   “The governor is correct that this is a Dojo Supercomputer, but $500M, while obviously a large sum of money, is only equivalent to a 10k H100 system from Nvidia,” Musk wrote in the post on X. “Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year. The table stakes for being competitive in AI are at least several billion dollars per year at this point.”"

World’s Best-Selling Car Is the Tesla Model Y - Hagerty,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxORHBmVFIxeVZTX3M0OUtiZDVoelB3cjBfdkdoNlo3c292ek1qUG1NODM4alhWbTRTYnp6TEFLWVg0MnFVcDFvdHVLTEo5UXlrNTZDMldMUVY3dkVfTjZhWEF4OGZKa0FtVzRTRV9OT2J0V1VFeWVqZWFqYVRKcFF1RFNVRTJRaDg3bkp0RA?oc=5,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","For the first time in history the most popular new car across the planet is electric. Tesla sold more than 1.2 million  Model Y s in 2023 to put it ahead of Toyota’s RAV4 which had sales of 1.07 million and Corolla which found 1.01 million buyers.   Topping the charts in Europe and China enabled the Model Y to lead the field in total world sales, despite it sitting in only fifth place in the United States, behind the RAV4,  Dodge Ram ,  Chevrolet Silverado  and  Ford F-Series.   Overall, more than 456,000 Model Ys were sold in China, representing a 45% increase on 2022, more than 255,000 Model Ys found homes in Europe, and almost 386,000 hit the road in the U.S.A. As a result the Model Y counted for two-thirds of all Teslas sold globally.         Tesla       Much of the success can be attributed to an extremely aggressive pricing strategy which saw Tesla slashing the cost of a Model Y by as much as $10,000 to undercut rivals. “The price cuts over the course of the year, combined with Tesla’s reputation as a reliable and competitive EV manufacturer, helped to fuel already high demand,” explained JATO Dynamics analyst, Felipe Munoz who crunched the numbers. “As a result, Tesla is front of mind for many consumers looking to purchase an EV.”   Tesla had to increase production at its plant in Berlin—which only makes the Model Y—to 375,000 units, while in Shanghai, China almost one million Model Ys and Model 3s were built.   “Today the best-selling vehicle on the planet is an EV,” Tesla reported during its fourth-quarter earnings call. For those who still believe the world is not ready for the switch to electric cars these numbers paint a rather different picture.

Tesla warns of 'notably lower' sales growth in 2024 - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE1iM0RDaTlIczI0NDdfZEt4WW9IR282azdOZHVyU3BBZms3YWtJa0lwczN1YWFpbHZ4MEdDdnZxQWJZSHNCbklHYXlrRGF4SkM1VXdVY9IBWkFVX3lxTFBuelU3YXBXQUVLYkxBeGhDU1oyX0N6TXVLREJJNnNYTVIzdWdGY2JQWFhxbTZxZjFUT0w5eGphazV1T3dHODR6MmpfU1I2dnYtY0lNekNlOVNpQQ?oc=5,"Wed, 24 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla warns of 'notably lower' sales growth in 2024 Natalie Sherman Business reporter, New York Getty Images Tesla is forecasting a sharp sales slowdown this year, becoming the latest car company to warn of sagging demand. Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) maker said growth would be ""notably lower"" than in 2023, when deliveries rose 38%. The company's shares fell by almost 6% in extended trade in New York after the announcement. Mr Musk also warned that Chinese rivals ""will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world"" unless trade barriers are put in place. Tesla slashed prices repeatedly last year in a bid to keep demand up. The moves helped the firm sell a record 1.8 million cars in 2023, up nearly 40% from 2022.  But revenue grew at about half that pace, slowing precipitously at the end of the year. In its quarterly update to investors, Tesla said it was not expecting another big wave of expansion until it launches a new model.  The company has been discussing plans for a compact car that would be less expensive than its current Model Y, which starts around £45,000 in the UK.   ""Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform,"" it said. Mr Musk's call for trade barriers in the increasingly competitive market came after  China's BYD overtook Tesla  as the world's top-selling electric carmaker in the last three months of 2023. Wednesday's sales slowdown warning also came amid wider signs of weakness in the EV market, after several years of robust growth.  In the UK, sales of electric vehicles rose last year, but failed to make inroads against traditional cars as a portion of overall sales. In China, the biggest market for such cars, manufacturers have slashed prices as the economy slows, while in Europe, sales of battery electric cars shrank sharply last month, falling nearly 17% compared with December 2022, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. In the US, major car companies, including Ford and General Motors, have said they are scaling back production of electric vehicles. Around 1.1 million battery electric cars sold in the country last year, up nearly 50% over 2022 and more than double 2021,  according to the government .  Tesla said in the last three months of 2023, revenue was $25.1bn (£19.7bn), up just 3% compared with the same period in 2022. Its profits were lower than many analysts had expected."

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

But it wasn’t always that way. When I started at Tesla as employee number 350 in November, 2009, the company was seriously struggling financially. We were living hand to mouth, which is not unexpected from a small start-up. Still, despite our size, we were ambitious. We had just started the design phase of the Model S and we had high hopes for the car, but a low budget.   It may sound surprising today, but Tesla didn’t have billions in the bank back then, and developing a new car is a very expensive proposition. It takes hundreds of millions of dollars to design, develop, and tool up a new vehicle. Just to give perspective, when Ford developed the new Taurus in 1986, it spent $2 Billion. 25 years later, the costs had only gone up from there.     Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   So at Tesla, we had to get creative to save money wherever we could. You can see the effects of this in the chassis, especially in the steering system and rear suspension.   Here’s a video where I explain all of this:   VIDEO   Steering Racks Are Absurdly Expensive   Image:  TRW   One of the most expensive parts of a car’s suspension system is the steering gear. Designing and tooling a new steering gear can cost well over a $1,000,000. The housing is a complex casting, and the rack bar (an example of which is shown below) is a very complicated forging requiring some very fancy tooling to create the teeth and the helical groove for the electric power assist system.   Image via: Electric steering rack bar Ford Explorer с 2012-2015 LESS AUTOMATED PARKING SYSTEM ( motorherz.us )   Even in the old days of hydraulic steering systems, steering gears were expensive to make. There was no way a small start-up company like Tesla would be able to afford such a large bill. On top of that, Tesla was an unproven company. We did not have a long history of profitability and success yet. For many traditional suppliers, agreeing to design and develop something as complex and expensive as a steering gear would have been a major risk they were unwilling to take.   The way around that is to find a steering gear that already exists which the supplier and the current owner will agree to let you use. If you’re lucky, you could find a steering gear that fits perfectly, and where the supplier has enough additional production capacity to support your needs. Production capacity was unlikely to be a problem for most suppliers since, at the time, we were only expecting to sell about 20,000 Model S’s per year. But finding just the right gear was going to be a difficult task.   You can’t just go up to another car company and ask them for the details on all their steering gears to see which one might work for you. No one’s going to even answer the phone. You can leave a message but don’t expect to hear back from them.   The answer was to work through the suppliers. Fortunately, ZF-Lenksysteme, a well-known German steering supplier, agreed to work with us as long as we were able to find something in their current production catalog that would suit us.   The first step in this process was to determine what we actually needed. We did this by designing a front suspension while pretending that we could get whatever we wanted. We created a front suspension design we liked, and which would fit in our car. Out of that process came two very important numbers – the length of the steering rack, and something called the C-factor.   What We Were Looking For: Rack Length     The length of the rack is the distance between the left and right inner tie rod joints. This dimension is fixed by the length of the rack bar and by the design of the steering gear housing and would require a complete redesign of the steering gear in order to change.     The reason this dimension is so important is that the position of the inner tie rod joint relative to the upper and lower control arm inner bushings establishes how the wheel will steer as the suspension moves up and down (the inner tie rod swings up and down, and so does the control arm; the difference in the arcs at the end of those “swings” has huge handling implications; this phenomenon is called “roll steer.”). If the rack length is too long, i.e., the position of the inner tie rod ends is too far outboard, then the length of the tie rods will be too short relative to the control arms and in the suspension shown above, the wheels will steer inward (toe in) as they move up or down. The opposite will happen if the rack is too short and the inner tie rod ends are too far inboard.   Of course, the vertical and fore/aft position of the inner tie rod are also very important to the proper functioning of the suspension, but this can be easily changed by moving the entire steering gear up/down or fore/aft. There is no way to modify the inboard/outboard position of the inner tie rod joint once the length of the steering gear has been established.   C-Factor   The other dimension that is critical to the function of the steering rack is called the C-factor, and it refers to the distance the rack travels during one full revolution of the steering wheel. This number is usually in the 45-65 mm/rev range, and it determines how fast the steering feels. A higher number means the rack moves more for each turn of the wheel and so the steering will feel quicker than if the C-factor is a lower number.   The C-factor needed for a specific steering gear is determined by an analysis of the overall steering ratio, which is the ratio between the degrees of steering wheel rotation compared to the degrees of steering at the front wheels. For most passenger cars, this number is on the order of 14-17:1, meaning for every 14-17 degrees the steering wheel turns, the front wheels will steer 1 degree.   We Found A Land Rover Rack That Would Work, But It Was Right-Hand Drive. So We Flipped It   Once we had established what steering gear we wanted, it was then a matter of seeing what was in production that might be close. We provided our requirements to ZF-Lenksysteme, and they quickly determined that a rack they were soon to put into production for the Land Rover Evoque was very close. Here’s the Evoque right-hand-drive rack:   Image:  eurojag123/eBay   And here is a rack from a Model S:   Image:  1ofdabest/eBay   You can see how they are identical except for the ends of the tie rods (these are fairly cheap to tool), which had to be different to connect with our knuckle.   We would have to do some minor modifications to our suspension design to make it fit, but these would be easy to do and wouldn’t compromise the functionality of our design. The biggest problem was that the Land Rover gear was designed to be placed behind the centerline of the axle (called “rear steer,” not to be confused with rear axle steer) while we wanted to place ours ahead of the axle centerline (called “front steer”). The problem is that gears designed to be placed in front or behind the axle move in opposite directions. In a rack designed for front steer, the rack will move to the right when you turn the wheel to the right while in a rack designed for rear steer, the rack will move to the left when you turn the wheel to the right.   Clearly, we couldn’t simply take the Land Rover rack and place it into our suspension design. The car would steer to the left when you turned the wheel to the right!   Our solution was to use the right-hand drive rack from the Land Rover, flip it upside down (so the right side was now on the left and vice versa, and the bottom mounts that normally attach to the subframe are now pointing up), and place it in front of our axle for our left-hand drive application. Flipping the rack had the effect of reversing the direction the rack would travel, meaning it would now move in the correct direction when you turned the wheel and it also had the effect of moving the pinion, where the steering wheel and column attach, from the right side to the left side of the vehicle. This turned the Land Rover right-hand drive rear steer rack into a left-hand drive front steer rack that we could use.   That left only two things for us to do, or so we thought.   The first was to figure out how to attach the rack to our vehicle structure. Flipping the rack over meant that the bolts that mounted the rack would now end up on the top side of the housing and far away from our structure. The solution was to add two towers to the front subframe that reached up high enough to get to the bolts.     The second thing left to do was negotiate a commercial arrangement with Land Rover that would allow them to agree to let us use the steering gear they paid for, made with the tooling they purchased. Fortunately, we had some excellent negotiators on our team, and we came to a mutually beneficial agreement.   Another Problem: The Land Rover’s Steering Rack Was Too ‘Quick’   While the length of the Evoque rack was close enough that we could use it, the C-factor was quite a bit higher than we wanted. We knew we might have an issue, but we thought we could probably live with it. When we built our first prototypes however, we quickly discovered that the steering was much too quick.   The car was darty and difficult to drive on the highway. It wasn’t relaxing at all and would be uncomfortable for our customers. Since changing the C-factor of the rack meant designing and tooling a new rack bar and pinion, we had to find another way of making the steering feel slower.

"Professor Looks at Why Tesla May Settle in Texas, While X Found Its Spot in Nevada - University of Virginia School of Law",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNMmd1anhpc3VzMzF6WWV0RGJldEJ3SGd3ZFlGZkZoSHBkQUhFcy13LUM1eGg4RFp4aEw4SXA4WHZsV2RNaTNwa2Fmb2tvVWtsU3cyemlrTGxpQmlkX2JfY0g2WTFVVGVrMGt5WVZvdjI5clZiU1VOODBPLU0zUlpmY2tZcE5WeTN2eXRMWUY0MDJSb0I2TDdEZl9xVDZFYTd1UzVtLXBMOWdUYV9mNnZvQkgtSQ?oc=5,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Michal Barzuza     Immediately after a Delaware court in January said Elon Musk’s lucrative $56 billion Tesla compensation package was illegal, the X and SpaceX owner pivoted to marketing two other states as business-friendly havens for corporate charters. “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,” Elon Musk posted, then followed up: “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters.” He then polled X users, asking them whether the car company should move to Texas, where Tesla is physically headquartered — and suggested that the 87% “yes” vote had decided the matter. University of Virginia School of Law professor  Michal Barzuza , whose  scholarship has exposed  how Nevada deliberately structured its corporate law to protect executives like Musk, has a different explanation for Musk’s apparent preference for Texas over Nevada: The Delaware court decision on his compensation has doomed his initial plan to move the company to Nevada. Musk incorporated his X holding company in Nevada, then brought Twitter there after he took it private. He’s made it clear in the past that he would like to move Tesla there as well, Barzuza said. But because Tesla is a publicly traded company, Barzuza said, reincorporation in Nevada would still require shareholders’ approval and the court might not count Musk’s shares in that vote tally. “Since Nevada has significantly more protections on directors and officers, a move to Nevada may be considered self-dealing and thus may trigger the entire fairness standard, the same standard that [Delaware Court of Chancery judge Kathaleen] McCormick applied to Musk’s compensation package,” Barzuza said. In the Tesla compensation case, the court said Musk was a controlling shareholder, and in Delaware a conflicted controller transaction triggers the heightened scrutiny of the “entire fairness standard.” As part of that standard, a “majority of the minority” shareholders had to approve the compensation plan. They did, but the judge ruled they were not properly informed about their decision. “The standard also requires that independent directors conduct arms’ length negotiations with the controlling shareholder, and the court found that Tesla directors lacked independence, and ran a flawed process,” she said. Musk is seeing a similar scenario play out in real time as shareholders ask the Delaware courts to intervene in TripAdvisor Inc.’s attempt to reincorporate in Nevada, Barzuza added. TripAdvisor’s move was instigated by controlling shareholder Greg Maffei, and TripAdvisor shareholders are currently asking the Delaware court to refuse to count Maffei’s votes for the move, and to scrutinize the board approval of the transaction under the entire fairness standard. Musk is likely backing off moving to Nevada to avoid triggering such analysis. “Given Musk’s compensation result in Delaware, it would be too risky for him to attempt a reincorporation to Nevada,” Barzuza said. “A move home to Texas would be an easier sell to shareholders than a move to Nevada, and is less likely to trigger an entire fairness review, given that Texas is not as protective to management and directors as Nevada is.” There is also another advantage Musk sees in Texas: Tesla employs more than 20,000 people at an Austin factory, roughly the same size workforce as that of the neighboring University of Texas. With some projecting that the company could soon hit the 60,000-employee mark, Tesla would become one of the largest employers in the state. On Valentine’s Day, Musk announced he was reincorporating SpaceX, a privately held company, to Texas — a gift that Gov. Greg Abbott received with a warm greeting on X.  “When you provide income to so many employees, you have political clout,” Barzuza said. “So in the future, if he needs something, he may be seeing the home state as a place that he could influence more.” She cited a trend in the 1980s when firms that were incorporated and headquartered in other states lobbied their legislatures to get some protections from takeovers. One prominent New York corporate lawyer famously circulated a client memo urging companies to consider leaving Delaware for states that supported companies’ ability to fight off takeovers. “The companies were able to use their political clout within the state where their headquarters were to lobby for these rules,” Barzuza said. This all begs the question of why half of all public companies — and two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies — have incorporated in Delaware in the first place. The state offers favorable tax laws and a flexible incorporation law, and 230 years of specialized corporate precedent to draw from in sorting out disputes,  according to experts . So would a Tesla move to Texas be bad for shareholders? “I’m not that concerned about a mass migration of firms from Delaware, but I am concerned about the pressure that would create on Delaware courts,” Barzuza said. “So now when the court does its job, there’s a risk of firms leaving for the states where they are headquartered, or to Nevada.” Although Musk is frustrated with corporate law in Delaware, Barzuza sees its protections as a boon to the shareholders and  market integrity . In an earlier paper, she and David Smith from UVA’s McIntire School of Commerce found that Nevada attracts firms that are 30% to 40% more likely to report erroneous financial results that later require corrections than firms incorporated in other states, including Delaware. Such accounting errors can be red flags indicating fraud or incompetence, and overstatements can inflate share prices that may later crash. “Delaware offers a balanced law with some protections and some accountability, but Musk wants more protection from shareholder litigation,” Barzuza said. “It seems like he would have preferred Nevada over Texas — we can see that from the way he established the X holding company there and then merged Twitter into X — but given how he came out of his compensation case, he doesn’t want to go through what TripAdvisor is going through now.”"
Musk’s Tesla enters the mainstream as it embraces Biden’s EV charger money - E&E News by POLITICO,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxObzVXUFlod3R2cENLLS1IUWEyTVA2ZjEtdjh0WWotbENwUzBhOE45cFZOU1VHUDFGV0ZUWFBYa2FiRXlNdVlESV9sckhwVkxkQ2lKWXoxcnVYa3NIdmUwMHVNR3g3bW40Y3doNkxWVnEtZ3RUQUxTWFBJNjFjcVYxNE1Fb3dBU0tHWVA5MEJTc3ZwLVdiYjdF?oc=5,"Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Elon Musk is a constant critic of President Joe Biden — but his car company is the biggest winner from Biden’s effort to expand the nation’s supply of electric vehicle chargers.   Tesla is installing more charging plazas than any other company funded by Biden’s 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, according to an exclusive analysis of public records for POLITICO’s E&E News by the data consulting firm EVAdoption. Tesla has won almost 13 percent of all EV charging awards from the law, earning it a total of more than $17 million in infrastructure grants.   This comes on the heels of other wins for Tesla, which makes more electric vehicles and operates more charging stations than anyone in the United States, and is  cementing its charging technology as the nation’s de facto standard . And it comes despite repeated friction between Musk and Biden: The Tesla CEO has mocked the president as  “a damp sock puppet in human form”  who  “is treating the American public like fools,”  while the  White House has condemned Musk  for actions such as  endorsing an antisemitic post  on his social media network X.   The government funding will effectively embed Tesla’s distinctively shaped red-and-white chargers into the experience of not just Tesla drivers, but of all EV users on America’s highways. It is a win for Tesla, but also a form of capitulation: By agreeing to build federally funded stations, the iconoclastic company is also agreeing to play by the same rules as everyone else.   Trump calls Biden’s EV push a ‘ridiculous crusade’   lead image   People who study federal electric vehicle policy say they see few downsides to having Tesla, with the country’s largest and most reliable network of charging stations, take a leading role in creating a government-supported network. “It should lead to a generally larger and more robust network of stations,” said Aaron Kressig, manager of the transportation electrification program at Western Resource Advocates, an environmental policy nonprofit based in Boulder, Colorado.   And Musk’s behavior,  erratic as it is , doesn’t dent the EV community’s opinion. “Tesla is a company full of very smart engineers and other professionals who have accelerated the transition to electric vehicles,” said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, an EV analysis shop based in Washington. “While their CEO gets disproportionate attention because of his antics, he does not define the company, and the company does not need his input to succeed.”   Meanwhile, Tesla’s nearly-13-percent share of the monetary awards appears far too low to raise antitrust concerns.   The federal funds are being channeled to state departments of transportation, which  after long delays  are now making specific awards. It is within these pots of money that Tesla is winning the race. The federal EV-charging program supported by the infrastructure law is known as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, or NEVI.   Tesla is taking a different tack than other firms seeking the federal infrastructure money. First, it is proposing stations that are bigger than what other companies are building.   Meanwhile, it is building those stations at sharply lower costs. According to EVAdoption’s data, Tesla has won $17 million to build a total of 41 charging stations. The next-biggest winner of grants, Oklahoma-based Francis Energy, was awarded much more money — almost $30.4 million — to build just 37 stations.   At the same time, Tesla is putting fewer of its resources on the line in its efforts to win federal dollars. Many states have tried to entice charging companies to pay for a higher percentage of the cost of building each station than the federal government requires. More than other firms, Tesla has refused to do so, meaning states have to pick up more of the tab.   Biden announces funding for half a million electric vehicle charging stations   lead image   Biden promised in his 2020 campaign to catalyze the building of half-a-million charging stations by 2030. The bipartisan infrastructure law set aside $7.5 billion over five years to build a charging network.   The first priority under the infrastructure law is to build a network of charging stations at 50-mile intervals along major highways. That is where Tesla’s stations will be built.   The company won bids in seven of the 15 states that have announced which private companies are receiving funds. Tesla scored federal dollars in Alaska, Colorado, Maine, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas and Tennessee, but none in Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Vermont or Utah, according to the EVAdoption data. Other states, including California, haven’t announced their winners yet.   Tesla, which has no public relations department, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.     Musk has been silent on the role of federal aid in building his company’s Supercharger stations. On an earnings call in 2021, he said the company’s goal “is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors.”   How Tesla chargers went mainstream   Tesla’s federal funding surge caps a rapid role reversal for the company in the young world of EV charging.   A year ago, Tesla’s charging network stood entirely apart from competitors.   Its Supercharger stations were an exclusive perk for Tesla drivers, and were for the most part incompatible with other makes of EVs. The company’s network is vast, accounting for more than half of all public fast chargers in the U.S.,  according to a Department of Energy database .   The Biden administration, too, kept its distance from Tesla, with the president and his surrogates  rarely mentioning the company  in his first two years in office — a slight related to contrasting views of labor unions. Biden is a famously pro-labor president, and Musk opposes efforts by labor unions to organize workers at Tesla factories.   Then, last February, Tesla agreed to  open several thousand of its chargers to non-Tesla drivers  — a deal with the White House that opened the door to the company getting federal funds. That same month, Tesla opened its first station designed to charge a non-Tesla vehicle. In the spring came an even more significant development: Ford Motor said it  would build Tesla’s charging technology into its vehicles by 2025 .   Automaker after automaker followed suit. This month, one of the last holdouts, Stellantis, said it would also adopt the Tesla plug. The company is the maker of the Jeep, Dodge and Ram brands.   Companies rushed to the Tesla standard because charging stations using the main competing standard, the Combined Charging System, or CCS, have  proven to be buggy . That lack of reliability has started to undermine EV sales.   The widespread adoption of Tesla’s standards could have two material impacts for EV drivers: It would make it easier for drivers of future EVs from all brands to use Tesla’s existing Supercharger stations. And Tesla’s plug would start to appear everywhere. As automakers have adopted the Tesla standard, other, non-Tesla charging networks have followed suit.   The industry shift toward Tesla technology left government agencies in a difficult position.   Federal EV-charging investments are overseen by the Federal Highway Administration, an office of the U.S. Department of Transportation. In 2022, the FHWA had designed regulations under the law so that only CCS chargers could receive federal money.   In December, the highway office bowed to a new reality. It said a charging station using Tesla’s technology could get federal funds — as long as it also included a CCS plug. The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, a new agency stood up by the bipartisan infrastructure law,  applauded the technical adoption of Tesla’s standard , and FHWA started the process of  updating federal regulations  to include it.   Tesla’s system goes by several names. The industry has adopted Tesla’s name for it: the North American Charging Standard. Meanwhile, SAE International, a body that sets technical standards for a wide variety of products, has given it a different designation: J3400.   As the FHWA started embracing the Tesla system, the White House began delivering a similar message.  At a briefing  in December, Heather Boushey, a member of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, said Tesla’s standard is “providing flexibility” for the federal program and “is rapidly increasing in popularity.”   Meanwhile, the White House has gone from ignoring Tesla entirely to occasionally mentioning it, though Biden continues to object to Musk’s animus toward labor unions.   In late January 2023, Musk met with Mitch Landrieu, then the administration’s infrastructure czar, and John Podesta, the president’s chief clean energy adviser. Afterward, a reporter asked White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre if this suggested a rapprochement between the administration and the company.   “The outreach and the meeting says a lot of how important the president thinks the bipartisan infrastructure legislation is and how the Inflation Reduction Act is,” Jean-Pierre said, referring both to the infrastructure law and Biden’s climate law. “Senior members of his team had a meeting with Elon Musk today to do just that.”   What Tesla loses   Even as it gets millions in federal EV-charging support, Tesla is giving something up. The dollars are attached to specific requirements, such as submitting data about charging sessions to the Department of Energy. And like it or not, Tesla will have to follow the rules.   “To a large extent, this is a new endeavor for them, going for public funding,” said Nigro, of Atlas Public Policy.   It’s not that Tesla is a stranger to federal aid. In 2010, it got a crucial $452 million loan that helped it buy and build its first factory. Last year, the company got research and development and federal renewable energy tax credits to the tune of more than $1.6 billion.   People who buy the company’s car"
Patented Purdue design inspired by Tesla valve could improve performance of rotating detonation engines - Purdue University,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxNX3A1eWhyajRWX3hxazdxMWZKQnEyRlhXU2lDWVZvWnAxM2ptNjZmcmNyQ2ZuZElTNS1jMExYYWVpTXR2ckpsME16OTVxRWpvQmdyUWlTSElkZ25hZDlVWmg2d0N3aHJQV3h4S0lTYldtME9ZMjcyS0VNVkczNXFIR0VKckRfeTJtWWs5UlVhbnl5bmdGb2FMbVhQNk1qQUVNdDFJWDdaMkNIbDA0dEtxTUVZQ0NPd3ptR2JuTmduNTZkenhZZE02TzBGMjlmQTN5dHJkR1E5ZjZTaDQ?oc=5,"Tue, 27 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Researchers are testing an injection manifold design that prevents the reversal of fuel and oxidizer flows                           Li Qiao, a professor in Purdue University’s College of Engineering, is testing a Tesla valve-inspired design to improve the performance of rotating detonation engines. (Purdue University photo)       WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —   Researchers in Purdue University’s  College of Engineering  are testing a patented Tesla valve-inspired injection manifold design that could improve the performance of rotating detonation engines. RDEs are being developed as next-generation solutions in the field of jet and rocket propulsion.      Li Qiao , a professor in the  School of Aeronautics and Astronautics , is conducting numerical demonstrations on the design.    RDE benefits and drawbacks   Qiao said RDEs convert chemical energy into thrust, with a flame traveling through the engine at supersonic speed, which can be 10 times faster than in a traditional engine.   “RDEs are much more efficient than traditional engines by consuming less fuel and achieving high power of thrust in much less time,” Qiao said. “An RDE has no moving parts — turbines or compressors — which makes it less complex and less expensive to manufacture.”   Qiao said RDEs face stability drawbacks, however. The pressure behind a detonation wave in the engine is enormous, but there is high pressure on the wave to move backward. That pressure could reverse the flow of the fuel and oxidizer injectors.    “If the injection flow goes backward, the engine can lose power and power generation is lost,” Qiao said. “The pressure may cause oscillation, too, which causes damage to the fuel injection system.”   Tesla valves and RDE applications   Qiao said Purdue’s Tesla valve-designed injection manifold sustains a stable shock wave in RDEs, maintaining detonation and thrust while preventing the reverse flow.    “Tesla valves allow fluids to flow in one direction but make it virtually impossible for them to travel in another,” Qiao said. “Tesla valves are already frequently used in other fluid devices, but ours is the first proposal to use them as injection manifolds in RDEs.”   During numerical demonstrations on the injection manifold design, Qiao discovered in traditional designs that a significant amount of flow made its way back to the inlet where the fuel was injected.    “In tests of the Tesla valve-inspired injection manifold design, very little flow returned to the inlet,” Qiao said. “The majority of flow was self-impinged at the corresponding Tesla valves.”    Qiao and her team are looking to further perfect the design, which can be integrated into existing engine systems.   “We would be happy to work with industry and the federal government to apply this valve concept for specific engines in commercial and defense applications,” Qiao said.

Super Bowl Ad Slams Tesla’s Full-Self Driving Mode Used Around School Buses - School Transportation News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOYlBzT0xjQ202Q2JVX3MwVVJTU1JZYmRpcVpWa0FCRl9MQ1NSSS1zYy1pNFNvN2gyd3NlQ0ZLME1Xd3JXWHRNZ1JtZVNzcnN3T3RjWnFHX3dOanhHNHg5dDd4b3FPX2FqZTlBcHBDcE5PeVk1Q29JaWNjUmhMeWNLMU92V2I3VlZ4MUU1N3ViUjVDaU1Tbzh6NFdVdm41M1h6aXBjS1lMRVg4MWJkeUI3YUZiRQ?oc=5,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Lost amid Sunday’s overtime thriller, a controversial  Super Bowl ad  criticized Tesla’s Full-Self Driving (FSD) Beta Mode for being unsafe and unreliable, including around school bus stops.     The ad was created by the  Dawn Project , which has the goal of “making computers safe for humanity,” according to its website. The organization also ran a Super Bowl ad  last year .   This year’s ad, which aired regionally to select audiences in California, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Washington, D.C., cites the case of a 17-year-old North Carolina boy, who was  struck by a Tesla after exiting his school bus  last March. The Tesla driver had activated FSD, which is supposed to detect and avoid obstacles and other vehicles.   Dan O’Dowd, founder of the Dawn Project and CEO of Green Hills Software, told  School Transportation News  this week that he and his teams have run tests of Teslas operating near school buses and that FSD is unable to decipher the big yellow vehicle with flashing lights from a similar-sized truck with its hazards on. Additionally, O’Dowd said tests show that a Tesla using FSD often failed to stop for and hit mannequins placed in the roadway to simulate the presence of children.   O’Dowd is a software engineer who created secure operating systems for the Boeing 787 and B1-B Intercontinental Nuclear Bomber, Lockheed-Martin F-35 fighter jets and NASA’s Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. O’Dowd claims he has developed the only unhackable software in the world, which earned him the Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award in June 2021, and said that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta mode is fundamentally flawed and unsafe.   “You can see it on the [Tesla] display,” explained O’Dowd. “What do you do when you see a truck with its hazard lights on? Well, you stop, you peak around to see if there’s anybody in the other lane, and you go around it, right? That’s what it does. It does slow down sometimes but it’s going to go past the school bus because it thinks it’s a disabled vehicle and not a school bus. It doesn’t recognize a school bus. They need to teach it what a school bus is … They just haven’t done it.”   Still image from a video showing a test by the Dawn Project of a Telsa in Full Self-Driving mode but passing a stopped school bus.   He accused Tesla of being either incompetent or simply not caring.   “They can’t figure out how to recognize a school bus? Then, they shouldn’t’ have their software on the road at all,” O’Dowd continued. “Instead, they are putting their efforts into parking … You’re not fixing a critical vulnerability while you put resources into basically marketing gimmicks, that’s just ridiculous.”   O’Dowd, who unsuccessfully ran for a U.S. Senate seat to represent California on the sole platform of fighting Tesla FSD and Elon Musk, added that Dawn Project tests of similar technology in Ford and GM vehicles show they perform correctly.   An email sent to Tesla seeking comment was not answered at this report.   But Tesla sent O’Dowd a  cease-and-desist letter  last summer following another Dawn Project ad. Dinna Eskin, deputy general counsel for Tesla, argues that the Dawn Project manipulates the video and performed some of the tests that FSD is disengaged. O’Dowd published his own retort  online , and a spokesman for the Dawn Project said Tesla has not threatened any further legal action since then.   Additionally, a Youtuber  posted a video  last year debating the validity of the Dawn Project’s tests. User Dr. Know-it-all notes in his own video-recorded tests that Tesla FSD will not function properly when the driver overrides the system with their foot on the accelerator. Behind-the-wheel footage he posted shows a Tesla slowing down for and going around actual people as well as cardboard cutouts representing children. But the vehicle never stops completely. He also does not test the car at a school bus stop.

Tesla recalled over 2 million vehicles in the U.S. in December to install new safeguards in FSD mode, and Transport Canada said another 193,000 vehicles will be recalled there.   Then, on Monday,  Consumer Reports published an article  based on its own car safety experts’ findings that Tesla’s fix does not go far enough to fix the real problem. It reported that Tesla’s autopilot feature still does not have effective driver monitoring and does not allow for a seamless collaboration between lane-centering assistance and the driver’s own steering inputs.   NHTSA told STN that it “generally does not comment on open investigations.”   But NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigations records show a  Preliminary Evaluation  of Tesla’s SAE Level 2 driving automation system opened in August 2021 after identifying 14 crashes of Tesla Model 3, Model S, Model X and Model Y electric cars into stationary emergency vehicles. These crashes resulted in 15 injuries and one fatality.   “The investigation opening was motivated by an accumulation of crashes in which Tesla vehicles, operating with Autopilot engaged, struck stationary in-road or roadside first responder vehicles tending to pre-existing collision scenes,” NHTSA ODI investigators wrote in a June 2022 announcement that it was expanding its investigation. “Upon opening the investigation, NHTSA indicated that the [preliminary evaluation] would also evaluate additional similar circumstance crashes of Tesla vehicles operating with Autopilot engaged, as well as assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation.”   Regarding ongoing  NHTSA reviews of illegal school bus passing laws and technologies  to help mitigate violations, as required by the Investing in Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the agency said updates may be available “in a few months.”   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board in 2020 issued  nine recommendations  and reiterated several others following a fatal Tesla Model X crash two years earlier. Investigators determined system limitations of what it termed Tesla’s “Autopilot,” the driver’s overreliance on the system, and the driver’s distraction.   “This tragic crash clearly demonstrates the limitations of advanced driver assistance systems available to consumers today,” then NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said at the time. “There is not a vehicle currently available to U.S. consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to U.S. consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated.   “If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you’re not selling a self-driving car,” Sumwalt continued. “If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don’t own a self-driving car.”   Also this week, NTSB sent its own  cease-and-desis t letter to the Dawn Project because of unauthorized use of the agency’s log in the Super Bowl ad."
Tesla achieves record breaking sales of $1.79 billion from carbon credits - Reccessary,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPbWJ1YzVVLW9pcHh1eHRBbTI3MFNOUldGcXVpQmRXel9pbnAwWFh2TTgxTVR5LVZ1ZG1pZU5sQ2c4VTFKTFBZNXB5Rk0xLVJ3T1FBR09aSW1RcmgzVGFnS1BnblhtaDM0MmdPSVoxU0pXNGRxZERfdGFrSjhxcExFcHE4czNscnpTVWR3cUlwdXNUb2RnUm9qSXFOeXZ3N0h1T25DVm9HMm1tYU9oZEZMblZfNDItbUk?oc=5,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","(Photo: Unsplash)   Tesla earned $1.79 billion from carbon credit sales last year, as disclosed in its Q4 2023 and annual financial report, bringing its total earnings from such credits since 2009 to nearly $9 billion.   The revenue stems from trading regulatory credits to other automakers who are unable to meet emission regulations in the US, Europe, and China.   Tesla remains profitable by fulfilling its rivals’ needs to meet emissions standards. It is a business that was initially expected to decline. Since the EV giant incurs minimal additional costs to earn these credits, the sales represent nearly pure profit.   According to the recent   Q4 and annual 2023 filings , Tesla reported a $433 million income from the sale of carbon credits. The figure represents a 7% decrease year over year compared to $467 million in Q4 2022.  But the total annual revenue from selling carbon credits in 2023 increased to $1.79 billion from $1.78 billion. That enabled the EV maker to hit another record high in 2023.    The sustained revenue may have caught the company by surprise, given previous expectations that credit income would decrease as competitors ramped up EV production.    In 2020, Tesla’s former CFO Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned about relying too heavily on this revenue stream. He forecasted a decline in its significance over time.   Contrary to expectations, Tesla’s earnings from regulatory carbon credits have not seen a significant decrease, as last year’s earnings slightly exceeded the previous year’s income.   The revenue generated from the sale of carbon credits has become a substantial source of income for Tesla. In fact, the credits account for 11% of its overall gross margin for the quarter.   The growing sales of carbon credit underscore the value of the EV maker’s clean energy initiatives. This is also evidenced by the growth in another business of the company, energy generation and storage. In Q4 2023, revenues from the sector totaled more than $1.4 million, up from the year-ago earnings of $1.3 million.

However, the wording jeopardizes the future of a Lincoln Tesla shop.    In a court ruling last year, the Delaware Supreme Court noted the Motor Vehicle Franchising Practices Act defined manufacturers as businesses that contracted with third-party dealers to sell their vehicles.   In Nebraska, Sen. Carolyn Bosn proposed LB891 to redefine the word “manufacture” in Nebraska state law to include any business that directly sells the vehicles after manufacturing or assembly.    Bosn didn’t know that by defining Tesla as a manufacturer, her bill would also close a Tesla service center already operating in a “legal gray area,” according to the Lincoln Journal Star article.    “There had been no grand opening event, nor news alerts,” the article says. “And the redevelopment plan for the former Sears space wasn’t presented to the city’s Urban Design Committee until early January.”   The shop’s service manager told the Lincoln Journal Star that Tesla took possession of the building on Dec. 18.    Under the  Motor Vehicle Industry Regulation Act , manufacturers cannot operate service centers, the article said. This keeps manufacturers from competing with their third-party dealerships.    Bosn’s bill is facing criticism from the Tesla business and Tesla owners, the article said.    Tesla advocates told legislators in a Jan. 23 hearing that without the service center, Tesla owners would have to travel across the state for services such as warranty repairs, the article said.    A more  recent article from the Lincoln Journal Star  states, “Stakeholders on all sides have since worked together to draft an amendment to the bill that would allow Tesla and other startup car makers to service the cars they sell directly to consumers, clearing up the legal gray area under which Tesla opened its Lincoln service center.”    The article does not detail what the amendment says.    IMAGES   Photo courtesy of Baileystock/iStock   Share This:     Related   A new Nebraska bill would prohibit insurers from requiring aftermarket parts on vehicles aged 3 years or less at the time of the crash.

The bill, initially aimed at closing a loophole in the state's Motor Vehicle Industry Regulation Act, now threatens the existence of Tesla's recently established service center in Lincoln.   The controversy began when State Sen.  Carolyn Bosn  of Lincoln, prompted by the Nebraska New Car & Truck Dealers Association, introduced LB 891. The bill sought to amend the state law with less than 15 words, essentially updating the definition of what constitutes a car manufacturer.   ""The bill started off pretty simple,""  Loy Todd , the association's lobbyist, told the news outlet. ""Just updating the definition to make sure that if you manufacture motor vehicles, you're a manufacturer — as simplistic as that may sound.""   However, the straightforward legislative effort quickly became contentious. During a public hearing in January, Tesla representatives and owners expressed their concerns the proposed changes would inadvertently ban Tesla from operating its service centers in Nebraska.   ""Nebraska law currently allows Tesla to operate a service center for providing service, including warranty repairs in-state,""  Mary Vaggalis , Tesla's lobbyist, said during the hearing.   The news of Tesla's service center, opened in a former Sears auto shop at Gateway Mall, came as a surprise to many, including Bosn. The center, which began operations Dec. 18, exists in a somewhat legal gray area, unbeknownst to the public and even some legislators until just before the hearing.   The proposed legislative changes stem from a broader national discussion about the direct-to-consumer sales model employed by Tesla and other EV manufacturers. Traditional auto dealership laws, designed to protect dealers from direct competition with manufacturers, do not account for companies like Tesla that sell directly to consumers without franchised dealerships.   Despite the initial intent, Bosn and other stakeholders are now seeking a compromise. The aim is to allow EV manufacturers to provide essential services, such as warranty and repairs, without venturing into direct sales or manufacturing within the state."

Is Toyota The Next Tesla? - Real Investment Advice,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBvS3RwWXNEaGF3czFFRWtVUzlOaGN2X0JvNDY2T01fMU1VbmhCbkJFRXY1YkhabGNXcWZ3SkZ4dURfWTBGczIzOU9BcGR4eFlzbnJ2U3cxMWRWbnBja3B4QzNmekh5OHpuTEdDeTBQeEJoeVh4Mk9POU01TDZjQQ?oc=5,"Wed, 14 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Over the last four quarters, Tesla generated total revenue and earnings of $96 billion and $15 billion, respectively. Toyota’s revenue and earnings are roughly three times larger at $299 billion and $44 billion. Yet Tesla’s market cap is more than double that of Toyota.      Tesla shares have soared since going public, while Toyota and other major auto manufacturers’ shares have meandered along. Since going public in 2010 at $1.59 (split adjusted), Tesla shares are up nearly 12,000%. That figure is more stunning, considering it’s down 50% since late 2021. The graph below, charting the two stocks since 2018, highlights Tesla’s outperformance versus Toyota and the extreme volatility of its returns. As shown in the second graph, 40-50+% drawdowns are not uncommon for Tesla.       Tesla shares have outperformed Toyota’s and the market because of the significant growth of EVs, a robust outlook for EV market penetration, and forecasts that Tesla will maintain its lead role in manufacturing EVs. Tesla’s market cap relies on all three coming to fruition.   What if one or more of those do not occur? Might hybrids be the preferred technology until a more efficient battery evolves? Will EV competition from established and new auto manufacturers upend Tesla’s market share?  Maybe most critical, could Toyota, not Tesla, be at the forefront of a significant technological advance for automobiles?   With a price-to-earnings ratio of 9 for Toyota and 72 for Tesla, the answers to our questions have critical implications for shareholders of both stocks.      EVs VS ICE   Sales of EVs are multiplying. The latest data shows that EVs will account for 9% of all domestic new car sales in 2024. That leaves plenty of upside for EV manufacturers if the U.S. follows the path of other countries like Germany and China, in which EVs represent approximately a third of all new car sales.   While the transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric is sure to continue, its pace appears to be moderating. There are a few drawbacks affecting the uptake of EVs.    EV Drawbacks   Consider the following:     Fewer EV cars are eligible for Federal tax credits.   Kelley Blue Book claims the five-year cost to own EVs versus ICE vehicles is 15% higher.    The time to “fill up” an EV is much longer than an ICE car, and the EV recharging infrastructure is inadequate in many places. Consequently, “range anxiety,” or the fear of running out of power at the wrong time or location, is a concern.   Per the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)-  The final cost of the vehicle is its  depreciation  at resell, the difference between what the consumer paid for it and its worth after five years of ownership. EVs lose an average of $43,515 in value; ICE vehicles depreciate by $27,883.   EV batteries are less efficient in severe temperatures.   EVs have higher insurance and financing costs.   Lithium-ion batteries can catch fire in an accident and on rare occasions when they are not in use.     The obvious benefit for EV owners is fuel costs. NADA estimates an EV owner will save approximately $5,000 in gas and a few hundred dollars in maintenance costs over five years versus an ICE owner.   The market for EVs among early adapters and wealthier, environmentally concerned consumers is starting to get saturated. More car buyers will likely shift from ICE to EV, but that transition will be slower than it has been for the more eager first adapters.     Tesla Doesn’t Have a Monopoly Anymore   At one point, Tesla’s market cap was almost equal to that of the entire auto industry. Not only were Tesla investors projecting that Tesla would be the largest automaker, but also that some of their other ventures, like energy generation and robo-taxis would do fabulously well. A lot has changed since then.   Tesla no longer has a monopoly on EVs. Almost every auto manufacturer, and a few new ones like Rivian and Fisker, now manufactures EV cars, as shown in the graph below, courtesy of Cox Automotive.     Further, consider the following paragraph from Cox Automotive:     EV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1.     Bottom line: Tesla is losing its competitive advantage. They are relinquishing EV market share and cutting prices, ergo profits, to stay competitive.   Hybrid- The Bridge Technology   This discussion of hybrid automobiles does not refer to models with gas engines and battery packs that can be plugged into a power source.   As shown in the graph above, Toyota lags every other automaker, with only 0.5% of sales coming from EVs. However, Toyota has a different strategy regarding producing environmentally friendly vehicles. They are the largest seller of hybrid cars. The hybrid Prius was introduced to the U.S. market in 2000. Toyota’s first mover experience gives them a unique advantage in profitably manufacturing hybrid vehicles.   Hybrid automobiles can get 35 to 50+ miles per gallon. The technology enables a battery to capture a charge through its braking mechanism. This electricity then supplements its internal combustion engine.  Consumer Reports estimates hybrids provide a 40% improvement in gas mileage versus non-hybrids.   The graphic below, courtesy of CNBC, shows that U.S. sales of hybrids have easily kept up with EV sales since 2015.     Car owners prefer better gas mileage, and we presume many want to do their part to help the environment. That said, most auto consumers are not ready to fully commit to EVs. We listed some reasons for the hesitation, but likely the most important is the price. The CNBC graphic below shows hybrids and ICE vehicles are similar in price, while EVs are costlier.     We think hybrid vehicles can be the transitional technology of choice until a better EV battery evolves. Many consumers seem to agree!     More On Hybrids   The following is from a recent Wall Street Journal article entitled, Toyota Motor reports rise in quarterly net profit as sales grew.     Executives at Japanese automakers that are strong in hybrids, including Toyota and Honda, say they are skeptical of competitors’ ability to catch up quickly.  They observe that it took some two decades for Japanese carmakers to bring their hybrids to profit-margin parity with purely gasoline-powered vehicles.    Hybrid sales grew last year at a faster clip than sales for pure electric vehicles in the U.S. and some other markets.  Signs have emerged that the EV push might have gotten ahead of U.S. consumers who are worried about charging problems and higher prices.  That has steered them toward less expensive hybrids, which can be filled up with gasoline.    Automakers that had been rushing to pivot toward full EVs are now reconsidering.   General Motors said last week it would introduce some plug-in hybrid models in North America after facing pressure from dealers.   Ford Motor said last year it would seek to quadruple its hybrid sales in the next five years.     Solid-State Batteries   We now consider the next potential game changer for the auto industry: solid-state batteries. Solid-state batteries promise to eliminate many problems associated with current EV lithium-ion batteries.     Lithium-ion batteries are heavy, expensive to manufacture, slow to charge, and have a mileage range considered too short by many. Solid-state batteries vastly improve on those problems. However, whether the technology can be mass-produced at reasonable costs is unclear.   Many experts believe Toyota is the leader in solid-state battery development. Per Forbes:     Toyota’s stated goal is for their solid-state batteries to ultimately have a range of >1,200km, and to go from 10 – 80% charge in 10 minutes or less. This compares to the Tesla Model Y, which currently has a range of 542 km, and fast-charges in 27 minutes.     Other automakers are investing in solid-state battery development. Toyota believes they will be the first to produce cars with solid-state batteries. Production could come as early as 2027. The investment and production costs are enormous, and there are no promises these batteries will make economic sense for consumers or manufacturers.   Tesla does not believe in the viability of solid-state technology, and, as far as the market knows, it is not developing solid-state batteries.   Tesla 4680 Battery Cells   Elon Musk is an innovator. He knows that his current battery technology will fall behind his competitors if it is not improved. Tesla is betting on 4680 batteries instead of solid-state. The 4680 battery hopes to improve cost, weight, and energy density.   Per evlithium.com, the potential benefits are battery weight, which may be about 10% lighter. Additionally, the cost of the batteries could be 15% cheaper, and the driving distance on a charge could improve by 10-15%.   Such would be a decent improvement, but it pales compared to the promise of solid-state batteries.     Fundamentals and Valuations   So, with an appreciation for the role of hybrids, EVs, and solid-state batteries, let’s compare Toyota to Tesla and better appreciate their comparative valuations and fundamentals.   Valuations   Before looking at the valuation comparisons below, consider that Tesla is a high-growth company while Toyota is mature. Toyota is the world’s largest auto manufacturer, while Tesla is ranked 15 th . Given its smaller size, it is much easier for Tesla to gain global market share. The potential for outsized growth is reflected in the valuations. Tesla trades at valuations 6-8 times that of Toyota, implying 6-8x excess growth for Tesla over the long run.

"1.2 Million-Mile Tesla Model S on 14th Motor, 4th Battery Pack - Autobody News",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNVjBlRW1VVUtwbEpFcloyOWpUQ0VLY2JPRHh1dmYzZFd0YU5KbDdlTlFIcnVpenNrTU5qb0ZRRlBYVzJBMGJPY2hLVTQ2STducHZmMG85Rjg3YmZUTk1heGpSTjVUZjdXQVotaTZjay1fbGNUR2NmYTQyeTA5cWE1dmlQZWxIeWt0NVEwdVBSbmE0MzZtcHRZM1B6aw?oc=5,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","It's hard to believe there's a  Tesla  Model S out there with over 1.21 million miles on its odometer, but indeed there is. And here it is.   The car, a 2014 Model S P85, has racked up 1.2 million miles so far, which works out to approximately 131,000 miles per year.   VIDEO   Could you imagine driving that much? And doing so in an electric car, which naysayers often state can't go the distance. Well, we think this car proves EVs can be driven a significant amount of miles per year and the charging infrastructure, at least in some parts of the world, can support high-mileage drives.   Back in 2019,  Elon Musk  congratulated  Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg , the owner of this particular Model S, which at the time had 1 million kilometers -- 621,371 miles -- on its odometer. That seemed like a solid accomplishment but flash forward to today and the mileage has basically doubled.   The video embedded above is one of the first to feature Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg. Up until now, much of the info about Gemmingen-Hornberg's Model S was limited to tweets. As  Watt Energy , the uploader of the video explains:   ""His car has 1.9 million km / or 1.18 million miles on the odometer at the time of filming and Hansjorg aims for more. There is little precise information about him online, mostly based on some older tweets or on assumptions of how he manages to put so many miles on his car. I went to Germany to meet Hansjörg directly and to find out the complete story firsthand from him!""   There's a lot more to the story though. Gemmingen-Hornberg previously owned a Tesla Roadster. He managed to rack up 400,000 miles on it, despite the lacking infrastructure at the time. He decided to buy the Model S shortly after it came out because it was roomier and more comfortable. However, he didn't buy a new Model S, but a used 2014 model with 18,641 miles.   Some early Tesla Model S EVs were known to have issues with their rear motors. This particular Tesla suffered from this. The rear motor was replaced 13 times, so if we include the original it came with, that's 14 motors over the course of 1.2 million miles.   Most of the replacement motors were refurbished units and the problem there is Tesla didn't know the real issue so it didn't know how to properly fix the motors. Some of these replacement motors failed very quickly. Some were covered under warranty, while others were not.   In regards to the vehicle's battery pack, it fared better than the motor. However, this Model S is currently on its fourth battery pack. Four batteries at 1.2 million miles means the average pack lasted some 300,000 and counting.   Gemmingen-Hornberg noted he does take it easy on his Model S. He does not drive the car for long distances without giving it and himself a break. He said he only covers about 62 miles at a time before pausing for a while.   In regard to depleting and charging the battery, the Model S owner said he aims to recharge it when it drops down to 20%. He doesn't fully deplete the battery and also doesn't top it off.   The other aspects of the car, like the exterior and interior, have held up well. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into detail about other wear items like brakes, tires and so on.   Gemmingen-Hornberg is retired and likes to see the world by car. The Model S has been driven to Africa, Morocco, Sweden, Austria and China. It seems that's only the beginning though. He wants to continue driving the car and let go of his  Lucid  Air reservation so the Model S can rack up even more miles."

(Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg News)       [Stay on top of transportation news:  Get TTNews in your inbox .]   For the sake of this review, let’s suspend whatever we think of  Elon Musk .       	  			               A truck this unusual deserves attention unencumbered by the distractions of its creator. The  Cybertruck  itself needs no introduction:  Tesla Inc.  has been collecting deposits since 2019 and started delivering the trucks in November. The company hasn’t said how many are out there, but we know that  Serena Williams’ husband owns one , as does  Pharrell Williams .       	  			               Contrary to the standard practice for most automakers, Tesla has not lent out the truck for mainstream press reviews. So I rented one from James Van Crofton, a real estate agent who listed his on  Turo , the car rental platform. Twenty-four hours and $1,391 later, I can report that Tesla’s paean to Brutalism surprised and delighted me as I drove around Los Angeles. While I kept the slab-sided Cybertruck in admittedly coddled conditions — I didn’t take it to a construction site, nor did I use it to tow a boat — I found its nimble performance and thoughtful interior a fascinating juxtaposition to its crude design.       	       The Setup   James dropped off an all-wheel drive version of the pickup outside my house in Hollywood on a Friday morning. He had bought it in the first “Foundation” round of sales, in which he paid about $113,000 including taxes and fees, and got some bonus features like home charging and white accents in the interior. You can sign up to buy the current model in this line on the Tesla website now for $76,390 AWD.       	  			                 Tesla's Cybertruck is 70.5 inches tall, 223.7 inches long and rides on 20-inch wheels. (Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg News)       	  			               I expected it to look futuristic in real life, considering its sci-fi-obsessed creator. But it actually looked nostalgic, reminding me of the stainless-steel wedge-shaped DeLorean featured in the 1985 film “Back to the Future” and the apocalyptic Spinners in Ridley Scott’s 1982 movie “Blade Runner.” It looks like a cross between a Tonka toy and an adolescent video gamer’s ultimate fantasy machine — not necessarily amateur but a bit ridiculous.       	  			               I liked how the bands of lights at the front and rear matched the minimalistic design language of the body and, oddly, that the thing rolled on 20-inch wheels. So many expensive vehicles these days rock 22- and 23-inch variants, but the smaller wheels on the Cybertruck worked. Bigger wheels, if you choose them, could make it look even sillier than it already does; also, their extra size and weight will reduce driving range.       	  			               To open the door, you have to press an undetectable button hidden shoulder height on the B pillar (James had to show me where). Once inside, I encountered a serene environment. As in other Teslas, there are no knobs on the dashboard that spans the width of the cabin, punctuated only by an 18½-inch control screen and the oblong but elegant steering wheel. My first impression? Not bad. Sure, the cabin of anything from Mercedes-Benz, for instance, feels far more luxurious, and the Cybertruck lacks the nappa leather typically found in a vehicle at this price. But the interior’s clean, modern design goes a long way toward making it feel well done.       	  			                 Cybertruck offers seating for five, with a 9.4-inch rear touchscreen in the back. (Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg News)       	  			               The console between the front seats doubles as storage and armrest, but since things like the climate and audio controls, as well as the shifter, are embedded in the computer screen, and the ceiling is a massive glass top, the cabin feels capacious. The glove box glides out and offers enough space for a laptop; the two cup holders are the bare minimum I’d need in a truck. I wished I had a real button to push to engage the vehicle; using a screen without even the benefit of haptic feedback for shifting is neither the quickest nor the most intuitive way to get a vehicle to move. James pointed out that if I didn’t like screen-shifting, I could also use some selector icons located overhead near the rear-view mirror to shift, but he hadn’t figured out how to use them yet. I stabbed them a couple of times but got no result so kept my shifting to the main dashboard screen — stabbing my finger overhead seemed more awkward than the alternative.       	  			               James handed me the black credit card-like key that Teslas use, which I placed in the front of the center console. That started the vehicle. I put my foot on the brake and, on the dashboard screen, slid a cursor from N to D; then I gently pressed the accelerator pedal. Liftoff! Such a big beast sliding elegantly forward without a sound felt very cool.       	  			               The Day   My plan was to use the Cybertruck for a stereotypical L.A. day: morning coffee, photo shoot, lunch in West Hollywood and some afternoon chores topped off with a Friday night sauna-and-dinner double date.       	  			               I’d hardly left Hollywood when I learned the first rule of Cybertruck: If you’re feeling shy, don’t drive it. You’ll be forced to discuss it with myriad strangers. The thing incites fervor to the point of recklessness. I waited for coffee at my local Intelligentsia, and multiple grown men on Hollywood Boulevard ran into traffic to take its picture. I smiled and waved then quickly pulled away. Pre-caffeine, it was better for us all if I didn’t engage.       	  			               Then I drove downtown, gliding through traffic in a buffer of silence that felt downright elitist. I loved how light the steering felt and the unexpected smoothness of the regenerative braking. That steering wheel, shaped like an oval that has been squared off at the edges, felt ergonomic, like a natural extension of the rest of the truck. (It’s no accident that F1 cars also have rectangular steering wheels — the design works). The placement of the controls for indicators and things like the single wiper blade were far less obvious. I had to hunt for them. It was annoying.       	  			                 The truck bed is secured by a solid lockable automatic cover. (Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg News)       	  			               The Cybertruck is 70½ inches tall and 223.7 inches long, with more than 17 inches of total ground clearance. People gawked. It was fun to see them measuring their own ride height against the towering Cybertruck. At nearly 6 feet tall when fully extended at its highest, it’s not quite as big as a UPS van, but it is as tall as your average seven-passenger SUV. I scanned the horizon like Charlize Theron as Furiosa in “Mad Max: Fury Road.” Stop me if I start talking about shaving my head….       	  			               I parked downtown near the Walt Disney Concert Hall, a Frank Gehry-designed metal mountain that felt tailor-made to match the truck’s angular stance. A construction worker abruptly jerked his pickup to the curb — no indicator of course, this is L.A. — and jumped out as I took photographs. His enthusiasm was endearing, if not his driving.       	  			               The Pivot   Next, I needed some nosh. Chateau Marmont has the prettiest garden in L.A., even if it lacks the most enticing food, so I headed there.       	  			               I’ve driven other large vehicles powered by electricity, like the Hummer EV, Kia EV9, Rivian R1T and Rolls-Royce Spectre. I expected that the 6,603-pound, 600-horsepower truck would approximate their feel with powerful thrust, smooth acceleration and effective regenerative braking, and it did, towering over cars and surging forward like a spaceship with its gearless, instant-torque acceleration. It’s worth noting that the Cybertruck weighs far less than the 9,400-pound Hummer and about the same as the 6,855-pound electric Ford F-150 Lightning.       	  			                 Pulling into the Chateau Marmont off of Sunset Boulevard proved easier than anticipated. (Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg News)       	  			               The air-ride suspension with 12 inches of lift (available at the tap of a screen icon) had me feeling completely separated from the road. I don’t recommend whipping through traffic or late-braking. With an overall length of nearly 19 feet, tight corners and bends and curves in the road require careful attention. Don’t even get me started on parking this thing at home; I left it on the street overnight, since it didn’t fit in my driveway. I expect it would be too large for some home garages.       	  			               But it differentiated itself from the others with tactile, nimble steering, and, at low speeds, with its sublime maneuverability. Where some big trucks feel cumbersome picking their way through parking lots, the Cybertruck gave no such stress. The real test was arriving at the Chateau, where I flipped the key card to the valet and basically told him to figure it out (sorry, Ray!). Both man and truck handled the notoriously tight, awkward parking garage with aplomb. Credit Ray’s four decades of experience working at the Chateau — and the Cybertruck’s rear-wheel steering. Both driving and parking visibility remain mostly unhampered even by the abrupt roofline and side pillars. The camera that doubles as a rearview mirror takes some getting used to, but it is effective.       	  			                 The dashboard and interior are unencumbered by buttons and knobs. Climate, audio, navigation, driving and other functions are controlled using the Cybertruck’s 18.5-inch touchscreen. (Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg News)       	  			               After lunch, on a quick errand at Home Depot, swarms of iPhones clicked around me as I hunted for a parking spot. Is this what celebrities feel like? I’ll pass. Fifteen minutes later, I sp"

The patent gives multiple possible options for the multi-layer glass approach with the number of layers ranging from one to 20 and the glass thickness ranging from 0.5 mm to 5 mm depending on the layer.    The patent’s abstract describes the glass as “a multi-layer glass stack for a vehicle windshield with improved durability as described. The multi-layer glass stack includes an external-facing glass layer, an internal-facing glass layer, and an adhesive interlayer positioned between the external-facing and internal-facing glass layers. The external-facing glass layer may include borosilicate and/or does not include soda lime glass.”    The patent also states the glass will be used for a windshield.    While Tesla first presented “armor glass” on a Cybertruck, the patent doesn’t clarify if the glass would be used for a specific vehicle.    During the unveiling of Tesla’s Cybertruck in 2019, Elon Musk had staff throw a metal ball at the vehicle’s window to show the toughness of the glass. However, the demonstration didn’t go as planned and the glass spiderwebbed with cracks.      VIDEO   According to  CarBuzz the original “armor glass”  never made it to production.    In November, Musk tested the Cybertruck’s glass once again during the vehicle’s delivery event. This time staff used a baseball, instead of the metal ball. The glass passed the test.    VIDEO   After the Cybertruck event, Tesla started   selling stickers designed to look like a broken window  and shaped to fit the truck. The stickers quickly sold out, according to CNN Business.    The first Cybertrucks were delivered to customers during the event. As of December, the Cybertruck is available for sale in North America.    Soon after Cybertrucks hit the streets,  Reuters released an article  with safety professionals questioning if the vehicle’s shape was dangerous. The professionals told Reuters the truck could cause excessive damage or harm to others during a collision.    “The big problem there is if they really make the skin of the vehicle very stiff by using thick stainless steel, then when people hit their heads on it, it’s going to cause more damage to them,” Adrian Lund, former Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) president, told the outlet.   However, an IIHS spokesman previously  told Repairer Driven New s that such worries could be premature.   “IIHS hasn’t evaluated the Cybertruck,” Russ Radar said. “The discussions we’ve seen so far appear to be based on speculation.   “I would add that our experience with Tesla is that they aim for the highest safety ratings in IIHS tests. We have no reason to expect anything different with the Cybertruck.”   IMAGES   Photo courtesy of Roman Tiraspoisky/iStock   Share This:     Related   General Motors (GM) received a federal patent for a “smart glass” invention that can dim the glare of headlines from oncoming vehicles.

Tesla Adopts Interior Radar for Interior Monitoring - IDTechEx,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNb0RTZWh1NTZlTGlhTlAtanQ0RE1EbXR0cUlJQXRwVUUydXMxRDFkYXNfSkJTVjU4N29KdUMxUDRxZ05xNWNnUWFrVWw5ZzdHYkdGR3RmQ21qbUduc3lHb0tmYk9qRUFTeVRmcElLNFZySWxpMHNPWVhFTUFjZ0xXYmUtUFhqTmlKTEJQWHVwcEwxRm1KTzlQU0ZUTmwteU9uc2xnZQ?oc=5,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","With the shift towards electric vehicles, end-users are becoming less concerned about traditional differentiators like engine horsepower and are placing greater emphasis on smart interior functions. This trend is compelling automotive OEMs to invest more efforts in enhancing interior features, thereby adding greater value to their products and distinguishing them from other vehicles.   Driven by regulations such as Euro NCAP, driver monitoring systems (DMS) have gained significant traction and have transitioned from a luxury feature to a new norm. As of 2024, most DMS utilize 2D near-infrared (NIR) cameras. Due to their relatively low costs, they are anticipated to be increasingly adopted, emerging as the dominant enabling technology for DMS. For automotive OEMs to further set themselves apart from competitors, advanced features such as gesture control, child presence detection, and seat belt detection are also expected to gain momentum, especially in mid to high-end vehicles. Currently, the 3D time-of-flight camera stands out as the most widely used technology for DMS, while some automotive OEMs, such as  Volvo  and  Tesla , are incorporating  in-cabin radar  modules.   Radar has played an important role in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for over two decades. Utilizing radio waves with a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) coding system, radars can accurately measure the distance and relative velocity of objects within their field of view. However, historically, radar modules have predominantly been employed for exterior sensing rather than interior applications.   As of 2023, according to Tesla's website, the in-cabin radar operates within a frequency range of 60GHz to 64GHz, falling within the license-free ISM band. The detection distance of these radar modules typically ranges from 0.4 meters to 2 meters, effectively covering the interior space. Though unconfirmed officially by Tesla, recent news suggests that their cybertruck is equipped with in-cabin radar modules for occupant monitoring, including functions such as child presence detection and seat belt reminders.   Comparison of radar manufacturers and prices. It is worth noting that  NXP 's radar operates at a higher frequency band, and IDTechEx believes that this frequency band is likely used for exterior monitoring instead of interior monitoring. Source: IDTechEx - ""In-Cabin Sensing 2024-2034: Technologies, Opportunities and Markets""   Similar to radar modules, 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras also find application in occupant monitoring. 3D ToF cameras operate by utilizing near-infrared illuminators like LEDs or vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VSCELS), in conjunction with image sensors. However, privacy concerns surround the use of cameras, even though some suppliers assert that they can address this issue by either blurring people's faces or storing data solely onboard.   An additional limitation of 3D ToF cameras is that, unlike in-cabin radar modules, they are unable to detect people or objects through obstacles. Furthermore, due to their reliance on computer vision technology, cameras necessitate intricate algorithms and recalibration, introducing technical complexity to their implementation. Despite these drawbacks, some suppliers are actively working to address privacy concerns and improve the overall capabilities of 3D ToF cameras for occupant monitoring in automotive applications.   Benchmark of OMS Technologies. Source: IDTechEx -  ""In-Cabin Sensing 2024-2034: Technologies, Opportunities and Markets""   As of now, 3D ToF cameras are more well-adopted for OMS and have advanced features compared with radar modules. However, by comparing the costs and functions of radar modules and 3D ToF cameras, IDTechEx believes there are potential opportunities for radar modules. 3D ToF cameras are adopted in Li Auto L9,  BMW  iX, and the new ARCFOX αS series, whereas radar modules are expecting adoption in Tesla and Volvo.

Tesla Quietly Responds to Cold Weather Woes by Adjusting Range Calculation - PCMag,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOWFJwMHFjZ1E1U2VFOEdQRE03ZnlCV3JBc0RreTZWTnBCd2dxZWcyT3liZjJBM0dPNl9Bei1CblE4ZHFVeEJMaGRvYzZLeU9sd1pES2N6MU00WnhNdGY1UVNEN2pISGo4aHgwRUJGZklNLTdCWV9MMGxzT2E5T3o1RENtU1hnNFI5Y2l1Y2UtTXAxU2t5MFBLSE5wQmdrdkZqU0Y0?oc=5,"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla is rethinking its cold weather approach after this winter's cold snap put drivers out of commission,  angering even the biggest Tesla fans . In its latest software update, version 2024.2.6, Tesla adds a new dimension to its range calculation: Battery age. ""Your estimated battery range now incorporates additional characteristics related to battery aging over time,"" the release notes say,  Not A Tesla App reports . Though drivers may see a lower range number on the dash, it should be more accurate. This is especially helpful in cold weather, which  zaps range much faster  than warm temperatures. There are many factors that determine a vehicle's range, including the driver's charging habits and driving behavior, outside temperature, and wind resistance. But battery age is one of the biggest. Older vehicles can expect to lose about 20% of their total range after a decade. Newer battery chemistries are  in development  to solve the degradation problem, but they won't be ready for another 10 years or so. The Tesla dash screen will also now alert drivers if their battery is too cold to fast charge, and must be preconditioned first, a known method for reducing charging time in cold weather. When drivers plug in at a Supercharger station, the display will show how long it will take to warm the battery before it begins Supercharging.     Recommended by Our Editors       A blue snowflake icon will appear on the dash screen when ""some of the stored energy in the Battery is unavailable because the Battery is cold,"" according to Tesla's  guide for driving in cold weather . ""This portion of unavailable energy displays in blue on the Battery meter. Regenerative braking, acceleration, and charging rates may be limited. The snowflake icon no longer displays when the Battery is sufficiently warm."" The latest software update also introduces a warming function for the charge port. If the driver navigates to a Supercharger using the dash screen, the port will get toasty along the way, making sure it doesn't get frozen shut in extreme temperatures. Tesla's cold weather guide also notes drivers can use the ""defrost car"" function in the mobile app to loosen up the charge port.     Get Our Best Stories!

Lawyers in Musk pay case seek fee of $6 billion in Tesla stock - NBC News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPYm5jVzM1V3YybHIwS2h1ZS1KMlU2TlNkWHBLdExfUHVCelBOdFM0M0VnY3ZRSWNIREtweUJENzV2c0ZyRGlBZDZVLXBXR3ZoNXF4ZmtpUDR0cWk1czNfdFZZSEFvU3A5UEVvR1BlempMV01YOHVXSk1tZTFCY1d2Nl9hNGE0Tmk0WVpYN1VNZmp3OFF5eXNJV2tQX09MTWFDMkpxSGZR0gFWQVVfeXFMTlRLNThfaDlmUGpvMUthbHlVSXZwa1gtZjFraWlwZm44cUlBOUF3Y05ycXBBT0JnczV0MDctS0xPckdJd2VLOW1nR1dtbHdabDZHY01OLUE?oc=5,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Lawyers   asked a Delaware judge to award them  Tesla  stock worth nearly $6 billion as of Friday as their fee for successfully arguing that CEO Elon Musk’s 2018   pay package was unlawful. The fee would dwarf records for attorney paydays if a judge approves it. Lawyers who worked on Enron-related class actions were awarded  $688 million in fees  in 2008. The lawyers had earlier convinced the Delaware chancery court to  revoke Musk’s $56 billion  pay package from 2018, with the judge ruling that Tesla’s board of directors failed to prove it was fair to shareholders. On Friday, in a petition for fees and expense reimbursement filed to that court, the attorneys argued that the fee would be justified given how much value they delivered to Tesla shareholders. The lawyers represent former heavy metal drummer Richard Tornetta, who filed the suit on behalf of his fellow Tesla investors. The lawyers are asking for just over 11% of the Tesla shares that would have gone to Musk, or slightly more than 29.4 million shares. Tesla’s stock closed Friday at $202.64 per share, meaning the fee would be worth about $5.96 billion. Taking their pay in Tesla shares demonstrates they are prepared to “eat our cooking,” the lawyers wrote. They added: “This structure has the benefit of linking the award directly to the benefit created and avoids taking even one cent from the Tesla balance sheet to pay fees. It is also tax-deductible by Tesla.” The shares they’re asking for would be freely tradeable, they noted, while Musk’s stock options included a five-year holding period starting from when he exercised them. Still, the lawyers described the nearly $6 billion in shares as “conservative” under Delaware law, which they said entitles them to 33% of the “quantifiable conferred benefit.” “Nevertheless, in an effort to be conservative, Plaintiff’s Counsel does not seek the 33%” warranted by previous cases, they wrote. They noted that they took the case on a contingency basis and would have gotten nothing if they had lost. “Plaintiff’s Counsel have not been paid for their work, nor have any of their costs or expenses been reimbursed, and litigating this Action required the allocation of a substantial amount of Plaintiff’s Counsel’s time and resources over six years, including considerable out-of-pocket expenses,” they wrote. Greg Varallo, lead counsel for the plaintiffs and the lawyer who signed the brief, did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. He’s the head of the Delaware practice for the law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann.  Representatives for Musk and Tesla also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The lawyers wrote that throughout the history of the case, they collectively logged 19,499.95 hours — meaning that a nearly $6 billion award would equal a per-hour rate of $305,550. They argued, though, that the hours worked was of secondary importance, if it was worth considering at all. “Delaware seeks to incentivize, not punish, efficient litigation,” they wrote. The lawyers, based in Delaware and New York, are also asking for an expense reimbursement of $1.1 million. Musk’s pay package was the largest ever disclosed in corporate America, according to Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick’s  200-page ruling . She said that the process leading to the package was “deeply flawed” in part because Musk drove the process for determining it, and it was agreed upon by Tesla board members “who were beholden to Musk.” Musk is  expected to appeal  the ruling. The CEO and centibillionaire has also said he will seek to  move Tesla’s site of incorporation to Texas ."

I realize that this is meant to be a gardening column however for the last ten days my brain has been filled with Tesla minutiae rather than with garden details. Fortunately, after a lot of frustration, there is a happy ending. As most people have heard, dealing with Tesla means dealing with the Tesla App. Tesla, unlike any other car company in the world, is allergic to human contact. This also involves buying a Tesla and trading one in – and in my case, this proved to be an unnerving process. In the middle of 2022, in the midst of the pandemic, I managed to buy a Tesla 3, waiting three months for it to materialize. I thought that, quite possibly, this would be my almost-final car. Buying it was a headache, which I have already described earlier in a previous  column . Now, let me say this: I love driving an electric car, and I savored my Tesla, nicknamed “The Josy” after my first dog. There were some roadblocks to be sure. When my power cable began refusing to power The Josy, I lost my cool. My problem lay in the fact that I had omitted to introduce the power cable to the Internet: Who knew that an electric power cable needed to communicate via the Internet? After two weeks of talking to help on the telephone, necessitating many calls as the Internet insisted on dropping my call throughout the many steps of attaching the cable to the Internet, I finally succeeded. From then on, I happily powered The Josy to my heart’s content. However, one insurmountable problem remained: The Josy was simply too low to the ground. Getting in and (especially) out of it took some effort, a fact that doesn’t dismay much of the car-buying public that is (in my eyes) dangerously young. Proudly, I’m a member of the Silent Generation – with this one constant: It would never get easier getting out of The Josy. Consequently, with the surging stock market, the strong economy, and the reduction in the price of Teslas, I determined that the solution to my problem was to purchase a Tesla Y, which is the height of a normal car. This time, I knew to head straight for the Tesla App. I determined that I wanted a Y that had an extended range, as this gave me four-wheel drive. Because I’m acutely aware that I am invisible to a vast percentage of the population, I determined that the car had to be red to enable others to see (and perhaps admire) it. Then I came across the instant tax rebate section of the application with the government warning that if I claimed it and my income managed to grow miraculously, I would end up owing the government money. Yes, I did the senior citizen dodge: With visions of the IRS hounding me, I got scared; who wants the government to threaten them with fines? After I glossed over the tax rebate section, the app asked whether I was interested in a trade-in. Already having an estimate from Carvana, I indicated to Tesla that I was open to a trade-in only to be ordered to take a myriad of photos of The Josy. With my photos in its clutches, the Tesla App robot replied that my photos were not of high enough definition, leaving me to throw up my hands in disgust – after all, I had the Carvana estimate in my pocket. I clicked on the “buy now” button – and Tesla gave me only three days to finalize the details before picking it up. Now understand that buying a Tesla outright does not involve the normal ways to purchase a car: credit cards and personal checks are strictly prohibited. I drove down to Tesla and threw myself at the mercy of a Tesla expeditor – remember, Tesla is allergic to car salesmen. And this is where the story takes a happy turn. The company expected me to purchase it that day, but I explained I couldn’t. I offered to write a personal check and wait until it had cleared, an action I thought was logical, only to be told that Tesla does not accept personal checks, even ones that have cleared. Then we talked about the problems with my photos, and Shon (the Tesla expeditor) generously offered to take the required photos herself and expedite the trade-in offer. Tesla would only give me a two-day extension if I wanted to buy the Y; I reminded her that I had to wait three months for the arrival of The Josy and the parking lot was now filled with a massive number of Teslas for sale, but here Tesla was obdurate, and I, a proud member of the Silent Generation, simply caved in. The trade-in offer appeared on my Tesla App later that day, one that I quickly accepted it as it was higher than the Carvana one, and Tesla then gave me the revised amount I now owed. The bank wired the money to Wells Fargo in San Francisco, and Shon, who had warned me that it could take up to three days to have it nestled into Tesla’s account, managed to speed up that process. Two days later, Shon (who was on the lookout for me) guided me through the purchase and transfer while switching the license plate from The Josy to The Daisy (named after a beloved Airedale). I then grandly entered The Daisy and drove her back to Chapel Hill. Shon warned me that for some unaccountable reason, I had to keep The Josy on my insurance plan until I received the official registration for The Daisy from the State (which takes about a month). Now, in my elderly brain, this is what doesn’t add up: Why do I have to keep insurance on The Josy when I no longer own her? The moral of this story if you are interested in buying a Tesla, is this: Be sure to ask for Shon, who is a real person. As for the tax rebate, I’m doing what any member of my generation would do: handing it over to my accountant.

Judge advances customers’ claims that Tesla reduced vehicle battery life on purpose - Courthouse News Service,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxOS3ZaY0F2anE0UzN5dTM0a0kzMEk3M2pxWGVxNU1BbkJqWmJ3Yl9aMkpPcDhDYVhRRTk3cmVqNjJMTGcxSENiMjhUM2x5QWstTkM4SzBDTXA4aGd2dmFiX1dMUGVKd21CN0pOdmtob3o2MTlaMHNNMUdBSFdXd3NwU2g0STV3US1KSnBCaXdLSExqVXZrcXRXN2JzRDFRT3pPSDhpb2Y2U0pEOU5ESVVWS1ByeGc?oc=5,"Wed, 21 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Judge advances customers’ claims that Tesla reduced vehicle battery life on purpose     Tesla owners can pursue their claims that the company deliberately reduced their electric vehicles' battery power, but the judge stopped short of issuing an injunction.         OAKLAND, Calif. (CN) — Tesla must face claims that it intentionally installed performance updates on many of its vehicles on the road, which intentionally damaged the batteries of vehicles in many states.  U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar allowed some class claims to survive in the lawsuit filed by car owners who say the Elon Musk-cofounded company released software intended to reduce the battery life of Model S and X Tesla vehicles.  The plaintiffs adequately pleaded that Tesla knowingly updated the vehicles’ transmissions with a series of software changes which immediately damaged many cars' batteries without the owners’ permission, Tigar said in  a 16-page order  Tuesday.  However, the judge dismissed the plaintiffs' unfair competition claims, as well as a request to force Tesla to stop releasing performance updates while the litigation is underway.  “Just as past harms to the batteries are compensable with monetary damages, future harms to the battery through software updates should be equally quantifiable,” he wrote. “Plaintiffs’ conclusory allegation of Tesla’s continuing practices in its plea for relief does not establish otherwise. The court understands that plaintiffs oppose Tesla’s conduct in pushing out updates that drain their batteries, and so want the court to order Tesla to stop. But regardless of how plaintiffs may feel about the conduct, the question is whether money damages would sufficiently compensate plaintiffs for their injuries.” Tigar said the plaintiffs did not show how Tesla plans to continue these practices in the future, nor whether the company bypassed security measures to ensure its updates were downloaded. In addition, some plaintiffs downloaded the updates voluntarily.  “Although courts do not 'foreclose' claims of vitiated consent under these subsections, users who voluntarily installed software ‘have serious difficulty’ pleading unauthorized access under the CFAA, especially given the heightened pleading requirements applied in consumer-protection claims sounding in fraud,” Tigar wrote. “Plaintiffs’ allegations of misleading omissions do not establish, for example, that Tesla posed as a different entity or misdescribed the nature of the software updates to gain access to plaintiffs’ vehicle systems.” Tigar rejected most of Tesla’s attempt to toss the plaintiffs’ claims for common law trespass under the state laws of Florida, Virginia, Michigan, Washington and Arizona. Only the Texas-based claims could be dismissed, Tigar said.  The judge rejected Tesla’s contention that choice of law issues preclude the court from applying California trespass law to the plaintiffs who do not live in California. In general, conflict of law issues should be settled at the class certification stage of litigation, he said, because “choice of law analysis is a fact-specific inquiry, which requires a more developed factual record than is available at the motion to dismiss stage.” The plaintiffs may file an amended complaint within 21 days from Tuesday. If they do not, the claims already dismissed will be dismissed again with prejudice. Attorneys for both sides did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  In its  motion to dismiss  filed July 27, 2023, Tesla argued that the plaintiffs did not cite facts to show how it circumvented any technical barriers to access the software on owners’ vehicles, nor any evidence of misrepresentation or fraud Tesla committed to make the software updates.

How Tesla is banking billions in regulatory emissions credits - CBT News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMEpyaTd4U2ZnNVFsMW5iZ05ycjktZjBaQS1NU0hoS20tZVFpcGdCNHp5U2xGa0drQmh0SkUtdU9ZSUlGSU9lakJOS3M1ZHZLUjlwSGUtbXZJN1NKNW1nZUpyN0x4NldwSUZUT0RsMDRXTUpEZV9tTFl5RzRTOWNBRWN2dnZSZHk0MjNnVlpJMA?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Welcome back to the latest episode of  The Future of Automotive  on CBT News, where we put recent automotive and mobility news into the context of the broader themes impacting the industry.    I’m Steve Greenfield from  Automotive Ventures , and I’m glad that you could join us.    This week I’d like to take the opportunity to discuss how Tesla continues to cash in (to the tune of billions of dollars) on other carmakers.    These other OEMs need help to meet their emissions standards, which has effectively become a very lucrative side business for  Tesla .   Tesla generated a jaw-dropping $1.79 billion in regulatory credit revenue last year. That brought the cumulative total Tesla has raked in since 2009 to almost $9 billion.       At the beginning, the electric automaker, founded 20 years ago, was to many investors and fans the answer to climate change, especially as Elon Musk showed the world that a zero-emissions vehicle could be both cool and profitable. At one point, he said helping to reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change is why Tesla “exists.”   For a decade, Tesla was de facto the only EV manufacturer. So, they were in the advantageous position of then being able to sell carbon offset credits to other automakers, who had zero EVs in their vehicle portfolios.     Selling regulatory credits is a tidy business for Tesla. It earns them by making and selling electric vehicles, then sells the credits to manufacturers whose new-vehicle fleets exceed emissions limits set by various authorities, including in China, the European Union and the state of California.   Tesla bears little to no incremental cost earning the credits, so the sales are virtually pure profit to Tesla’s bottom line.     Tesla has brought in more than $1.7 billion each of the last two years.   It really frustrates the legacy automakers that Tesla got so much of an economic boost out of being the only purely electric car manufacturer out there. They effectively have funded the growth of their biggest EV competitor.     Recently, automakers including Volkswagen and General Motors have fallen short of their EV goals and delayed or canceled electric-vehicle manufacturing investments. Volkswagen and GM  both have needed help meeting emissions standards in recent years, as has Honda and Jaguar Land Rover.   Meanwhile, emissions rules aren’t getting any easier. Europe has set stricter car-emissions targets starting next year and from 2030 onward, while the UK adopted a zero-emission vehicle mandate beginning this year. A number of automakers–including Volvo, Buick, and Bentley, for example–have pledged to stop selling ICE vehicles by 2030.     Back here in the U.S., New Jersey became the latest state to New Jersey will require automakers to exclusively manufacture zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2035, joining a growing number of states with plans to ban internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.   If these aggressive EV mandates hold for a number of the legacy automakers, Tesla’s regulatory credit business may still have a lot more room to run.

German town votes against Tesla plans to expand ‘gigafactory’ - The Guardian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxPc2YyUzhvTlVleGZMdkVtVjZiTEwyM05HbkU1TkRjek5fZ3ZzRjM0b2R4RVYwc281eE5tYlZIUFB5S253SGYxYVF0SFNSNVVKclFWeEh0YUFnWFVibjF3VU84bFhyYTFPOW9tNm5ibjZ6WU10dDJEZ05SVC1CNlN1b0NpclE4Wjc5ZERWZVdQdFV1aGY1WEh1ajE5OTJZNHhKdXE2MnEzWk5QaWNNZHBycW1vN09PWERHc0hXLWRyMXFvbkNrTGpBSGNTUEh4MkVKQTJLMWl0eGRVSUU?oc=5,"Wed, 21 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","The people of a small German town where Elon Musk has built a  Tesla  factory have thrown a spanner in the works by rejecting plans to expand the complex. The majority of residents of Grünheide in Brandenburg, an hour’s drive south-east of Berlin, voted against proposals to build new infrastructure intended to improve access to the site and allow easier transport of the finished vehicles, including a freight depot and warehouses. A kindergarten for employees’ children was also part of the plans, which propose expanding the 300-hectare (740-acre) factory site by 170 hectares and felling about 100 hectares of pine forest in the process. Voter turnout was 76%, with 3,499 people voting against the plans, 1,882 in favour. The referendum is not legally binding, but should “serve as an orientation” for local decision-makers and Tesla bosses who have lobbied hard for the “gigafactory”. The mayor of Grünheide, Arne Christiani, and bosses of the carmaker said the vote result would now prompt them to return to the drawing board. Plans for the original plant were first announced by Musk in November 2019. Vehicle production began in March 2022, with the first electric cars rolling off the conveyor belt almost immediately. Central to objections from the start, led by a local  citizens’ initiative , is the estimated 1.8m cubic metres of groundwater required by the plant to produce between 300,000 and 500,000 cars a year. The Brandenburg region has been beset by drought for several years. Tesla has repeatedly pledged to keep water use to a minimum and to recycle its water rigorously. But local people say they fear in particular the contamination of drinking water if groundwater levels drop too low. The citizens’ initiative, which is backed by ecologists, point out that part of the planned area of expansion is in a water protection area. Christiani, an independent, told the German broadcaster RBB that he regretted the referendum’s outcome and blamed negative publicity for the result. “Seemingly it has not been possible to convey to people that further important infrastructure projects, such as a new B-road or a railway station forecourt, [need the Tesla expansion]. Now the municipality has the considerable task of trying to find solutions to this.” Alexander Schirp, the managing director of the Berlin-Brandenburg business association (UVB), also expressed his disappointment, saying: “The Tesla investment is a lucky break for Grünheide and the whole of the state of Brandenburg. “We think that rather than the risks involved, it should be the chances this investment brings with it which should be the main focus, and that includes environmental concerns.” The gigafactory, the first Tesla operation of its kind in Europe, employs about 12,500 workers. In a statement after the announcement of the referendum result, Tesla described its expansion plans as “a big win for the community”, adding that it would “seek dialogue with all participants to decide on further steps”. The company said its goal was to “enable a significant transfer of the HGV-traffic on to rail as well as generally ensuring a speedy expansion of existing infrastructure around the factory”. Tesla added that the increase in warehouse capacity would help to increase the efficiency of delivering its cars. The company had to stop production for about two weeks recently because of supply chain delays caused by attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Last month, a strike by Tesla workers in  Sweden  over collective bargaining rights became the country’s longest-running stoppage in nearly 80 years. The strike by members of the IF Metall trade union is being portrayed as the largest attempt to save Sweden’s union model from global labour practices in decades. IF Metall has more than 300,000 members across various industries in Sweden. According to the  National Mediation Office , about a third of Tesla workers in the country have taken part in the strike since it began on 27 October, resulting in the loss of an estimated 1,936 days of Swedish labour. The industrial action has attracted multiple secondary, or sympathy, strikes by unions representing among others postal workers, dock workers, electricians and painters. It has been  described as “insane” by Musk  and prompted Tesla to launch  legal action . In neighbouring Denmark, Norway and Finland, Tesla cars have been blocked at ports. On Wednesday, the Swedish trade union Seko also announced sympathy measures, saying it would stop maintenance, repairs and service of Tesla charging stations and block new connections, preparation and planning. Seko’s president, Gabriella Lavecchia, said: “IF Metall’s fight is also our fight. By refusing to comply with the rules of the game here in Sweden, Tesla is trying to gain competitive advantages by giving the workers worse wages and conditions than they would have with a collective agreement. It is of course completely unacceptable. “The fight that IF Metall is now taking is important for the entire Swedish collective agreement model. That is why we have chosen to issue another sympathy notice and increase the pressure on Tesla.”"

Tesla driver shares insights after Model 3 gets banned from racing events - Teslarati,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPczJwVWEtRElub19iZktfZnBxRDZZekswNkJHZ0lSTWFpSWxKSkJPV3dkYV8yeWdnNWppZmlJM3YxUERzYktVdWxwU1R4Rkx4MUtXZXV1dGZTdlh3VU8yeDlqLVRiVExHTUYxcWE3TDZtR0JKSjliVGtFMVlFZlJFeA?oc=5,"Sun, 25 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","There was a time when electric vehicles were not really taken seriously by automotive enthusiasts. After the original Tesla Roadster and the Model S, however, it became more and more difficult to ignore the fact that EVs can perform against combustion-powered cars in competitive events. By the time the Model 3 Performance came into the picture, the anti-EV narrative had already shifted to the idea that electric cars are only good for straight-line races, not the track.      Such narratives have become inaccurate today, with vehicles like the Tesla Model S Plaid and the Model 3 Performance being legitimate vehicles for competitive racing events. This trend could be seen in the lineup of EVs that have  shown up at Pikes Peak over the years , as well as the presence of cars like Unplugged Performance’s Model S Plaid racer, Dark Helmet, which won the event’s Exhibition Class in 2021.       Unfortunately, it would appear that electric vehicles are now being prevented from competing in some competitive driving events. As noted by Tesla driver Jon Bickford, whose Model 3 was outfitted with upgraded wheels, suspension, and brakes from EV tuning house  Unplugged Performance , he ended up being banned from the  Goodguys 2024 Autocross event . What’s ironic is that Bickford’s Model 3 previously performed very well at the event, winning five out of five shootouts last year.        “Well, after setting (the) fastest time of the show 5/5 events and winning 5/5 shootouts last year, it looks like Goodguys decided to ban me a couple weeks before the season,” the Model 3 driver noted, as shared by Unplugged Performance in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.      Interestingly enough, Bickford noted that he was also banned from competing in the Hot Rod Power Tour West Autocross event. The Model 3 owner noted that his ban was quite strange since his exhibition lap was faster than the rest of the field. His ban was also announced after he had already driven to the Hot Rod Power Tour west autocross’s location.    “I also got banned from competing in the Hot Rod Power Tour West Autocross. They let me run ‘exhibition laps.’ I was 0.626 faster than the rest of the field, but not eligible to compete. They made that decision AFTER I left San Diego at 4 a.m. and drove to Vegas motor speedway,” Bickford noted.      It is unfortunate that events like the  Goodguys 2024 Autocross  have opted to prevent electric vehicles from participating in competitive racing events. The presence of electric cars in such events, after all, drives home the notion that EVs are here to stay — and that they could beat combustion-powered cars on their own turf.      Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

Historic French EV market triumph for Tesla - Autovista24,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQUEJVNnR4ZHZmNEtvbjZPSlBabVhMRkFlUW1DSnBqeEJfNmxoT0lNSlBjR3o1UlUwX0VEUUdvMXFVQVFRRWxNbnRISWd6bXlMaThDeGZUWFJScV8wNzdlLXFBUGdRMTg2SG5lLVpFU3BvaWdUa1ZkZE1NRVljSWo1UXh4VFRNRFQ3QjU5azRzMnVUUQ?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Historic French EV market triumph for Tesla   16 February 2024     The French electric vehicle (EV) market ended 2023 on a positive note, improving on last year’s performance, with Tesla ending up on top. José Pontes, data director at EV-volumes.com, looks at how the market grew in December.     EVs  continued their growth in December. The combination of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) achieved a record 54,413 units, accounting for 30% of overall  new-car registrations . This matched its best-ever market share from  November .   BEVs made up 21% of this total. The powertrain saw deliveries up 50% year on year, thanks to a record 37,355 units. PHEVs grew 17% on December 2022, with 17,058 registrations.   In 2023, EVs took 26% of the French  new-car  market, with BEV models contributing 17%. This was an improvement from technology’s 22% share in 2022, and eight percentage points above its 2021 share.   This year should see stronger growth for EVs, with a realistic jump to between a 33% and 35% share of the overall market. This progress is needed to keep on track with the 2035  internal combustion engine (ICE) ban , after slow development in the last three years.   BEVs made up 65% of the French EV market last year, an increase on 62% from 2022. The split was more pronounced during December, with BEVs taking 69% of all EV deliveries. This figure should continue to favour the powertrain in 2024, as smaller and more affordable models come to market. This could mean BEVs end the year with an EV market share of over 70%.   Reaching this target will depend on how fast domestic brands can ramp up affordable EV models, such as the Citroen e-C3 EV and Renault 5. Another factor will be government policies. If EV incentives remain until the end of 2024, adoption should surge.   Hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) improved their market share by two percentage points to 24% last year. This means electrified models accounted for half of all  new-car registrations  in 2023, up from 44% in 2022.   Incentive influence   Heading into December, it was expected that China-built EVs would see a rush of registrations. This is because, from the start of 2024, they would no longer be eligible for EV incentives.   This prediction proved true, as the Tesla Model 3, which is manufactured in China, topped the December best-sellers table with 4,790 deliveries. The crossover was also the fourth best-selling new car overall.   The German-built  Tesla Model Y  still performed well, with 4,618 deliveries enough for second, helping the US carmaker lock out the top two spots in the table again. It also placed fifth in the overall market.   Another China-made model in the top three was the MG4, posting a record 4,138 registrations, enough for third place. However, the Dacia Spring, also produced in the country, had an average performance. It took fourth, thanks to 2,810 units taking to the roads.   Elsewhere in the EV best-seller chart for December, BMW Group had four record performances. The  Mini Cooper EV  reached eighth, claiming a best-ever 1,146 registrations. Its next generation will be made in China, meaning some buyers may have wanted to save money by purchasing the current model.   Meanwhile, the BMW iX1 in 11 th  (1,007 units) and the  BMW X1  PHEV in 17 th  (636 units) both achieved record results, as they ramped up production.   However, the best-ever figure for the  BMW i4  in 15 th  (655 units), was a surprise. Despite a previously underwhelming performance in France, it posted record numbers in multiple markets, as demand has spiked for the saloon.   In ninth came the Renault Twingo EV with 1,096 deliveries its best total in over a year. Below, the  Peugeot 308  took 10 th  (1,066 units), as its BEV version reached three digits with 108 registrations.   The best-selling PHEV in December, with a record 953 deliveries, was the  Mercedes-Benz GLA  PHEV in 12 th . It was followed by its sibling, the  Mercedes-Benz GLC  PHEV in 13 th  (713 units), and the Cupra Formentor PHEV in 14 th  (668 units). This was a record result for the latter, with its December figure higher than its total across the whole of 2022.   MG benefitted from the subsidy-ending surge in December, with its ZS EV model also making the top 20, with 628 units giving it 18 th  place. Outside the table, the MG HS PHEV also performed well, as buyers took the chance to secure Chinese-built models before the deadline. It posted its highest tally since November 2021, as 517 units took to the road.   The new Hyundai Kona EV had a strong month in 20 th  (599 units) as deliveries for its new generation picked up speed. It could perform well in 2024, as the model will not lose access to subsidies.   Outside the top 20, the Mini Countryman posted a year-best 457 deliveries. Elsewhere in its parent group, the BMW X3 recorded its best tally in 19 months (497 units). Meanwhile, its sibling, the X5 (472 units), had its highest total in three years.   Volkswagen (VW) also had a positive month, as the  ID.3  and  ID.4  saw year-best results, posting 466 and 532 registrations respectively. Furthermore, the  Golf  PHEV had its best performance since March 2021 with 378 deliveries.   Another Tesla title   The Tesla Model Y was crowned as the best-selling EV in France in 2023, with 37,127 registrations giving the crossover its first title. It also claimed eighth spot in the overall best sellers table, as well as a midsize category win.   The crossover should remain a strong contender for the top spot in 2024, as the German-made model will not lose access to subsidies this year. It can be expected to reach between 40,000 and 45,000 units this year.   However, the China-made Tesla Model 3 will lose incentive access, and its deliveries are predicted to drop. The refreshed model placed third in the EV rankings, moving up two places from November. It also took second in the overall midsize category, thanks to 24,539 deliveries.   Splitting the two Tesla offerings was the Dacia Spring, posting 29,761 registrations for its second runner-up spot in a row, and a city car category title.   There will be a new generation of the SUV in the latter half of 2024, with production moving to Europe, likely resulting in a record figure. Yet the older model is expected to slump in the year's first half, threatening its chances of surpassing 30,000 units.   The Peugeot e-208 fell to fifth at the end of the year, with a total of 22,508 units. Despite this, it still took the supermini category title. This year it could see a dip in demand as newer and more affordable models become available for buyers.   An example is the Citroen e-C3, which is expected to reach 30,000 units in 2024. This will be thanks to an affordable price tag. However, this will be dependent on a smooth ramp-up of production, with the first deliveries aiming to land in April.   Elsewhere, the  Renault 5  could also make an impact on the market. Deliveries should begin in the second half of 2024, making a top-three position a tough task this year. Yet in 2025, the hatchback should be targeting the EV top spot, alongside an overall market top three.   Making the most of the e-208’s slow month was the  Fiat 500e , which overtook the French model, as its tally of 23,525 units moved it into fourth.   In sixth, the MG4 (20,074 units) took the compact category win, in front of the Renault Megane EV (17,623 units).   Further down the rankings, the Renault Twingo EV climbed to ninth (8,505 units). This means three city car models managed a top-10 finish. The  Kia Niro  improved to 13 th  (6,715 units). The Korean crossover IS expected to disappear from the table in 2024 as it loses incentives.   Just 14 units shy of making the top 20, the VW ID.3 ended a disappointing year with 4,791 deliveries.   The best-selling full-size model in 2023 was the BMW X5, thanks to 3,032 registrations. It comfortably beat the Mercedes-Benz GLE (1,967 units), while the Audi Q8 e-Tron was the best-selling BEV in the category (872 units).   First foreign victory   Within the brand rankings, Tesla took a historical triumph in 2023, becoming the first foreign manufacturer to take the victory. During December their share rose to 13.7%, up from 13.1% in November.   This meant Peugeot was unable to retain the title, dropping to an 11.3% share from 11.9% in the previous month. This growing gap was due to the domestic brand's sluggish end to 2023, contrasted with a stronger-than-expected finish from the US carmaker.   Renault remained in third taking 7.4% of the EV market, followed by Dacia in fourth (6.5%), which edged out MG (6.4%, up from 5.9%).   Below the top five, BMW (5.6%) continued its rise, passing Fiat (5.3%) for sixth place. The German marque is expected to continue its upward trajectory in 2024, as MG loses access to subsidies.   When looking at automotive groups, with brands brought together under their parent companies, Stellantis continued to stall in December. It dropped to a 25.7% share from 27% in November.   Despite this, the group claimed the title, a long distance ahead of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance in second (14.4%). A Renault rebound is expected in 2024 to boost their share.   Tesla took third (13.7%, up from 13.1%), in front of the VW Group in fourth (11.7%). The German manufacturer could take Tesla’s position in 2024, due to the predicted delivery drop of the Model 3. Rounding out the top five was the BMW Group (8.1%)."

Most drivers see their  Tesla s make it well beyond the 100,000-mile marker, although you'd be surprised how far these can truly travel. There have been impressive write-ups on owners boasting 500,000+ miles in as little as a few years of ownership, although this  Model S  owner puts even those stories to shame.   It all started with a man named Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg, who drove his Tesla Model S between multiple countries, near and far, eventually making it well beyond the MILLION-mile mark on his Tesla's odometer. Most people average ~10,000-15,000 miles per year, so to accomplish this with a fairly new EV is incredible. Not only that, but EVs are so new to the majority of drivers, so these types of numbers prove there is a growing amount of awareness of electric capability.   That's not even considering during his time on the road, Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg didn't create a single emission. This could be another type of story had the driver owned a hybrid or non-hybrid model, but thanks to the power and range of Model S, he saw the world through his Tesla without disturbing it. That's an accomplishment in itself. We'll dive into just how much this Tesla owner *actually* drove below, so stick with us!         In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla and other authoritative sources, including the EPA and Watt Energy (YouTube).           Related      	  						2024 Tesla Model S 			   The Model S has been around for a long time, but it is still one of the most competent EVs currently on sale. Here's all you need to know about it.                                     How One Tesla Model S Owner Made It 1,181,268 Miles                   When Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg purchased his Tesla Model S in 2014, he would never know what the next decade of electric driving would look like. Although he purchased his electric sedan with 18,641 miles, this would soon be a drop in the bucket of his total mileage. Hornberg had decided to start a multi-year road trip, visiting countries across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.   Because of his Tesla Model S and its  high-performance specs , this owner was able to make it across the globe in style, as well as explore many roads less traveled.  EV battery anxiety is always a thing  for Tesla owners, although Hornberg doesn't seem to mind the 265.                This Record Is Thanks To A Model S P85        It's worth noting that Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg​​​​​ bought a Tesla Model S P85 back in 2014, pre-owned, and its  range falls at 265 miles  per full charge.  With 88 MPGe in the city and 90 on the highway , this Tesla was known to be one of the more battery-efficient of the lineup. Even when 2014 rang in, and this model had not yet become the household name it is now, Model S (more specifically, the P85) was a knight in shining armor for Hornnerg. Many years and millions of miles later, this Tesla is still kicking and telling its tale.                Tesla Model S P85 Specs                  Motor       Single electric motors           Horsepower       373-416 horses           Torque       325-443 pound-feet           Driveline       RWD           Battery       85 kWh lithium-ion           Range       265 miles           Used Price In 2024        $13,977 to $29,990 ( current market pricing )             (Table specs sourced from Tesla and Truecar)   It's also worth noting that the 2014 edition of Model S goes for a decent second-hand price, so you don't have to go with a new release to get many, many, many miles. This sedan is luxurious and offers plenty of great driving features, so regardless, you're stepping into a great model with proven reliability.         Related     Teslas aren't considered the most reliable cars. If you're looking to buy a used one, you've got to know about the most common problems.                                     This Gentleman's Model S Saw Multiple Continents And Countries                       Not only did Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg get the most out of his Model S in Europe (where he is from), but he also made it to the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.  This is not only great PR from a potential customer standpoint  but also goes to show that through the years, electric infrastructure has grown to be more accessible throughout the world. We know Asia and Europe are up to speed, but seeing Hornberg make it through countries like Morocco is a great push in the right direction for electric mobility as a whole. Nearly 1.2 million miles later, the Tesla Model S is still finding new ways to stay busy.                The Model S, Although Not As Popular As Model 3 Or Y, Is A Winner        If there's one thing that the P85 has shown us, it is that  the Model S is a great sedan for long-distance and long periods  of ownership and driving. Even with the 2014 edition going 265 miles per full charge, this was still impressive for that era, far before you saw as much competition and ability within the EV realm. Now, you have Tesla's going 300+ miles with no issue at the standard level and close to 400 with long-range batteries. Ah, how times have changed.         Related     The Tesla Model Y has encountered reliability concerns with recalls and complaints. Take a look at these before making your decision.                                    It Took Several Battery Replacements To Reach 1.2 Million Miles                                       Watt Energy via YouTube         Something worth knowing about  this incredible Model S  and its odometer hitting well beyond a million is that the owner has mentioned getting the battery replaced three times, plus 13 motor swap outs. Of course, in perspective, even that small of a number for battery servicing goes to show this vehicle has been engineered for the long haul.   Doing the math, you could say this Model S saw 393,756 miles before needing a new battery and roughly 90,867 miles between motor replacements. That itself is pretty spectacular: 2014 especially. We're not talking about a spring chicken here. This baby is ten years old!                The Average EV Needs A New Battery Every 10 Years        Although this battery lifespan depends on the driver and conditions of everyday mobility, most electric models need a  new battery after 150,000-200,000 miles . Therefore, this Model S only needs a new battery put in per ~400,000 miles is AWESOME news for those not wanting to service their car as frequently as other electric and non-EV brands. Tesla uses high-quality, 85 kWh lithium-ion batteries  for this generation of S , and even to this day, drivers can't get enough of them.         Most EVs see at least 100,000 miles without failing, even reaching 15-year ownership without battery replacements. Compared to ICE vehicles, which have an average life expectancy of ~12 years, that makes electric powertrains longer lasting before major repairs and swap outs.               Related     Tesla is one of the largest EVmakers in the world, and here are all the costs you need to consider when you plug your Tesla in to charge.                                    Hansjörg Owns Yet Another Tesla Model He Loves To Drive                                       Tesla         On top of the now iconic Model S Hansjörg owns, he also boasts a first-generation Roadster with around 456,700 miles on the clock. There's clearly something about him and Teslas. After all, cars are meant to be driven, so it's great to see someone go the distance (literally) with their EV. As of 2024, this remains the  Tesla with the most mileage  EVER, so that calls for some type of shout-out from Elon and the gang. Maybe a free Model S for another million-plus miles?                Tesla Outperforms The Competition In Lifespan And Driving Quality        Even though Tesla has had its fair share of troubles and competition becoming steeper, that shouldn't discount what the brand has been able to accomplish in terms of  overall reliability and ingenuity for customers . The Model S has not ever  kicked off like the Model 3  or Y have, but that's not to discount its prowess.   This story of a Model S from a decade ago making ~1.2 million miles is one we hope is replicated in the coming years, especially as we begin to see Teslas from more modern releases hit these milestones. At battery number four, we can only hope that Hansjörg von Gemmingen-Hornberg sees two million miles recorded in his favorite Tesla."

The alleged defect ups the risk of a crash and injury.     If the investigation leads to a Tesla recall, it could affect an estimated 334,569 vehicles, including:      2023 Tesla Model 3  2023 Tesla Model Y       Investigation summary       The regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), opened a preliminary investigation on July 28, 2023, following 12 complaints about cars losing power steering.   While investigating, the agency uncovered over 2,300 complaints alleging the same thing and received information about a crash associated with the defect.   Steering racks provided by Tesla were identified as the culprit.   The regulator is now taking the investigation to the next level, where it aims to discover what causes the racks to fail.   Risks   Jammed or otherwise inoperable steering makes the vehicle difficult to control, increasing the risk of a crash and injury.   ‘Significant problems with the steering wheel’   Complaints submitted to NHTSA talk about the steering wheel locking up or becoming “exceedingly stiff” in brand new cars. Drivers had to use “immense manual power” to move the vehicle and reported being “lucky” that these incidents did not occur on major highways.   Safety tips   “Multiple complaints” mentioned that the driver could “temporarily” remedy the problem by turning the car on and off.    Warning signs    The loss-of-steering incidents were sometimes accompanied by a “Steering Assist Reduced” warning message and clicking sounds while turning.    Other Tesla recalls   In January, Tesla recalled  more than 2 million of their electric cars because they may crash into first-responder vehicles while  cruising on autopilot.     This month,  the manufacturer recalled some of the same cars due to “insufficiently visible display messages, ” as reported.   Is your vehicle a part of a recall?   This investigation may eventually lead to a Tesla steering loss recall, potentially affecting more than 330,000 electric cars.

Is Tesla's Cybertruck the new status car? - Business Insider,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQek9GYm80NWt5UHVwRzBXQnNMcWw4X3VPanlQVWxaeFAzQldBd3Zrbzc1TUg3M3VvalRKVjhzV0ppSmZHR1dzTkF6R2Y1QmxLbTJ1cTU1X1gyQTZHdF8tdS14NEpvSXVtbk9ucF9RZFJQdTJTLWh2V3pKR0F5a21qRkFQbm16dDlTNmZiY1BrSXFFRXU5UklDVkdVWQ?oc=5,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla's Cybertruck  isn't the kind of car that goes unnoticed. Its boxy shape makes it look like something from a movie set in the future, and at more than 18 feet long, its sheer size makes it difficult to miss. This is exactly why it didn't go unnoticed that during the past few weeks, celebrities like  Kim Kardashian  and Pharrell Williams have posted their Cybertruck on Instagram. Jay-Z seems to have wrapped the truck in matte black with an all-white customized interior, and Bad Bunny was spotted pulling up to his concert in the EV. Most recently, Hayley and Justin Beiber took theirs to church. (Not all celebrity reviews have been glowing. Wiz Khalifa, who doesn't appear to own a Cybertruck, said it looks ""like it came with pre-dirt on it."") ""Inherently, a status symbol is something that will turn heads, and it's difficult not to turn heads in the Cybertruck,"" Ivan Drury, an automotive analyst for Edmunds, told Business Insider. But it's also possible that it was a fad that was at least partly manipulated by  Tesla  itself. "" Elon Musk  would've done this to put it in the hands of people who will be photographed driving it and obviously provide it a certain association,"" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a London consulting firm focused on the wealthy, told BI. ""He clearly knows because he bought a social media platform, the power of celebrity."" Whether it was a grand marketing plan or not, it has worked. People are talking and taking notice. ""It's got this image of a must,"" Chesterfield said. ""If you are a high-end person that wants to be seen around, you have to have the Cybertruck."" The Cybertruck isn't your average pickup Musk has been hyping up the Cybertruck  since it was announced in 2019. ""It will be the biggest product launch of anything by far on Earth this year,"" he said last year, adding that he thinks it's  Tesla's ""best product."" But when the Cybertruck was  finally delivered  — the first batch of about a dozen, two years late — it left many  Tesla fans disappointed . It cost  $20,000 more than expected  and didn't have the 500-mile range that was promised. But that hasn't seemed to deter certain members of the rich and famous. From the start, it's been clear the Cybertruck isn't geared toward your  traditional pickup truck market . With its focus on design and lack of attention to things like range and functionality, some experts say it wasn't really made for the typical pickup truck driver. Ahead of the product's release, the carmaker tacked on (and then quickly backtracked) a  $50,000 resale fee , a fine designed to prevent Cybertruck owners from flipping the EV for a much higher price within the first year of owning it. It's typically a clause associated with higher-end, limited edition vehicles like the Ford GT — not readily available vehicles designed to cater to the everyday worker.                                        Related stories                                                Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know               Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know             ""I make trucks for real people who do real work, and that's a different kind of truck,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a dig last year, dubbing the Cybertruck a vehicle for  ""Silicon Valley people."" But it's not exactly your typical luxury status car, either While the Cybertruck isn't a traditional pickup, it's not exactly a luxury car. Its interior, for example, is very minimalistic compared to those of other luxury cars, lacking ultra-high-end features like a massage chair, champagne chiller, or built-in safe. ""It's not a work truck, but it's also not a luxury thing,"" Brian Moody, an executive editor at Autotrader, said. ""It doesn't have any of the luxury amenities you'd expect. The inside is actually very plain."" And while it's exclusive given the sheer number available at the moment, owning it does not, inherently, mean you're very wealthy. The Cybertruck has a starting price of $61,000. That's much lower than the price of other status cars like the Mercedes G-Wagon and Rolls Royce Ghost, which have starting prices of $143,000 and $348,000, respectively. Owning one of those basically proves you have significant disposable income. That scarcity factor — which tends to attract the status-oriented — is set to fade. Musk has said the carmaker aims to ramp up production to a level that Tesla will produce about  250,000 Cybertrucks per year by 2025. A status car tends to be ""something that there's a very small number of,"" Chesterfield said. In this way, the Cybertruck is similar to other Tesla models which have started out as status symbols. Before the Model 3 and Model Y became mainstream vehicles, celebrities like Ben Affleck, Cameron Diaz, Will Smith, and  Oprah Winfrey  were  showing off  their Teslas. The brand's image has changed as the company has continued to pump out more cars (it delivered over 1.7 million  Model 3  and Model Ys last year) and slash prices. It's no longer Hollywood A-listers like Morgan Freeman or Steven Spielberg pulling up to a red-carpet event in a Tesla, it's your  Uber driver  or next-door neighbor. ""The Model 3 and Model Y have become so popular that it's like driving a Camry,"" Drury said. ""If Tesla hits the goals Musk has set for the Cybertruck, it'll become just as commonplace."" Is Tesla behind the Cybertruck's sudden visibility? In short, it seems like even Tesla doesn't know the Cybertruck's target demographics, Moody said. Perhaps the reason we've seen it posted by so many prominent celebrities is that the company is trying to make that group its target demographic, either by giving them a car or offering to move them up on the waitlist. The company traditionally doesn't advertise and isn't known to have given away cars before, and it didn't respond to a request for comment from BI. Tesla only  began advertising  last year. The carmaker has primarily relied on Musk's celebrity status to market the cars, but the billionaire's popularity has been fading since he  took over Twitter. The practice of bumping celebrities and the wealthy up on a waitlist or making them brand ambassadors is pretty typical, Moody said, adding that it isn't clear if Tesla is taking part in this type of marketing. ""There is almost guaranteed he put it earlier in the hands of those people because they were higher profile,"" Chesterfield said. ""It basically means from day one, people associate the Cybertruck, which obviously is a very odd looking vehicle, with high-end celebrities, international celebrities, music stars, sports stars."" When this theory was recently raised, Musk said on Twitter that no one, including him, receives discounts on Teslas or is paid to promote the company's products. ""Well, they clearly have great taste!"" he  said . Musk, himself, is an international celebrity — with many  very wealthy friends  and fans who would love to be seen in his latest creation. ""The finance geeks are just, they're beside themselves of how much they admire"" Musk, Chesterfield said. ""That would probably be reflected in them buying the vehicles and making sure they absolutely have their order in for a Cybertruck."" But there are just as many people who  won't buy Teslas  due to the Musk association, he added, which could be almost as big an obstacle as its divisive look in cementing the Cybertruck standing as a status symbol. ""When you roll up in a Cybertruck, you're either the coolest kid in town or the most hated person around, and you just have no idea which until you start looking at all the faces around you,"" YouTube car reviewer Kyle Conner  said . ""It's a really polarizing vehicle."""

(Eric Gay/Associated Press)       [Stay on top of transportation news:  Get TTNews in your inbox .]   Tesla  Inc. is likely years away from fully ramping a new lower-cost model, which will take the company longer than Wall Street is assuming,  Evercore  analysts said after touring the carmaker’s Texas factory.       	  			               “Tesla increasingly is a ‘2027 story,’ ” Evercore analysts led by  Chris McNally  wrote in a report March 11. He questioned whether the best-case scenario for a cheaper vehicle colloquially referred to as Model 2 is more like 500,000 units in 2026 rather than a consensus of 1 million-plus.       	  			               CEO  Elon Musk  has said Tesla is “between two major growth waves,” with the first underpinned by the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover and the second expected from a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. The company expects to start production of this EV toward the end of 2025 at its plant in Austin.       	       The next-gen model’s bill of materials will decline from $28,000 to $20,000 and likely have around 250 miles of range and no glass roof, McNally wrote. A “big debate” will be whether Tesla’s driver-assistance hardware will be standard, he said, citing his team’s belief that the hardware could cost $2,000 to $3,000.       	  			               Evercore now expects Tesla to deliver around 2.7 million vehicles in 2026, meaning its estimate for earnings per share that year is now 18% to 20% below consensus.

Tesla, run by CEO and budding  Bond villain  Elon Musk, is refusing to reach a collective bargaining agreement with the mechanics at its Swedish repair shops.   The mechanics have been on strike against Tesla since October 27 and union representatives from around the world traveled to Sweden this week to support them. On Tuesday, the UAW’s Peter shared this message with the Swedish strikers:     I bring solidarity, and support, from the one million members and retirees of the United Auto Workers.   You inspire all of us with your fight against corporate greed and the billionaire class. The billionaire class that wants to tear down the social democracy that Swedish workers have built.   You are holding the line against Elon Musk – the billionaire who represents everything that is wrong with the global economy. He busts union. He hoards wealth. And more and more, he sides with the reactionary forces that want to end democracy around the world.   Together, we will stop him.   Your fight here at Tesla shows that solidarity is stronger than the world’s richest man.   And last year, in our Stand Up Strike against America’s automakers, UAW members showed solidarity is stronger than any company.   When workers stand up together, we win our fair share of the wealth we create. And by standing together here today, we will win this fight against Elon Musk and Tesla."

Tesla and CATL to expand cooperation amidst rapidly changing US strategy - Global Fleet,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxOeDAzU09vQUdUa2J6Q2FHNTZBOWozYV81QUhET2ZDRXpfU1NPMmR0WllhVkl4RFBrdVo4Ull1bllIVFdhS0RhS1dqZDdzV0VDVlpFdEJaU2FVV20wQllXMlFJdG52cHVLQTZSM2t3dm9Qa2FiVWpZNmt0X05GQkJPMVI4RzFPbmt5RHRIQV9QYTVMSnF5LXd3cWtYR3o3UnEtZ1VRTkhmSUJlYzFFRFZhOTlQYjh1aW1qNS16NkhORUxQMzdrWjhVWjFR?oc=5,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Two giants of the global electric vehicle (EV) market are eager to expand cooperation for mutual benefits, but the national electrification strategy of the US government may change plans.    According to the Chinese media,  Tesla  and  CATL  are working on a new battery called M3P and plan to use it on Tesla vehicles, but there is no confirmation yet. On the other hand, local media reports say CATL has already begun testing the battery on a vehicle jointly developed by Chery (a state-owned auto manufacturer). The full-electric Luxeed S7 will be the first battery-electric vehicle (BEV) with M3P.    The idea of using an M3P lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) battery surfaced again last year in the Chinese media, which claimed that Tesla plans to use the battery to boost the range in the Tesla Model 3 Project Highland edition.    CATL said the M3P battery will go into mass production and use in 2023. During 2022, there were reports that the new battery would be installed in the Tesla line-up in China, including the new  Model Y , but no announcement verifying these statements came last year. However, the M3P battery debuted with the Luxeed S7, produced by Chery and Huaewii and launched in November 2023.    Most recent reports say that CATL and Tesla are still developing the M3P battery, and it is unclear when they will be used in Tesla cars in China.    Still no M3P in the new Model 3   According to Teslarati, 'Project Highland' has been on Tesla's agenda since Q2 2022. In November of that year, Reuters revealed that Tesla was working on an upgrade to the Tesla Model 3, which would result in a different powertrain and exterior design. Reports on M3P indicate that the upgrade includes the battery, intended to increase the China-sold Tesla Model 3 capacity from 60 kW/h to 66 kW/h.    In 2022, CATL said the new LFP battery design has around 15% higher density than the current LFP batteries with 210 Wh/kg (watt-hour per kilogram). The M3P battery is expected to provide 700 km charge on a single charge, whereas the Model 3 RWD (rear-wheel drive), sold in China, ranges around 556 km. The M3P battery uses the ternary design, interacting with a positive electrode of three elements. For the M3P, lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) is highly favoured. Yet, there still needs to be more clarity about the cathode and anode materials of the M3P battery.    LFP batteries use lithium iron phosphate as the cathode material and graphite or other carbon materials for the anode. According to the most recent reports, the M3P cathode material comprises ternary lithium and lithium manganese iron phosphate, increasing durability and internal resistance.    In June 2023, it was rumoured that the new Model Y and the Model 3 Highland would be equipped with the M3P battery. Model 3 Highland was released in Europe and several parts of the world in August 2023 and the US in January 2024. The specs for the two models are:            2024 Tesla Model 3 Highland       Model   Rear-wheel drive   Long Range        Battery   57.5 kW/h  (271 hp)   75 kW/h (349 hp)       Range (EPA)*   437 km   576 km       Range (WLTP)**   513 km   629 km       Charging speed    Up to 282 km in 15 minutes   Up to 282 km in 15 minutes       Max power input   170 kW    250 kW       *U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  			**Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure             Tesla is building on the technical know-how   According to Bloomberg, the LFP chemistry-based battery plans will pick up speed as CATL plans to establish a small LFP battery cell facility in collaboration with Tesla in Nevada. The report does not provide insight into the partnership, but it says CATL engineers will only be involved in setting up the equipment, and Tesla will manage the factory and take care of all the costs.    This is a critical move for Tesla. While the EV giant has reached mass production for its lithium-ion NCM (nickel-cobalt-manganese) battery with  Panasonic , the LFP chemistry is enabled for the first time in  North America  through the strategic partnership with CATL, boosting Tesla's technical know-how. The new facility is expected to produce LFP battery cells for Tesla Megapacks, the massive, stationary energy storage units.    Political unease    It is not only Tesla that is keen on mastering LFP  battery technology . In February 2023,  Ford  announced a $3.5 bn investment to establish an  LFP plant  with CATL's support in technical know-how. Following this development, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party asked for details for the Ford-CATL collaboration, stating that 'US taxpayer dollars should support domestic manufacturers, not foreign entities', according to Reuters. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), launched in 2022, the US government aims to focus entirely on the local supply chain.    In November 2023, Ford decided to shrink the initially announced investment by 40% for the planned factory.    According to Reuters, in September 2023, the US House Committee on Ways and Means demanded information from CEO Elon Musk about whether Tesla has contracts with CATL or is considering having contracts. Apparently, the US government is strict about collaborating with Chinese companies. Still, the strong ties between Tesla and CATL and the role of the Chinese EV ecosystem in the  global supply chain  are also apparent.    The US government's policy is also paying off. In February, Duke Energy, an electric and natural gas supplier with over 8 million customers, announced that it would nullify its partnership with CATL in military and civilian energy storage technologies and use domestic suppliers.    CATL's share in the global EV battery market rose to 37.4% in November 2023 from 36.9% in October, with an increasing number of partners worldwide, including BMW, Volvo, Li Auto, Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai and NIO.    It appears that geopolitics will continue to influence US-Chinese EV relations. The rising question is how the US will be able to flourish the domestic supply chain without the cheaper Chinese technology. The road to domestic transformation may not be cheap or short, but it is a crucial goal nonetheless.    The main photo is courtesy of Tesla."
It's pretty clear: Elon Musk's play for OpenAI was a desperate bid to save Tesla - Business Insider,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOU2cyMlVMY0puVnZnTnBLLUpKa3RwTF9QZXhKMWcwSkV5YUV6SEw4V1RtdUV1bWdjaXRLNkVnUTBpV0lyNlVnQnd6YlNiVExyXzQybjk2N2ViVXNBZXdDTDhfcU5Ub3hlZHFNVkJBVFBTdm9IaS1tYVZjWGR5c1M4Qmh5Y3FYR1dRRXFJMzduTDUyQlZLc0U3c1NPcw?oc=5,"Sun, 10 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT","We know that  Elon Musk was very desperate  back in 2018. We know that  Tesla was near death  as it struggled to build the Model 3, the car that was supposed to be the company's saving grace. We know that the development process was running late and over budget, so Musk needed capital. What we did not know was that during this tumultuous period, Musk was also working on a deal to take over OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence startup that created ChatGPT and is now worth $86 billion. We did not know he'd suggested that OpenAI raise $1 billion, merge with Tesla, and name him CEO. And we did not know that he was selling this structure to OpenAI's founders as their company's last, best, and maybe only hope for survival. But now, thanks to OpenAI's present-day fight with Musk, we know these things. And it's not hard to see how Musk's two desires — saving Tesla and wresting control of Open AI — are connected. He's angry at OpenAI for giving other investors the opportunity to invest in a powerful company he wanted for himself. But he never approached OpenAI and its founders as respected business partners; he approached them like a frat boy who puts down girls he's interested in because he's terrified of rejection. Musk's overtures came to light on Tuesday when  OpenAI published a blog post  detailing the company's relationship and communications with Musk dating back to its formation in 2015. The blog post was a response to Musk's decision to sue OpenAI, accusing it of breaching its contract to remain a nonprofit. (The company created a ""capped profit"" division in 2019 to attract investors and pay top-tier AI talent.) The blog post and emails indicate that in 2015, Musk pushed the OpenAI founders Greg Brockman and Sam Altman to raise far more money than they felt they needed to. The duo wanted to start by gathering $100 million from investors, but Musk pushed them to raise $1 billion to compete with megacompanies like Google and Facebook (now Meta). The emails also indicate that by 2017, contrary to Musk's accounts, the Tesla CEO didn't have a problem with OpenAI becoming for-profit as long as he could take control of the company. In February 2018, Musk even suggested merging OpenAI with Tesla, saying that the automaker could be OpenAI's ""cash cow"" and that Tesla was ""the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google."" It was an extremely aggressive sell to Altman and Brockman — very "" come with me if you want to live "" vibes. But it was really Tesla that desperately needed a lifeline. Musk clearly saw OpenAI's potential to raise capital, and, coincidentally, that's what he needed right then. It's also clear he saw the importance of keeping OpenAI's technology a secret, as long as the secret was in his hands. 2018 was a very bad year for Tesla In February 2018, while Musk was shooting off merger missives to OpenAI, Tesla was in the thick of ""production hell"" on the Model 3,  bleeding money  and falling  behind schedule . In the company's conference call in May 2018, Musk  flipped out on an analyst  for asking a ""boring, bonehead"" question. The question was about how much money Tesla thought it was going to spend to get through the Model 3 launch — you know, business-critical, very-important-to-investors stuff. Musk didn't have an answer, just steam.                                        Related stories                                                Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know               Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know             That June, Tesla  laid off 9% of its staff . At the same time, Musk's expensive attempt to turn his factory into a fully robotic ""alien dreadnought"" fell apart, and  cars were instead being put together  in a tent. In August, Musk falsely claimed he had financing lined up to take Tesla private for $420 a share. That month, the company reported  wider losses  than expected. After the Model 3 finally rolled off the assembly line, the car got stuck in delivery hell. Getting the Model 3 to Tesla's customers turned into a poorly planned, poorly executed logistical nightmare. Cars were so delayed that Tesla was spending a fortune on expedited shipping, and Musk was frantic to  lower costs . He asked Tesla employees from all parts of the company to  go personally deliver the cars to customers  on their  days off . Slowly, Tesla started to  make a little profit  — but not enough to make up for the year's losses, especially since it was deeply in debt. The company limped into 2019 with a  sinking stock price , a few executive departures, and an admission from Musk — on a closed call with select reporters — that Tesla would not be profitable in the first half of that year. That spring, Musk claimed that Tesla would have  1 million robotaxis  on the road in a year. Getting the Shanghai plant operational by the end of 2019 gave Tesla the opportunity to sell into China's booming electric-vehicle market and massively cut costs. Thanks to China, 2020 was the company's  first year of annual profit .     Musk was willing to go to any length to save Tesla. What's a little bullying, negging, smoke and mirrors?      Despite the Model 3 chaos, Musk continued to position himself as OpenAI's savior. In a December 2018 email, he implied to Altman and the other executives that without him and Tesla, their work would never come to fruition. ""My probability assessment of OpenAI being relevant to DeepMind/Google without a dramatic change in execution and resources is 0%. Not 1%. I wish it were otherwise,"" he wrote, adding, ""This needs billions per year immediately or forget it."" Obviously, no one forgot it — especially not Musk. Now he's suing OpenAI because, contrary to his saber-rattling, the company's explosion since the introduction of ChatGPT has it ascendant in the most exciting field in tech, while Tesla is yet again in a moment of weakness. Tesla's stock went on a glorious tear from 2019, after the Shanghai factory opening, through 2023. It was one of what Wall Street called the ""Magnificent 7"" tech companies leading the rally in stocks. But over the past few months, Tesla has diverged from the rest of the group. China's economy is slowing, and America's  electric-vehicle market  has slowed as well. Tesla is in a price war that has thinned margins, and sales are down. In a conference call in January after Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings — a miss — Musk didn't seem to have a plan for getting through this period. Plus, he still has to pay for the money suck that is X. So now Musk is turning back to OpenAI, hoping the latest charmless offensive can help shore up his empire. As much as Musk positioned himself as a white knight in 2018, Tesla was in dire straits. Musk was willing to go to any length to save Tesla. What's a little bullying, negging, smoke and mirrors? His belief that he alone can fix anything, combined with a relentless desire for control, eventually turns all negotiations into a ""my way or the highway"" scenario. Perhaps that's why Musk's pitches to OpenAI have all the finesse of a flailing balloon man outside a used-car lot where everything, absolutely everything, must go! If Musk indeed believed OpenAI needed him or Tesla to succeed, he was as belligerent about it as he was wrong.

It featured a progressive design, exceptional performance, and a host of advanced tech facilities. Over the years, the company improved its offering, making it one of the best EVs you can buy. The only issue for some buyers is its price, which is too steep.    Targeting more budget-conscious EV customers, Tesla unveiled the Model 3 in 2017. It boasts much of the same charm as its big brother at a more affordable price point. Thanks to its excellent range, performance, tech, and value-for-money proposition, the Model 3 is now the world’s best-selling zero-emission vehicle, with sales numbers beating all other cars in the company’s lineup. Plus, it received a significant facelift for 2024.   While both sedans are exceptional, there are some key differences between them. Here, we make a proper Tesla Model S vs. Model 3 comparison to determine which EV may suit you best.    2024 Model S and 2024 Model 3 MSRP:   First, the latest pricing was taken directly from Tesla’s US and Canadian sites as of March 2024. US deliveries for the Model 3 Base will be in March 2024 and the Model 3 Long Range in May 2024; both Model S deliveries are set for March 2024.

Performance & Power   Model 3 Specs   2024 Tesla Model 3   The latest  Tesla Model 3 received a significant 2024 update  and comes in two variants:     Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) : This version is the more affordable, continuing the tradition of balancing performance, range, and price.   Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD) : Also known as the  Long Range AWD  version, this variant provides enhanced performance, including quicker acceleration and potentially more significant range, compared to the RWD version.     The Tesla Model 3 offers two distinct driving experiences tailored to different preferences and needs. The Long Range variant, equipped with dual motor all-wheel drive, stands out for its superior range of approximately 340 miles or 548 km and quick acceleration, achieving 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.4 seconds. In contrast, the Standard Range version offers a practical balance with its rear-wheel drive configuration, providing a respectable 272 miles or 438 km range and a 0 to 100 km/h acceleration time of 6.1 seconds.   The Model 3 Before 2024   For those buying a used model, the Model 3 was available in three variants before the 2024 update, offering different ranges and performance ratings. The least expensive  Standard Range Plus  came with an EPA-estimated range of 272 miles, zooming to 60 mph from a standstill position in 5.8 seconds, and topping out at 140 mph.    2022 Tesla Model 3   The mid-level  Long Range   AWD  delivered 358 miles between charges and could sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds on its way to a top speed of 145 mph.    The flagship  Performance  Model 3 delivers 38 miles less than the Long Range, i.e., 315 miles, while delivering quicker acceleration. You can expect it to hit 60 mph in only 3.1 seconds and max out at 162 mph.   2022 Spec Rear-Wheel Drive Long Range Performance Range 272 mile 358 miles 315 miles Cargo 23 cu ft 23 cu ft 23 cu ft Drivetrain RWD AWD (dual motor) AWD (dual motor) 0-60 mph 5.8 sec 4.2 sec 3.1 sec Top Speed 140 mph 145 mph 162 mph   Model S Specs ( Plaid and Plaid+ )   2024 Tesla Model S   Tesla offers two flavours of the high-performance Model S:     Model S : the dual motor all-wheel drive version with the most range of the two Model S variants.   Model S Plaid : the tri-motor all-wheel drive performance version with a whopping 1,020 horsepower.     For the 2024 Tesla Model S, the Long Range variant boasts a range of up to 405 miles per charge, while the Plaid version offers slightly less at 359 miles. Performance-wise, the standard Model S can reach 60 mph in 2.4 seconds, with the Plaid model achieving this in just 2.1 seconds.   The Model S Before 2024   The more affordable, entry-level  Long Range  Model S in 2022 performed better than its little sibling. It delivered 40 miles of range with a 0-60 mph time of 3.1 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph. That’s 52 miles extra than the Long Range Model 3 and 10 mph quicker. If that’s still not enough, Tesla offered the Plaid.   2022 Tesla Model S. Photo: Tesla   In the last quarter of 2020, the American electric automaker revealed the tri-motor  Plaid  model, which boasts a 396-mile range, a 0-60 time of 1.99 seconds, and a top speed of 200 mph. Tesla initially planned to offer the Plaid+ version with 520+ miles of range but later dropped the idea.    2022 Spec Model  S Model S Plaid Range 405 mile 396 miles Cargo 23 cu ft 23 cu ft Drivetrain AWD (dual motor) AWD (tri motor) 0-60 mph 3.1 sec 1.99 sec Top Speed 155 mph 200 mph   Power is worlds apart    The 2022 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus had a single-motor rear-wheel-drive layout and generated 283 hp (211 kW). The Long Range AWD and Performance AWD offered 449 hp and 480 hp, respectively. Tesla had ensured the Model S reigned supreme in the power department of sedans. The dual-motor Long Range variant yields 670 horsepower, while the tri-motor Plaid creates a whopping 1,020 horsepower, even better than most supercars at the time and still today.    The 2022 models.   Model 3 and Model S Exterior & Interior Differences   Size sets them apart   2024 Model S:   In 2024, Tesla’s Model S and Model 3 continue to differentiate in size and features. While the Model S remains larger than the Model 3, with dimensions of 198 inches in length and a wheelbase of 118 inches, both vehicles offer ample passenger legroom compared to the Model 3’s 186 inches in length and 115-inch wheelbase.   2024 Tesla Model S   Despite its larger size, the Model S retains its maneuverability advantage due to its shorter wheelbase, making it easier to navigate tight spaces and park in urban environments.   In terms of wheel options, the Model S now offers 20-inch or 22-inch performance wheels, while the Model 3 Standard and Long Range models come equipped with 19-inch or 20-inch wheels, with 21-inch wheels available for the performance variant.   Both models continue to offer the option of a tinted glass roof, enhancing their sleek and modern aesthetic appeal. The Model S maintains its distinctive slimline front grille, adding to its eye-catching design and distinguishing it from the Model 3.   2022 Model S :   The utterly obvious dissimilarity between the two Tesla sedans is their size. The Model S is bigger (196 vs. 184.8 length and 116.5 vs. 113.2 wheelbase) and heavier than the Model 3, but there isn’t much difference in the legroom (34.2/Model 3 versus 35.4/Model S). The shorter wheelbase of the Model 3 makes it easier to maneuver and park in tight spaces.   2022 Tesla Model S   Furthermore, the S offers 19″ or 21″ performance wheels while the Model 3 Standard and Long Range models sport 18″ or 19″ and 20″ on the performance variant. Both sedans offer the option of a tinted glass roof and look stunning, but the 2022 Model S slimline front grille is still a head-turner.    Inside the Tesla cabins   The biggest attraction inside the new Tesla Model S is its 17-inch portrait touchscreen in the center, which Tesla also chose for the Model 3 but in 15-inch size. Besides, the Model 3 has a full steering wheel, which we usually find in other mainstream vehicles, but the Model S boasts the notorious ‘yoke’ steering we mostly see in Formula 1 cars. Is this yoke steering a good choice for a premium sedan? Different people have different opinions on it, but most drivers felt to adjust to the design in a short time.   Here’s our entire piece on the  2022 Tesla Model S interior .    Importantly, though, you may feel that every detail in the interior is a little improved in the Model 3. While the earlier Model S had some built quality issues, the new interiors have evolved and complemented the vehicle’s exterior appearance.    Besides having a 17-inch horizontal touchscreen, the Model S offers more cargo space – 28 cubic feet compared to a mere 15 cubic feet on the Model 3. The bigger luxury sedan also features a HEPA air filtration system to thwart viruses, bacteria, pollution, and smells from entering inside.   YouTuber, Jon Rettinger, is a popular tech reviewer and does a solid  interior review in his 2021 video here .   Takeaway: which Tesla sedan should you buy?   Selecting between the two Teslas is never easy. The old-timer Model S is undoubtedly an excellent choice for a roomy sedan with good cargo space and unparalleled performance, but it is expensive. The refreshed model has many updates that make the offering more lucrative but add extra dough to an already expensive car.   In contrast, the Model 3 is a smaller and relatively slower alternative, presenting a decent range and performance at a reasonable price. It is why it has become the best-selling all-electric car in many countries with consistently strong sales. Plus, it’s been significantly updated for 2024.   Choosing the Standard Range Plus Model 3 is a no-brainer, considering the price factor. Pay a few more thousand dollars for dual-motor trim levels for better range and performance.    Being a fresh sedan with a"
"Love it or hate it, Tesla Cybertruck turns heads in Seattle as GeekWire test drives futuristic EV - GeekWire",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxOTXJrY1pZOGFDaHJIRE1tNWNlOGF1bGF0TjZJWEhsd2l0c09zd3pTbkJFOGJ1TjlXRHRTRDFMUFpmbldEc19reDRVQTU1UENqLTdNSmlaVkdRbXRNTmRuQjF3ay15dFo1bGJqekNwSkw3WS1VeTZTWTZtamdIZTAtMUFoTWxRbUZTbDAtNUt4Q1hRamx1RU9qclNjUU5SaXlDUVVFLVBVOTlKRXlySFdUeXgwYlpQN0FhWV9zQjlBbW9qZEh6M1E?oc=5,"Tue, 26 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Javier Luraschi poses with his new Tesla Cybertruck, which he took delivery of in Seattle last week. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)   “Does it still have that new spaceship smell?”   That was the quip from Dave Boone, walking past the GeekWire office in Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood last week as  Javier Luraschi  pulled up in his new Tesla Cybertruck to take me for a ride.   We may not have launched into space in this version of an Elon Musk vehicle, but Luraschi’s angular, stainless steel monster of an electric truck did launch plenty of stares and double-takes as we drove around the city.   Luraschi is a tech veteran who now heads up  Hal9 , a 3-year-old AI-enhanced data analytics startup that is being incubated at the AI2 Incubator in Seattle.   He’d been waiting more than 3 1/2 years since hitting the “buy” button on the Cybertruck website and putting down a $100 reservation for a truck that was supposed to cost $40,000  when first announced . Now, with a price tag of $100,000, Luraschi had his truck — and all that comes with owning such a head-turner.    “I’ve never had a product where it gets this many reactions from people,” Luraschi said. “I feel like the first reaction is, ‘I don’t like this.’ The next few seconds it’s, ‘Oh, it’s not that bad.’ It’s pretty obvious that people don’t know what to think of it. It’s just many emotions at the same time.”   An introvert’s contradiction   Javier Luraschi behind the wheel of his Tesla Cybertruck. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)   During a 10-minute drive from Fremont out to Golden Gardens Park in Ballard, it was tough to tell who was more distracted — Luraschi as he spotted and tried to react to people staring at his Cybertruck from passing cars, or the people in those passing cars, shooting images or video from the passenger or driver’s seat.   A self-professed introvert, Luraschi was quickly learning that he was driving the wrong vehicle to maintain such a personality. He said he’s not a car guy, he’s a tech guy. But now, he had to be both.   ‘It looks like a weird pixelated car, like something glitched out in the rendering.’ — River Belle   “I don’t like getting stared at,” he says at one point, followed a few moments later by, “I do love the reactions of people.”   Each time we parked the truck to mingle with people who might get a kick out of seeing one in the wild, it was like turning on a bright porch light on a buggy summer evening. But Luraschi was hardly bugged.   “Come on over, guys!” Luraschi said as a couple young people pulled up to get a closer look — and photo — of the Cybertruck.   “I saw you guys driving, I was like, ‘No way! I had not seen one,'” said Conrad Puff-Carter of Seattle, who was cruising around in his 1997 Honda Civic hatchback with River Belle, also of Seattle. “I think it’s cool! I’ve never seen anything like this.”   Puff-Carter immediately asked Luraschi how much he paid, and his wide-eyed reaction to the price was to point at his Civic and say, “You want to know how much I got that for? Zero! The neighbors were moving.”   River Belle, left, and Conrad Puff-Carter pose for a photo taken by Javier Luraschi in front of his new Tesla Cybertruck at Golden Gardens Park in Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)   River Belle of Seattle gives a thumbs up while seated behind the wheel of Javier Luraschi’s Cybertruck. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)   Belle took a little longer to warm up to the steel-grey Cybertruck, with its large black wheels and dramatically shaped front and rear ends.   “It looks like a weird pixelated car, like something glitched out in the rendering,” Belle said. “It sticks out like a sore thumb — in a cool way,” she said as she sat in the truck, before adding, “It’s growing on me.”   Beaming, Luraschi couldn’t help but come across as a Tesla ambassador of sorts, encouraging people to have a closer look and sit inside. He happily posed Puff-Carter and Belle in front of the truck to take their picture.   His desire to know whether people rated it a thumbs up or thumbs down seemed very much in line with his tech career, constantly collecting and analyzing data.   “I love trying new products,” Luraschi said. “To be the first one, it’s at times uncomfortable when people look at you and you’re like, ‘Oh, wow, that’s a lot of attention.’ But, you know, you get to try it first, right?”   Collin Mason got a look at Javier Luraschi’s Cybertruck, but their attention soon turned to Mason’s electric BMW scooter. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)   In another parking lot on our drive, we chatted with Collin Mason, a chef who just moved back to Seattle from New York City. He was headed to band practice when the Cybertruck distracted him.   “The look is so different than anything I’ve seen that I almost don’t like it. But I also like it a lot,” Mason said. “It looks like it came out of a LEGO set or a Batman movie. I’ve never seen somebody go this far with design, as far as really ignoring what’s been done with cars.”   Even with muddy boots on, Mason was offered a seat behind the wheel of the day-old, very clean truck. And Luraschi, whose previous car was an electric Nissan Leaf, was quickly drawn to Mason’s own  BMW CE O4 , a zippy little “urban mobility scooter,” as the two discussed how fast it could go.   ‘Computer on wheels’   GeekWire’s Kurt Schlosser heads off on a Tesla Cyrbertruck ride in Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop)   When Luraschi offered me the chance to drive the Cybertruck, I couldn’t resist. Not because I hadn’t previously driven a newish electric vehicle — such as  Ford’s F-150 Lightning , or  Porsche’s Taycan  — but because I wanted to feel the charge of being stared at by everybody else on the road. And it worked.   Because the vehicle is in the early stages of mass production and delivery, they’re just  not a common sight  on roads right now, especially in Seattle. But there are plenty of videos online  making fun of driving predicaments  or  showing off the truck  from pointy head to pointy toe.   I liked waving at people standing on the sidewalk pointing, or just shrugging my shoulders at people driving by laughing. I could imagine how quickly the photo or video they shot landed in a text thread or got posted on social media — “Finally saw one of these weird things!”   ‘The look is so different than anything I’ve seen that I almost don’t like it. But I also like it a lot.’ — Collin Mason   Driving the Cybertruck didn’t feel much like driving a truck or an electric car. It felt too big and long to be the latter — EVs typically have a more environmentally friendly footprint. And it didn’t really feel like a truck because of how comfortable and futuristic it is — would I really throw a load of lumber and concrete in this thing?   Luraschi himself said he was driving a “computer on wheels” and said he liked the Cybertuck on the unpaved roads where his co-founder brother lives in Monroe, Wash. And he wanted an electric vehicle capable of pulling (don’t tell his wife) the sailboat he wants next.    I loved the acceleration of the truck, like most EVs, and the ability to raise the suspension several inches from sport mode to off road with the push of touchscreen button was definitely cool.    I had trouble figuring out to how get the doors open at first. I couldn’t find my turn signals. The generative braking is a bit tough to get used to. A Seattle pothole felt just as jarring as when I hit one in my Jeep. And during a steady rain, I could only imagine that if the single, giant windshield wiper ever broke or wore out, it would cost an arm and a leg to replace.     VIDEO     It was hard not feel like I was driving a blinking “ELON MADE ME” billboard down the road, more so than I feel about Tesla’s other very ubiquitous models. Luraschi is diplomatic in how he feels about the often polarizing tech personality.   “I do believe that the products that Tesla is creating, or SpaceX, are amazing,” he said. “I don’t believe that Tesla means Elon and SpaceX means Elon. Obviously he’s fundamentally a great force in those companies. But the credit for Cybertruck also goes to the Tesla team. I think he’s a pretty great engineer and product person; we all have our deficiencies and qualities.”   I decided to give the last word to my parents the next morning during a Facetime call, when I told them about my story assignment the previous day. They hadn’t heard of or seen a Cybertruck until I texted them a couple photos.   They taught me how to drive, and they’ve owned probably 40 (gas-powered) cars over the years. As they head toward their mid and later 80s, they’re likely on their last two Honda vehicles.   I asked what they thought of the Cybertruck.   “It looks like a prototype,” my mom said.   I asked my dad if he’d ever want one.   “No.”   (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)"

They're absolutely  everywhere on the road , and they drive  a whole lot of different vehicles . However, sometimes a car is just a bit of an  idiot magnet .  Whether that's fair or not  isn't for me to say, but that's what led us to  last week's question .   We wanted to know  what cars you all thought were only driven by idiots , and oh my God, you all had some answers.  I've been at Jalopnik for a while now , and I've never seen a  QOTD  response like this. Between our website,  Facebook  and  X (it's still Twitter in my heart) , we received over 1,000 answers to this question. Y'all have some  opinions .   We've got plenty of the stuff you'd expect:  lifted trucks , tuned  performance cars  and  Teslas , but there were also plenty of off-the-wall answers I never even thought of. That's where the really good stuff lies.   Anyway, why don't ya start clicking and see which cars your fellow Jalops think are only driven by idiots? Hopefully, yours isn't on the list.         Dodge Charger               Dodge           The Nissan Altima is the obvious answer, but there's another that I've observed in my commute: Dodge Chargers. They're getting up there in years and don't hold value. As a result, they're landing in buy-here pay-here lots and being snatched up by idiots.     I love the Charger. May she rest in peace, but unfortunately, you are correct. They are driven by idiots (and cops).   Submitted by: Midlife Miata Driver         All Teslas               Tesla           I'm really confused as to why Tesla hasn't swept this competition. There are SO many of them on the road, and it's a Model S, it'll have vanity plates.   Yes, WE KNOW it does an acceleration trick. Yes, WE EXPECT you to use it as soon as we move left to pass you.     Anyone with a vanity plate is someone I'd like to never meet in person. This is even more true if your vanity plate alludes to the fact you own an electric vehicle.   Submitted by: tallestdwarf         Tesla Cybertruck, Specifically               Tesla           Not a unique or innovative answer, but it's the Cybertruck.

A few years from now we are going to look at the Tesla Model 3 the same way we look at the Nissan Altima. Book it.

First of all the dam thing is too big, they are driven by short people so they can feel ""safe"", but don't even know the dimensions of their own car to make basic maneuvers, And they are always in the way. For example you're on a 2 lane street coming up to a stop sign with a crosswalk so you get to the stop sign, try to look both ways and here comes this GIANT DUMB THING stopping A. Over the line, and B. stops right next to you so now 50% of your vision is gone and now you hesitate to even go because you can't see if something or someone is coming. And they are always trying to go down small streets, get rid of these things.     Oh, I get it. You hate freedom. Noted.

Submitted by: PDM33         Hyundai Genesis Coupe               Hyundai           Could it be said that the same type of idiot that liked the G35/37 coupe also went for the Hyundai Genesis Coupe? Even John Krafci, the USA Hyundai president and CEO at the time, claimed it was built ""...to deliver a driving experience that challenges cars like the Infiniti G37"". So, are the Genesis Coupe drivers guilty of being idiots by association, or were they the ones smart enough to pick the better sports coupe? Most of the ones I see on the road these days have the same aftermarket boy-racer mods and are generally driven like the Infiniti coupes (hilariously over-aggressive), so maybe when bought new it was the former and as they change ownership hands it begins to devolve into the latter.     Where did all the Genesis Coupes go? They used to be absolutely everywhere. I'm going to assume every last one of them has been crashed into a ditch.   Submitted by: paradsecar         Fart Tunes               BMW           Anything with a crackle/pop tune. The most common offenders by me are BMW 3 series who just endlessly accelerate and slam on the brakes for maximum pop. Good amount of WRXs too. As an old man now, there seems to be a new scene in the WRX world where the ideal is to not have a clean and nice appearing car, but to have mismatched wheels, different color body panels, straight pipes, and a general ratty look to them. And they are consistently driven by the absolute worst people.     Totally fair, tbh.   Submitted by: Kerberos824         Little, High-Performance VWs               Volkswagen           Whenever you see a Audi RS3 or a VW Golf R, you just know it's an egomaniacal 25 year old mobile phone accessories shop employee living with his parents, who is about to mount the pavement to get past you at a junction.

But for article purposes:   Pickups that aren't used to haul things. Especially ones with lifts, wheel spacers, glass packs (or better yet semi-style exhaust stacks in the bed), Calvin pissing on something, testicles hanging from the bumper, or my personal favorite, the one that had most of the above plus a bumper sticker blaming Biden for the price of gas.   Audi A/S3s, BMW 3s. Particularly my neighbor's fucking kid who's 25 and still living at home where he straight-piped his A3 and roars out of the neighborhood every few hours, particularly when the 11-year-old blonde girl across the street is outside, which is both obnoxious and creepy as fuck.   Any modern muscle car.   Anything that might have been on the cover of Sport Compact Car.   Harleys, especially with modified exhausts. If you really had to rev the motor that much at stop lights to keep it running then guess what, your bike's a piece of shit and you should probably put a muffler on it so people don't notice.     Dude, you're my hero. I love hating so much.   Submitted by: iska2000         Lexus????     VIDEO           Any model of Lexus.

Submitted by: BB&J: The poster currently known as BB&J         Subarus               Subaru           I'm going to go with maybe a surprising choice: Subarus. And not even ones that have performance mods. In my area (New England), just the regular old Forrester. You know that series of commercials where it shows multiple families (usually with dad driving) almost dying because of distracted driving, but they are saved at the last minute by a Subaru safety feature? If you have a Forrester where I live, you took those commercials as instructions for driving. You will weave in and out of lanes, not out of aggression, but because staying in between the lines is somehow beyond your driving abilities. You will not notice when lights turn green (or red). You will make left hand turns from the far right lane. You will drive aimlessly and unpredictably through parking lots. You will always double park. I'm starting to think that you have to show proof that your driver's license is actually suspended just to take a test drive.     I appreciate the creativity. WRXs and STIs are so obvious.   Submitted by: preparetosurgetosublightspeed         Ford Mustang     VIDEO           Haven't seen any specific mention of the Mustang yet. Has the Mustang crowd finally grown out of doing burnouts at parking lot exits? Or have they moved on to another car?     I miss Mustang memes. It's been a while since one has popped up for me.

The S10 Blazer, specifically the ZR2 version. Every single owner I have ever met is a dipshit douchebag idiot. Camaro, BMW, Range Rover drivers? They're a mixture, with certain stereotypes applied, but it's not unanimous.   For the S10 ZR2.... if you ever owned one, it's too late for you.     Okay, but seriously: how may S10 Blazer ZR2s have you come in contact with that made you form this opinion? I'm honestly confused.   Submitted by: Maha         Son Of A Bitch               Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik           I would have to say a BMW Z4 (non- real M Coupe version).

Tesla reported 60,365 vehicle shipments from its Giga Shanghai factory in February, according to preliminary data from China’s PCA (Passenger Car Association) via Bloomberg. The February shipments represent a 16% drop from a month ago, a 19% drop from a year ago, and the lowest shipment total since December 2022.   Tesla shares closed down 7.16%, its lowest close since Feb. 13.     Tesla's new Model 3 sedan displayed at the China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, China, Sept. 2, 2023. (Florence Lo/REUTERS)   ·   REUTERS / Reuters   The Chinese Lunar Holiday, during which the country shuts down for nearly two weeks, fell in February of this year. Historically, this has led to depressed economic activity and sales in the country. In addition, Tesla uses earlier months in the quarter to fulfill shipments outside of China and generally ramps up shipments later in the quarter for China domestic sales.   But Tesla’s lowest shipment total in over a year is a concern for the company, which sees China as a huge growth market. Even China’s BYD, which surpassed Tesla in overall EV sales in Q4 and generally dominates the Chinese EV market, saw its February sales tumble to 122,311 units from 193,655, a 37% drop.       China now sells the most EVs in the world, but a recent  slowdown in demand for EVs  has led automakers there to engage in another price war earlier this year — and this includes Tesla.   According to a report from Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner published on Monday, Tesla's latest incentives on the mainland include the “equivalent of ~$4.8K price cut to customers who purchase from existing inventories of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by the end of March.” Rosner said the new incentives include insurance discounts, discounts on paint changes, and preferential financing plans on the Model Y.   The latest incentives come after Tesla  cut prices in January  for the Model 3 and Model Y by 5.9% and 2.8%, respectively.   NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price   •   USD               After hours: 7:59:59 PM EDT     The competition is fierce in China’s EV market, and Tesla having to cut prices and possibly reduce shipments is definitely a concern for investors.   On the flip side, at least the threat from BYD won’t be materializing in Tesla’s US home market, at least right now.   “We’re not planning to come to the US,” Stella Li, executive vice president of BYD and CEO of BYD Americas,  told Yahoo Finance Live . “It’s an interesting market, but it is very complicated,” she added, citing growing political pushback on Chinese companies and the slowing rate of growth for EV adoption.   Concern about BYD entering the US market was growing as the China-based automaker was reportedly going to use Mexico-based factories to import EVs into the US without a tariff penalty under the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."

Can you get electrocuted by an electric vehicle? - Northeastern Global News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPcC1hRlZkbGRtYmtzczlXOXNhTm9OVUhVLU9aX3pYNk9Bd2xtSVRpQ3MwblNicWNnV3d5VjBwd0hyQktfSE1SNWM2TzNKSUxDdGEzMkR1WDZyaFF1YUhBZjJLbG1RamZlZjhGVk16Qy1kdHh4NlJ5Yms2Si0yeG1zWlptTWdBdWN4OXlOSg?oc=5,"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT","It is highly unlikely that a Tesla submerged in a pond in a recent fatal accident in Texas posed a threat of electrocution to its driver or rescuers, a Northeastern University expert says.   Angela Chao, 50, CEO of a shipping company and sister of former transportation secretary Elaine Chao, died in her Tesla last month after her car went into a pond on a Central Texas ranch.   The vehicle went completely under water, according to  according to a report  acquired by the Austin American-Statesman, and it took firefighters about an hour to extract Chao from the car. She was pronounced dead at the scene.   To get into the Tesla, firefighters stood atop the submerged vehicle, according to the report, while trying to break inside the car through its windows. A tow truck was unable to pull the car to the pond’s bank because its chains were not long enough.   Can an electric vehicle submerged in water pose a risk of electrocution?   Were the rescuers in any danger?   Sanjeev Mukerjee , professor of chemistry and chemical biology and affiliated faculty in the department of chemical engineering at Northeastern, says that battery compartments in electric vehicles such as Tesla are completely sealed and well protected.    Northeastern Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Sanjeev Mukerjee says that electric vehicles have a much better battery protection from damage than electric scooters or bikes. Photo by Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University   Most electric vehicles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, like most portable consumer electronics such as smartphones and laptops as well as electric scooters and e-cigarettes are powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries store more energy per unit mass and volume and have a high power-to-weight ratio, high energy efficiency, good high-temperature performance, long life and low self-discharge.   An EV battery, Mukerjee says, may get damaged in an accident or punctured by a sharp object. In that case, the electrodes of the opposite charge might touch each other due to damage, which can start a runway reaction.   The battery would start to overheat due to all the electricity being released at once in the uncontrollable process. The temperature of the battery can quickly reach 900 degrees Celsius, or more than 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, Mukerjee says, and it can catch fire or explode.              More in Science & Technology         When an electric vehicle goes under water, Mukerjee says, the water is unlikely to enter the battery compartment.   “There are codes and standards relating to electric vehicles, which particularly deal with a battery pack and how it is protected and sealed,” he says.   A vehicle manufactured in the U.S. would fully comply with those requirements. In the case of Tesla vehicles, they are equipped with a number of built-in sensors that can shut the battery off in case of a crash or rollover.    “It’s an engineering marvel,” Mukerjee says.    Mukerjee says he is more worried about electric scooters and electric bikes, which also have lithium-ion batteries.They don’t have good battery protection from damage, unlike electric cars.    “If you find little scooters lying outside in the rain,” he says, “I would be concerned about that [more] than I would be concerned about a car.”   If a car falls into a body of water, it would first impact the charging port, he says, which is designed to isolate itself if it shorts. The same would happen to a damaged cable.   “So there are safety guidelines built into Tesla at every point,” Mukerjee says.   First responders still have to know that the submerged car is an electric vehicle, he says, before attempting a rescue. The U.S. Department of Energy provides  resources for the emergency responders  to undergo training on electric vehicle safety and at least some fire academies train their students as well.   “If they properly comply with the safety standards, whether it’s in an accident or a submergence, [they should be safe],” Mukerjee says.   The first thing rescuers need to know, he says, is where the battery pack is and make sure it doesn’t get damaged during the rescue. That may happen if first responders try to lift the vehicle or punch through it with an ax or another tool they may use.   Rescuers should also look out for any high-power busbars — rigid conductors used for connecting together several circuits — that connect parts of the car to its electronic computer.    “They are sealed but if they’re damaged, stay away from them,” Mukerjee says. “Those can give you a bad electric shock.”    The passenger compartment is also isolated from electric shocks and is safe for the driver and passengers.    “Any reasonable electric vehicle [manufacturer] will make sure the passenger is isolated and grounded, because sometimes people are sitting inside the car when the car is being charged,” Mukerjee says.   On land, water is unlikely to cause electrocution from an EV as well. When charging the car at a charging station, the driver should visually check the cable for damage. If the cable is damaged, Mukerjee says, it’s better to not put it in the charging port."

Tesla Autopilot and similar automated driving systems get ‘poor’ rating from prominent safety group - CNN,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPMnBaZTVIeHJ4OHBBUHJBUGpzY0JLcFhOV2dvVDdRenhOcERQZ0F4cnVzVWtyWmFGdEczN0Z0WTFzWXdFcHIxOEZyR2QwOU9XM1lCb2FMUHJLZV95b1VEWXlUb0VNT3FYYzhWWlM0d1l5RXZNTFkwLU9XR0VzS0Q4Q29MOGpETEJYaWFtR0tvT0djOXc1VUHSAYwBQVVfeXFMTmhiUHRXRGtWY0NXdklJWDZhckxtQmdDWDJKMHBRdzFOSEFITXZvZDBrVFBqSjFxMktBWWNLbGN5UXJpT0NkTUhFSUZCS1lnTGNnNDk4Qm9fclFsWV9xZXgzeHo1MThubm9ZUG5TTVU1UVVyZmNJa1ljaGdzQTcxNWZNQmxELXlHakNQUjA?oc=5,"Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT","CNN           —                        The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which rates cars and SUVs for safety, examined so-called advanced driver assistance systems such as Tesla Autopilot and found them wanting.                     These systems combine different sensors and technologies to help a driver keep their vehicle in its lane and avoid hitting other vehicles in front and to the sides. Usually, these systems work only on highways. Some can even allow drivers to remove their hands from the steering wheel but all require drivers to pay attention to the road and vehicles around them at all times.                     Of the 14 systems tested by the agency, 11 earned a “poor” rating including Tesla’s Autopilot and so-called Full Self Driving systems. (Full Self Driving is not actually fully self driving but, unlike Autopilot and almost all other such systems, it is designed to work on city and suburban streets.)                     The organization also rated hands-free highway driving systems from Ford and Nissan as “poor.” General Motors’ hands-free system, Super Cruise, was rated as “marginal.” Only Lexus’s Teammate with Advanced Drive system received a rating of “acceptable.” Even that rating, though, is still one step below the Insurance Institute’s highest possible rating of good.                     “Some drivers may feel that partial automation makes long drives easier, but there is little evidence it makes driving safer,” Insurance Institute president David Harkey said in a statement. “As  many high-profile crashes  have illustrated, it can introduce new risks when systems lack appropriate safeguards.”                     The federal government’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration doesn’t currently regulate these sorts of systems. That’s one reason the IIHS instituted these ratings, Harkey said in an interview with CNN.                     “We felt like this is an appropriate time for us to step into the space, fill this regulatory gap we’re talking about, help drive automakers to produce safer implementations within their vehicles and also help consumers understand what these systems actually are and what the differences are between some of these systems,” Harkey said.                     Many of the systems received demerits for not doing enough to make sure drivers stayed attentive and undistracted as the car steered, braked and accelerated on its own. The Insurance Institute said none of the 14 systems it tested do a good job monitoring driver attention.                     In vehicles where an interior camera monitors driver attention, the Institute tested what happened if that camera is deliberately blocked or if the driver turns their gaze away from the road for too long. Some systems also – or only – monitor whether the driver is holding the steering wheel, so testers looked at what happened if a driver let go of the steering wheel for too long.                     With systems such as GM’s Super Cruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist that allow drivers to remove their hands from the steering for long periods, testers also held a block resembling a cell phone. This tested whether the system could detect the driver’s hands were not ready to grab the steering wheel in an emergency.                     “We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,” Nissan said in a statement emailed to CNN.                     The Institute also checked how these systems alerted an inattentive driver to pay attention. Seven of the systems, it found, didn’t provide two-method alerts – such as a blinking light and a sound or steering wheel vibrations and lights – within 15 seconds of the driver becoming inattentive.                     Insurance Institute test drivers also looked at what would happen if the driver became incapacitated with the automated driving system in use. This is a real concern because the car could just keep driving at high speed with no one actually in control. If a driver doesn’t start paying attention for as long as 35 seconds after having been warned to, the vehicle should begin an emergency slow down and, also, contact emergency services on its own, according to the Insurance Institute. Of the systems tested, only GM’s Super Cruise handled that sort of situation the proper way, according to the Institute.                     Some automakers actually market adaptive driving features the Institute feels are unsafe. For instance, the Tesla and GM systems can perform lane changes entirely on their own without asking whether the driver wants to change lanes. They can be set to do this if another lane seems faster than the one the vehicle is currently in. That’s not safe, Harkey said in an interview with CNN, because it further invites drivers to disengage from driving. Drivers should at least be prompted to allow a lane change even if the car can handle the maneuver on its own, he said.                     “As new vehicles increasingly come equipped with more advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), efforts like the partial automation ratings report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) are important for more robust and unified safeguards,” GM said in a statement emailed to CNN. “We are judicious about safely expanding access to our industry-first hands-free system, Super Cruise, which is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience.”                     Since these ADAS systems are not safety features, it shouldn’t be possible to use them when actual safety features are disabled or not used, the Insurance Institute said. For instance, if seatbelts are unbuckled or if automatic emergency braking is turned off, the systems should be disabled. Only a few of the systems met that criteria, the group said.                     Ford noted that its vehicles have a system that reminds drivers to buckle their seatbelts and that, according to its own data, vehicles using BlueCruise are 10 times less likely to swerve out of their lane, according to a statement from the automaker.                     “We have been working closely with IIHS since BlueCruise was introduced in 2021,” Ford said in an email to CNN. “While we do not agree with IIHS’s findings, we will take their feedback into consideration as we continue to evaluate future updates.”                     The Tesla Autopilot system was tested by the Insurance Institute before a  December, 2023 recall  in which a software update improved driver attention alerts. The Insurance Institute will continue to monitor software updates and improvements and will periodically retest the systems, Harkey said."

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

Please let us know if you have  feedback .                Dive Brief:     Tesla agreed Friday to  settle a years-long racial discrimination lawsuit  filed by a former elevator operator after two separate jury trials ended in the employee’s favor, according to court documents.   The employee, who had been jointly employed by Tesla and two other firms between 2015 and 2016, alleged other employees  directed racist epithets toward him and other Black employees , demeaned him and drew racist caricatures located in various places within the Fremont, California, factory where he worked. After reporting this conduct, the employee claimed he was demoted and, soon after, quit his position.   A jury found that Tesla subjected the employee to a racially hostile work environment in 2021 and  awarded more than $130 million  in damages, which a federal judge  reduced to approximately $15 million  in 2022. The company successfully sought a retrial but lost again, with a new jury awarding the employee  more than $3 million in damages .     Dive Insight:   The suit, removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in 2018, described a work environment at Tesla’s Fremont, California, manufacturing facility as “straight from the Jim Crow era.” In a 2019 legal filing,  Tesla denied the employee’s allegations .   The same plant has been the source of several high-profile allegations against the automaker. In 2023, the  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Tesla , alleging that it had tolerated racial harassment of Black workers at the Fremont facility and retaliated against workers who complained of harassment.   California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing  filed similar claims  against the company in 2022 — also in reference to alleged discrimination at the Fremont plant — and went as far as to allege that Tesla maintained a “racially segregated” workplace.   At present, both the EEOC and the California DFEH suit remain in litigation. In 2022, Tesla published a statement in which it  called the DFEH suit “misguided”  and said it “strongly opposes all forms of discrimination and harassment and has a dedicated Employee Relations team that responds to and investigates all complaints.”"

That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

I will be 84 this year. Except for several corrected orthopedic issues, I’m still healthy, and based on family history, I could last another 10 years until age 94 or longer. By that point my kids will probably take away my smartphone/key, or at least remove the Tesla App from my phone. Even then, my wife, kids, or grandkids will probably be willing to drive me, so we may be using our Tesla even longer than that.   Figure 1: My Tesla Model 3 and ebike at a 98-stall Tesla Supercharger in Baker, California. February 16, 2022. Fritz Hasler photos.   My Tesla Model 3 Long Range was purchased on October 19, 2019, which means that as I write this article today, I have reached the 4 1/2 -year anniversary of owning my Tesla. My odometer now reads 124,337 miles. How can I best ensure that my Model 3 will reach its  14 1/2 -year  anniversary? I will be at ~400,000 miles if I keep driving at my current rate. We commute 3000 miles round trip from our winter home in Northern Utah to our summer home in Northern Wisconsin and back every year. Our Tesla will probably still be making that trip as we get older even if we need to have a child or grandchild do the driving for us. We also commute regularly from Northern Utah to our daughter’s home in Southern Utah in the winter. Therefore, our annual mileage will probably not reduce much as we get older.   In the next 10 years, I would expect to have normal service expenses as we go from ~125,000 to ~400,000 miles on the car. With a simple electric motor and single-speed transmission, my expenses should be much less than the expenses for a car with a complex internal combustion engine, complex automatic transmission, complex exhaust and emissions control system, cooling system, brakes, etc., etc.   However, I don’t want to have to spend ~$15,000 to replace the expensive battery on my EV. We have been instructed by Tesla to not charge the battery above 80% or let it go below 20% if we want maximum battery life. I’ve done this religiously at home. Also, I rarely charge above 80% on cross-country trips because charging above 80% is so slow. Before I leave for a long first leg on a cross-country trip, and rarely when the distance between chargers is above 120 miles, I will charge to 90%. However, I have never charged to 100%. Rarely, on long stretches between Superchargers, I will arrive at 10% or below. Since arriving below 20% state of charge is also stressful on the battery, that should also be part of your calculation about your state of charge when you start a travel leg. My top speed is never over 75 mph. If I see that my estimated state of charge on arrival is less, I reduce my speed.   When my car is charging, if I set the charge limit to 100%, my car will compute the maximum battery mileage range. It now gives me 280 miles. Since the original EPA range for my vehicle was 310 miles, a rough estimate of the state of the battery is 280/310 miles, or ~90%. According to  Battery University , 90% is the optimum end of life for a lithium-ion battery. Am I done? I don’t think so! I have read reports that battery degradation goes slower in later battery years. Also, I purchased the Long-Range version of the Model 3 and I will still have enough range for cross country driving when my battery reaches 50% of its original capacity. However, I will need to ditch the two big aerodynamics-destroying ebikes that I always carry on a tray type carrier on back during long trips.   Am I doing everything I can to prolong the life of my battery?  According to Battery University: The optimum state of charge for lithium-ion batteries is 50%. That means that if your driving distance for a given day is low, you should be operating between 60% and 40%. On a Tesla, it’s easy to set the maximum state of charge. I just reduced mine from 80% to 60%. This should give me plenty of range on days when I have no long trips planned. However, that means that I will need to plan ahead and raise my maximum charge to 80% on days that I expect to drive further. That can usually be done with the app when I wake up on the morning of the day when I need more charge.   Figure 2: L2 charging my Tesla Model 3. April 20, 2024. Fritz Hasler photo.   We’ve all heard that fast charging (Supercharging) your battery is more stressful than trickle charging. However, I’ve seen the results of recent studies that say that supercharging your battery regularly will not shorten its life significantly. Still, according to the Battery University, rapid charging is much more stressful to your battery. I have a L2 charger in my garage in northern Utah. I have NEMA 14-50 outlets with 240V power in my garages in southern Utah and northern Wisconsin. I use the mobile connector charging cable which came with my car in those locations. In all of those locations, I am charging at a rate of ~24 miles/hour or ~6 kW. This ensures that I can recover from a long outing or the last day of a long trip overnight.   However, if my mileage driven on a given day is only 40 miles or less, I could recover that charge overnight at a rate of 4 miles/hour on a 110V trickle charge. Would that increase the life of my battery? I’ve seen some reports that say that would actually decrease the life of the battery. However, that would go against the Battery University guidance. In northern Utah where I have an L2 charger, I could plug my Tesla Mobile Connector into 110 V. I could then use the 220 V L2 charger on long trip days and the Mobile Connector attached to 110V on those short driving days.   Does anyone have data comparing battery degradation at 220V versus 110V? If so, please let me know in the comments section.   What about the case of extended storage (not driving your car for an extended period of time)? According to Battery University, storing your battery at 100% state of charge would be very stressful. If you store your car at 25°C (77°F) you would reduce the capacity of the battery to 80% after one year. However, if you reduce the battery state of charge to 40%, you would only reduce the capacity of the battery to 96% after one year.   Referral Program:  Tesla has reactivated its referral program.

Owner of Tesla Model 3 Performance & BMW X3 M40i compares his two cars - Team-BHP,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOTkhrMlAzdXM3ck53VDJxa3R0VzJKMEtxUmJlNEVza21kVGY1ZVMyYVMzZXM3dmppSHRHVDdVbGNuQjJXRGszX1NEbl96RGVYVmZJR3dEcUV0ek5lbDFodmszeDhMNnh6Zk9uS1p1cmlBa3BCNzlfa3d5N1cyWGdmWkRGcnhFNVFGNUR0VGZNdU5ycmVfcHhJN25kSdIBoAFBVV95cUxPbTRkTnVVRjlBcGlLZDh6Uzg4SXF6LUo3RTRkTWhldUphSXh0RTJ6UGdJRFVrckpXYUV0ZjREblhQS0sxdlpWTXdpX1M4MlB0Rk42YmRURjNqWjROcGZseEN3aXA5cFg4WW9xdmNCR2dTS3JMR19Mc0FGRmdvYmxJRzZRUVZrVlV6eTdFdTROOGROYWUyUWM3dVl1SnUyUHNL?oc=5,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","This EV handles “almost” like a sports car. On the other hand, I have driven larger BMW SUVs like the X5 and X7 and in my opinion, the X3 is a lot more enjoyable.   BHPian mobike008  recently shared this with other enthusiasts. 2023 Tesla Model 3 Performance vs. 2021 BMW X3M40i Thanks to TorroRosso asking this question, “How does the Tesla Model 3 Performance fare compared to my BMW X3 M40i”. Well, it’s not the first time I got this question and surprisingly, I can never provide a straight answer to folks who ask me “Which one of these 2 performance cars is better"" because it’s truly a very difficult answer as both are really fast cars and have many upsides with negligible downsides. I decided to finally put a rest to this quandary and have been collecting my thoughts to see if I can nail down which of these 2 cars is better. I have owned both cars for a reasonably long time to tell the difference between each of them. The final result may be surprising, keep reading and try to put yourself in my shoes and feel free to comment if you own any one (doubt if someone will have the exact same combo at home...haha!) of these amazing machines. Will your final result be different? BMW X3M40i has clocked 34,000 miles (~ 55,000kms) in 3 years and Tesla Model 3 Performance is approaching 16,000 miles (~ 26,000kms) so that’s 80,000kms combined in 3 years with just me as the single driver (not counting the limited driving of my better half). This comparison is most certainly not an apples-to-apples type of comparison but, will have factors like emotional, tangible, placebo effect and not to mention the overall feel playing key roles. Let’s look at the broad categories/parameters that we generally consider when selecting a car (All my car purchases till date have always focused on a single parameter for decision-making- “Performance” because I enjoy driving fast and love a good handling automobile. Other parameters are good to have but, they have never swayed my decision when buying any automobile). Performance Tesla Model 3 Performance This is a drag strip king and will demolish everything that is stock that comes into its path- Be it a BMW M3/M4, Lamborghini or a Ferrari. Its instantaneous acceleration that propels you to 60mph (96kph) from a standstill in 3.1 seconds is an experience not for the faint-hearted. This acceleration is the #1 factor for purchasing this car. It’s simply an other-worldly experience. BMW X3 M40i This car is no slouch. A stock version does 60mph (96kph) in 4 seconds which is ridiculously fast as well. The feeling of how this accelerates is very different from the Tesla. It is loud, has lots of pops and bangs, rattles your internals and brings a thrill to your body that is felt till the bones. On the other hand, Tesla’s acceleration feel like you are sitting in an airplane and being propelled forward in complete silence which is quite eerie but, exhilarating at the same time. Winner Both have exhilarating acceleration but, giving it to Tesla Model 3 Performance purely for reasons of it being faster. Handling Tesla Model 3 Performance Firstly, it’s a compact sedan and secondly, it’s lighter than the BMW so it has 2 primary factors favoring it. Obviously, it handles better than the BMW. Being a performance model, it has stiffer suspension, bigger brakes and can also be used as a RWD or AWD as the bias can be changed by flick of a switch (via. an internal computer). It’s easy to make this change when you want the tail to step out in corners. In short, the Tesla Model 3 handles “almost” like a sports car. With a little bit of modifications to its suspension which I personally feel needs to be tauter (It isn’t even as taut as the X3M40i) and it can be compared with any Porsche in the handling department. BMW X3 M40i Well, it’s a BMW. It feels tight, crisp, and better than good handlers. It’s a Compact SUV, It’s heavier than the Tesla. Despite all these odds, It handles better than 90% of sedans out there. Having driven the larger SUVs in BMW stable like the X5 & X7, in my opinion, the X3 is nimble, changes direction pretty fast and being smaller it is a lot more enjoyable handling experience. It certainly has some body roll (felt especially during the roundabouts near home) but, for 90% of regular road driving including tight cornering in mountains which I have been doing ever since I got this car, it feels absolutely marvelous. Its technology is highly reliable, and its AWD system never made the car miss a step even in horrible conditions (Snow Blizzards, Heavy Rains) in the mountains where I have never curtailed my speeds. In short, it can shame many sedans in the handling department. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance as it’s definitely a better handler than the BMW. Ride, Comfort & Braking Tesla Model 3 Performance Tesla has premium vegan seats (Optional) and they are big, soft, cushy and really comfortable. As I had mentioned before, it was designed with the big “American backside” in mind. It almost feels like sitting on a couch at home as they are that comfortable. Ride on the 20” Uberturbine wheels is comfortable on “Tar” highways but, the moment the car traverses on cemented freeways, road joints, or patchy sections, the ride is not that cushy anymore and you can feel a bit of harshness creep in. However, it’s not really uncomfortable or harsh in any sense, especially on WA road infrastructure. BMW X3 M40i Leather Seats are BMW M spec leather which means it’s harder on touch and feel and also feels premium than the Tesla seats. Overall seat construction is on the harder side & the bucket-styled seats somewhat snug into your thighs (Including the hard pull of seat belts when you start from a standstill) so, it’s not as comfortable as the Tesla. Ride is better than Tesla being on 19” wheels and now with Michelins, it just glides over patchy roads. Washington state road infrastructure is excellent including in the mountains. I was never impressed with Tesla’s braking power. Even though my Tesla has all round discs, bigger pads, bigger calipers etc. being a performance model. On the other hand, BMW brakes which are M-spec brakes are fabulous and have the correct bite and power. Its stopping power is phenomenal. It is a pleasure to use the BMW brakes compared to that on the Tesla. Winner BMW X3M40i as its ride and braking is better. Safety Aids Tesla Model 3 Performance This car is loaded with safety aids. 12 different cameras, Blind Spot Monitoring, Auto Pilot, Auto Steering, Forward Collision Warning, Auto Braking, Sentry Mode and the shebang. BMW X3 M40i Mine is a full spec’d car (meaning with all options) with all safety aids. HUD, Heated Steering Wheel, Cooling Seats, Pedestrian Detection, Blind Spot Monitoring, DSC, ASC, Forward Collision Warning, Auto Braking. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance for the sheer long list of technology & safety aids. Technology Tesla Model 3 Performance Tesla is not a car but, a computer on wheels and is renowned in the industry for best all-round safety and technology features and has been rated as the “safest car” to drive in all important forums. I cannot list the entire list of technology features as it’s just too many. I just have to highlight that you can enjoy YouTube, Netflix, HULU etc. in the car with premium audio that makes you feel that you are not sitting in a car but, an IMAX theatre for it to win this category. Lol! BMW X3 M40i It has all the features that BMW has provided as options, so it’s pretty much loaded from a technology aspect. But it’s still no match for the technology features of a Tesla. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance Space & Comfort Tesla Model 3 Performance This may come as a surprise but, many times family and friends who rode in the car have mentioned to me that there is more space in Tesla than the BMW. Yes, it’s true. It’s an extremely spacious car and has good space at the back for 3 adults for leg and headroom. BMW X3 M40i This car also has decent space for leg and headroom both in front and back and is more than enough for 4 adults. In the back, it’s best enjoyed by 2-adults and fitting a 3rd adult would be a bit challenging and tight. Winner Tesla Model 3 Performance Build Quality Tesla Model 3 Performance Tesla had quality issues in the beginning but, they have improved a lot over the years. Double paned window glass has been added to improve NVH, panel gaps have been reduced considerably, paint quality has improved, and overall quality levels have risen. BMW X3 M40i BMW build quality is several notches above the Tesla inside and out. Everything feels premium and it’s a clear “Winner” for this category. Redlight Acceleration Call me immature or childish. I have this habit of launching at every red light (whenever I am the first car at the red light). As soon as the lights turn green and I hear the chime, A simple dab to the accelerator on the Tesla, it just rockets forward and within a few seconds, I don’t see anybody in my RVM. I accelerate from 0-60mph (speed limit) and probably go up to 70mph. It’s absolutely eerie to see nobody behind me. Lol! Same is the case of BMW, when I accelerate on the greenlight, the drama is much more, and the entertainment factor is several notches above as it’s loud as hell and B58 makes some ridiculously loud pops and bangs and it’s with some kind of childish pleasure I love seeing an empty Rear-View Mirror. Winner I would give this to BMW as it commands more respect than the Tesla on the road. BMW Trivia Whenever I am in a fast lane, I always see the car in front of me give way (move into the slower lane) after they notice the quintessential “BMW Headlights” in their rearview mirror. This happens so often that I tell my wife by instinct that the car in front of us will move. We had a wager on this topic a few times and I won always. That’s the power of the “BMW” and I love it. I always park next to a BMW if I find one and I see that happens with me also so many times when I return to the park"

Alienating Tesla Buyers by the Cybertruck-load - The Big Picture - The Big Picture,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTE5YbnhELVFFVHk5QWtZeEtkajk4Qm1BTDg4X2xyaGV3NFZwWmtHMXVSeHM0Tk5BQWh4NXFTeC1MLUNQd0gtNmNveFlsajZEVFI2dnotT292Y1pHTlJscHRHNVlTdw?oc=5,"Mon, 22 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","@TBPInvictus  here:   Back in  December 2022 , I hypothesized that Elon Musk’s antics and his newfound desire to  own the Libs  were going to destroy Tesla’s appeal to many of his most important buyers .    The latest data confirms those sentiments were on point.   I looked at 2020 voting data and TSLA registrations in counties throughout the state of New York, and theorized as follows:   Watching  Musk’s ongoing antics , it has become very clear to me that his actions are not only destroying Twitter, but the collateral damage is taking Tesla down with it – a veritable twofer of ineptitude and rake-stepping. […]   My thesis is that in Musk’s newfound desire to  own the Libs , he’s alienating the very people who have overwhelmingly been buyers of his EVs.   Consider who the typical Tesla buyer has been over the decade before he began to own the Libs: You would describe them as people who  do not  think global warming is a hoax; they are early adopters, willing to pay more for an EV versus an ICE car. As good as Tesla’s supercharging network is, it’s nowhere near the infrastructure buildout of gasoline vehicles, it can still be inconvenient on 300+ mile trips; although to be fair, ICE infrastructure has had a century head start. These folks want to leave a better world to their kids; they are realists about the dangers presented by climate change, and they think individuals can make a difference via their personal choices. Oh, and they believe in science.   It is not that this group is exclusively Democrats, but draw a Venn diagram with the folks I described above and Dems, and the overlap is significant.   Now comes the Wall St. Journal with the headline:  Elon Musk Lost Democrats on Tesla When He Needed Them Most   The proportion of Democrats buying Tesla vehicles fell by more than 60%, according to car buyers surveyed in October and November by researcher Strategic Vision.    I’m not one who’s typically inclined to take a victory lap, but this one feels like it was so obvious to see coming by bringing together data from very disparate sources and nailed the eventual outcome.   If your politics puts you on the opposite side of the  NYT/Paul Krugman , how do you reconcile that now Murdoch’s WSJ has come to accept this relaity as well…?       BR adds : What makes this so perplexing is what an unforced error this has been. Musk moved the entire auto industry towards electric, he had amassed enormous goodwill and had a built-in customer base that was very loyal. All he had to do was not screw it up, which — apparently — was a bridge too far.   At its peak, TSLA was worth $1.29 trillion; today, it is $448.9 billion:   That is a 65% decrease in market cap + price:         Tesla’s designs are getting old, and looking a little stale. Their huge decade-long software advantage is now probably somewhere in the 2 -4 year range.   Of course, there is much more competition today, as EV buyers have a myriad of choices:  Rivian, Ford, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, VW, Audi, GM, Fiat, Mini, Porsche, Volvo, Nissan, Lotus, Renault, Polestar, Toyota,  and even  Maserati & Rolls Royce  – most of these were not options just 3 years ago.   At least it will make for a fascinating HBS case study in the future…           Source :   Elon Musk Lost Democrats on Tesla When He Needed Them Most  Tim Higgins  WSJ, April 20, 2024   How to Destroy a Brand, Musk Style  Paul Krugman  NYT, Dec. 30, 2022"

Tesla: EV giant cuts prices in major markets as sales fall - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5QNjJ2NEJuWHJmTmZYeGpnUVRXVWVWNC1uWmVmZnB6UjN3d29ZakdlcFdlZHA3UGs3NFFSWHEwTnJfeHMyUzU0SlY5MHFmRmJWN3FCT2l2cmdmZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1SaEx2VWJ6TGdKUUtreHBGODhfNUxrcVRRTGtGRUFDNng5OURhdndoVV92dGF0MDNqQTlWV1NqdmUzcW5xZmZQNXpBM0hhT3JzLURodXc3OXczZnFFZFI0?oc=5,"Sun, 21 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla has cut its prices again in a number of major markets - including the US, China and Germany - as the electric car giant run by multi-billionaire Elon Musk faces falling sales. The move comes after it reported  a sharp fall in its global vehicle deliveries  in the first three months of this year. A price war has been intensifying between electric vehicle (EV) makers, with particularly fierce competition coming from Chinese firms. Tesla is due to report financial results for the first quarter of 2024 after the US market close on Tuesday. In a post on social media platform X , formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said: ""Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with demand."" In China, the firm cut the starting price of the revamped Model 3 in China by 14,000 yuan (£1,562) to 231,900 yuan. Prices of the Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles in the US were reduced by $2,000 (£1,616) on Friday. There were also price cuts in many other countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according Reuters, the news agency. BBC News has contacted Tesla for comment. The company triggered an EV price war over a year ago when it aggressively cut prices at the expense of profit margins. The firm has been slow to refresh its ageing models while rivals in China, such as BYD and Nio, have been rolling out cheaper models. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi also  launched its first EV  last month. Last week, Tesla  announced plans to lay off more than 10% of its global workforce . Over the weekend, Mr Musk said he would postpone  a planned trip to India , where he was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, due to ""very heavy Tesla obligations"". On Friday, the firm recalled thousands of its new Cybertrucks over safety concerns. It is because their accelerator pedals currently risk getting trapped by the interior trim, increasing the possibility of crashes. Tesla's shares have fallen by more than 40% since the start of this year."
The Complicated Reality of EV Road Trips - AFAR,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNTkVxaTZ4ejRxakxOZklXVm0zcHNPWklYbnI4WEtiSVRZSTkySXpSaTlTdUV6clQ0Yy00ejQwMENMX1RQMzJtUHBNam1nc1VtV3VSUVI4NG45UnBIT0NleUpoSzlnUlE4eXNCdm9oMjhqLTNZR3ZhYzBjRTAwbDZwVkU5bEduTFA5T09aY0VPdw?oc=5,"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","The trip started in thrilling fashion, with my husband and I discovering our Tesla 3—delivered to our curb via  rental car company Kyte —had a setting akin to “ludicrous speed”. We didn’t realize we were in ludicrous speed until we went from zero to 40 mph on a one-way residential street in Brooklyn in seconds, braking abruptly  way  before the stoplight. Not because I hit the brakes—just because I took my foot off the accelerator. This tale may sound familiar to first-time users of an electric vehicle (EV), be it a Tesla (ours was the standard model) or an  everyday battery-powered stallion . My husband and I received an introduction to EV road trips two summers ago on a weekend getaway from  New York City  to  Montreal  meant to recharge our batteries in more ways than one. We thought we were  so  clever. We estimated we would save on gas (it cost $28 to go 280 miles then) and didn’t even choose our first pit stop—our friendly robot car, heretofore known as “Kit,” would map the route for us. But there are a lot of habits to unlearn after decades of pulling up to gas stations, navigating via dialed dashboards, and using brake pedals to, you know, brake. Here are a few realities every EV road-tripper should anticipate as they embark on this next generation of car travel.       EVs embrace technology with features like phone apps and touchscreens. Photos Courtesy of Laura Dannen Redman       Driving an electric vehicle requires some practice Humble thyself when driving an EV for the first time. It’s not quite as bad as learning stick shift but some things are just . . . different. Many EV brands open with a key card or a phone app, which means you can open the car remotely or cool it off before you get in. And consider the role the “go” pedal plays: Taking a foot off the accelerator activates regenerative braking, which means the car slows and feeds power back to the battery. I barely touched the brake and had to get the feel of decelerating. Meanwhile, standard acceleration for a Tesla 3—what I thought was ludicrous—is zero to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, aka fast enough to fling passengers against their seats and make anyone riding in the back feel like abandoning ship. Until I discovered “chill mode,” which limits acceleration, there was a lot of unintentional flinging.   The absence of a traditional dashboard—with its speedometer and gas gauge, circles and lines and arrows and numbers—can also feel unnerving. In its place is a 15-inch touchscreen that does all the necessary monitoring (battery duration, GPS, tire pressure) and entertaining (Apple Music, arcade games, “caraoke,” even a virtual fireplace and, to my kids’ delight, whoopie cushion sounds). Keeping one eye on the road and one on the touchscreen, horizontal to the driver’s eyeline, felt spasmodic. It helped to have a copilot navigate the touchscreen, especially when it came to looking for a charging station. EV trips differ depending on location We had a 375-mile drive ahead of us, which would normally take about six hours. In a gas car, we would stop halfway in  Saratoga Springs , home to the famed race track and excellent chipotle beef chili at the  Olde Bryan Inn.  In a Tesla, we could go 300 miles on a single charge . . . though when the car was dropped off by Kyte, we had about 130 miles of battery life. (Note: We couldn’t just plug the car in at the house—only a DCFC, or direct current fast charger, can fill the battery in 20–30 minutes. Without that, it could take 40–50 hours, or more, to get a full charge on 120 volts.) Kit the Robot Car had all the Tesla DCFC “Superchargers” programmed into its navigation, so it showed us the most strategic spot to “refuel”: New Paltz, 83 miles or an hour and a half away. Thankfully, this stop was next to a diner. As of today, the state of New York has 84  Tesla Superchargers , with more being added every year as the United States continues to invest in EV infrastructure. (Look at President  Biden’s Build Back Better infrastructure plan  for how broadly this extends: The goal is to have 500,000 public chargers nationally by 2030.) Yet in 2023, five states accounted for nearly half of the nation’s 64,187 charging stations, according to  Consumer Affairs.  (California holds 25.5 percent; New York comes in second with 6.1 percent, followed by Florida, Texas, and Massachusetts.) In the past, Tesla Superchargers could only be used by Tesla drivers, a company-man mark of ego that was eliminated in late 2021, when Tesla opened its network of Superchargers to non-Tesla EVs. There are currently  Level 1 and Level 2 chargers across the USA , charging EVs in 4–10 hours (or days), as well as more DCFCs of the non-Tesla variety. The website and app  ChargeFinder  come in handy for tracking down all kinds of plugs.         Your charging experience can vary depending on the charging station’s location Photo Courtesy of Laura Dannen Redman       Embrace the roadside rest station When it comes to an EV road trip, mapping a route in advance is a  little  futile. Plans will likely be dashed when Tesla’s “red alert” comes on to recharge; the car  really  wants you to plug in around a quarter-battery. Much like a gas station, there are about 6–8 plugs (instead of pumps) at a Supercharger, and they’re sometimes all taken. However, unlike a gas station, cars don’t pull in and out in a handful of minutes. It’s hard to know how much time a car has left to charge without peering into a car’s front dash like a creeper. Despite our best efforts to anticipate when we would need to charge next—and what Kit would suggest—we ended up pulling off at multiple exits to find a charger with an element of charm or convenience. We made the best out of an unexpected 30-minute pit stop with freshly scooped ice cream at the gas station in who-knows-where New York. If the next way station was in a Target parking lot? Jackpot. Was it worth it? On a great road trip, the detours turn the journey into something as memorable as the destination. And there were definitely thrills, like the time spent with the car on autopilot, and moments of delight and serendipity. But by the time we pulled into the parking lot of Montreal’s  Fairmont the Queen Elizabeth , we had been on the road for seven and a half hours, in need of a break and a beer.    The detours of the Great American (EV) Road Trip were emotionally draining, but also served big lessons—namely in slow travel and letting go of control."
"Tesla Profits Dip But Carbon Credits Revenue Up, 38% of Net Income - CarbonCredits.com",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQWmhzVVljT1pTRnJNWWFLNS1ydllTNUt5TllOUEVJVDZ2VUl5ako4ZllULUI4RU9zaVo3UU9LWUdHT1d0WldQQk1Zc3NwaWFlVkxkUkx5VC12emhZNGJNOGotRkcyVE9Sa1FrVDZvTzdCN1FweHk4b0ptT0pRV2ZLTmdPaTJULVNRUndteWdoRk1rbGVjRnc?oc=5,"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Elon Musk’s Tesla continues to capitalize on the need of its competitors to comply with emissions standards, a business model that has proven highly profitable for the electric vehicle (EV) company. As the EV giant incurs minimal costs to earn these carbon credits, the revenue from their sale translates to pure profit.   While the specific recipients of these credits remain undisclosed, this revenue stream has been vital for Tesla’s financial success.    Tesla’s Green Cash Flow: Profiting from Emissions Compliance     In its recent  first-quarter 2024 filings , the company reported a $442 million income from the sale of carbon credits (automotive regulatory credits). This figure represents a slight 2% increase from the previous quarter of Q4 2023, which is $433 million.      Remarkably, this credit revenue accounts for a whopping 38.6% of the company’s Q1 2024 net income ($1,144 million).      However, Tesla’s profits took a significant hit in the first quarter, falling 55% to $1.13 billion compared to a year ago. This decline was attributed to a prolonged strategy of cutting EV prices and various unforeseen challenges that impacted the company’s financial performance.   Despite reporting revenue of $21.3 billion in Q1 2024, representing a 9% drop from the previous year, Tesla’s earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations. Operating income also decreased by 54% to $1.2 billion compared to the same period last year.   The gradual ramp-up of the updated Model 3 production at the Fremont factory in California contributed to the difficulties. The company also noted that global EV sales faced pressure as many automakers prioritized hybrids over electric vehicles.   In a report by S&P Global Commodity Insights, automakers are increasingly embracing plug-in hybrid EVs as a more affordable short-term solution on their journey toward full electrification.    In China, the share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) within the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market declined by 10% points to 57.0% in February compared to the same period last year. This trend of declining BEV share is also observed in the United States and Germany. Both the U.S. and the European Union (EU) are adapting their PEV targets based on feedback from the industry.   Behind the dipping financial results, Tesla managed to generate more revenue from its regulatory credits. And the hybrid approach of other carmakers means they have to purchase carbon credits from the EV giant. The  price for the carbon credit  remains discreet between Tesla and the buyers.    Since the company started selling carbon credits to its peers, this revenue stream has become a billion-dollar bonanza for Tesla. Last year, the automaker generated a total annual income from carbon credits amounting to  $1.79 billion . That’s a record high so far for the company’s automotive regulatory credit revenue.     Beyond Cars: Tesla’s Surge in Energy Storage Deployment   While automotive revenues experienced a decline, Tesla saw growth in other segments of its business, particularly in energy storage, which is becoming increasingly profitable for the company. As Megapack installations continue to increase and fleet expands, Tesla anticipates consistent profit growth in this segment.           In Q1 2024, energy storage deployments reached a record high of 4.1 GWh. Additionally, revenue and gross profit from Energy Generation and Storage reached all-time highs.    Compared to the same period last year, revenues were up 7% to $1.6 billion, and gross profit surged by 140%. This growth was primarily driven by increased Megapack deployments, although there was a slight decrease in solar installations. Energy Generation and Storage remains Tesla’s highest margin business.   In addition, Tesla generated $2.28 billion in revenue from services, which includes income from its Supercharger network. This revenue stream is expected to grow further as more automakers, such as Ford, GM,  Rivian , and VW, adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard technology.   Tesla’s Carbon Credit Surprises and Future Innovations   Despite previous expectations that  carbon credit income  would decline as competitors ramped up electric vehicle (EV) production, Tesla has been surprised by sustained revenue in this area.   In 2020, the company’s former CFO Zachary Kirkhorn anticipated a decrease in the significance of this revenue stream over time. However, contrary to these predictions, Tesla’s earnings from regulatory carbon credits have not experienced a significant decline. In fact, last year’s earnings slightly exceeded the income from the previous year.   Despite the profit dip, Tesla used its earnings report to highlight its future initiatives. Notably, it emphasizes focus on advancements in autonomy through  AI  and the introduction of new products built on a next-generation vehicle platform. The company significantly increased its research and development spending, allocating $1.1 billion in the first quarter, a 49% rise from the same period in 2023.   Elon Musk underscored the company’s commitment to investing in the future, despite current challenges. Tesla aims to expedite the development of a new vehicle lineup, with production anticipated to begin in early 2025.    Musk emphasized that these new vehicles, including more affordable models, will leverage aspects of both the next-generation platform and the existing ones. This enables for production on the same manufacturing lines as the current vehicle lineup.   Tesla’s Q1 results, though showing a decline in profits, sparked a surge in share prices, rising by as much as 12% following the announcement. Investors seemed more interested in Tesla’s forward-looking statements regarding future products, particularly introduction of cheaper vehicles by 2025.   Musk emphasized during the earnings call that while some automakers are shifting towards plug-in hybrids, Tesla believes that battery  electric vehicles  will ultimately dominate the market. And their strategy remains focused on EVs despite the challenges faced in the industry."
Tesla stock has plummeted this year. Will the company recover? - ABC News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRnkwY21KNkd0S0xCM0xHblpVZUo4VVFseDRNMWgybDdGTmJmcVJBS1h5bVdfSzd5MEJSc3hwVmRYbVBDZkliTlJ1bUg0ZldjbkRlS2FpT3l3WUV4RVk4SmdOQThFME1KdWJBVnktN0RmVVdNMVBvQXBkeVhaSEVfMDJEd3NFaEItS0RJalVvNjdocmZxNDBpRNIBngFBVV95cUxQOHZfNXY1akp3c1V6QkhXdGtXYnNzcnFBMDIyOFZzbHRhQ2hFVEU3VEk2OVk5eDhJbUpmQzJyd0RkUkM5Q1hLYjltMFp1ai1tZ1hyMzZPWExqS2xya2xLdmlnSzRxTHlTeDBOZ29lZ05OeFprMGNoald2UDNJTU9keS1JQ2htNmlHQlU2VWpwdHZJOVphdmYyTGxRNlBQQQ?oc=5,"Tue, 09 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla , the  Elon Musk -led electric vehicle company, appears desperate for a tune-up. The company’s share price has plummeted more than 25% so far this year, making it one of the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Over the same period, that index has risen about 10%. Shrinking car sales, major setbacks in autonomous driving and increased competition have cost the company more than $200 billion in lost market value in less than four months. Analysts who spoke to ABC News differed on whether the company would ever recover those losses. Critics say demand for the company’s cars has slowed as a result of its failure to release a new, affordable model, as well as a chill in the overall EV market. As competitors roll out alternatives, Tesla faces a difficult path to regain its previous breakneck growth. Proponents, however, point to the company’s record of industry-leading innovation, suggesting the breakthroughs that fueled its sprint ahead of the competition could reemerge as it readies for new EV models and perfects its autonomous driving software. “Tesla has been here before but this is a code red,” Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, a longtime Tesla bull, told ABC News. Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Last week, Tesla reported a significant decline in car sales over the first three months of 2024. The company delivered 387,000 cars over that period, marking a 20% decline from the previous quarter and an 8% decline year-over-year, an  earnings report  showed. The results fell well short of Wall Street expectations. In a  statement  that day, the company attributed the sluggish performance to preparation for production of a forthcoming version of its Model 3, as well as shipping delays in the Red Sea and an alleged arson attack at its Berlin factory. Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, said consumer demand for the company’s cars has fallen sharply from the heights attained during the pandemic. At that time, a major shortage in the worldwide supply of auto parts ultimately benefited Tesla since the company streamlined production and outperformed hamstrung competitors, Johnson said. “Tesla had cars available when the auto industry writ large globally did not,” Johnson told ABC News. Once supply blockages eased, competitors ramped up production and rolled out new EV models. The glut of alternative options has coincided with a  slowdown  of overall consumer demand for EVs, Johnson said. “Tesla has more capacity than there is demand for its cars,” Johnson added. “That’s the reason why it’s struggling.” Elon Musk hands over a Model Y car to a customer during the opening ceremony of the new Tesla Gigafactory for electric cars in Gruenheide, Germany, March 22, 2022. Patrick Pleul/Pool via Reuters, FILE Over the past year, Tesla has  discounted  some of its models in an effort to goose up demand. Analysts who spoke to ABC News said Tesla would need to release a newer, low-cost model as a means of attracting thrifty spenders. According to a  Reuters  report last week, however, the company dropped plans for a low-cost model to be priced at about $25,000. Musk refuted the report in a  post  on X hours after the story was published. “They need a sub-$30,000 vehicle sooner rather than later,” Ives said. Boosters of the company’s potential for long-term growth point to its autonomous driving software, but that product has faced challenges of its own. In December, Tesla  recalled  about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system. Two months later, the company  recalled  about 360,000 more cars over crash risks tied to its self-driving system. In response to a letter from members of Congress calling for an investigation of the self-driving system, Tesla senior director of public policy, Rohan Patel, said last March: ""Tesla's Autopilot and FSD Capability features enhance the ability of our cusotmes [sic] to drive safer than the average driver in the U.S."" The response was first reported by  Reuters . Looking ahead, analysts said Tesla retains a path to recovery but it remains unclear whether the firm can achieve it. “In order for the stock to appreciate, we need sales to reaccelerate and for the full self-driving to start seeing greater adoption,” Craig Irwin, a senior research analyst at Roth MKM, told ABC News. “Call me a skeptic.” Gordon said he expects the company’s outlook to worsen, since declining sales revenue and persistent costs could force the company to fill a potential budget gap with an injection of outside funds. “That will scare the bejesus out of Tesla bulls,” Johnson said. For Ives, the current crisis at Tesla marks an opportunity for the company to innovate and recapture its previous era of remarkable growth. “I believe they can get through it, but this is a white-knuckle period,” Ives said."

Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty Images                               Tesla is recalling the new Cybertruck to fix a defective pedal pad that could cause accelerator pedals to get stuck in the depressed position, raising the risk of a crash.    Specifically, when someone stomps on the accelerator, the pad can come off and get trapped in a bit of trim.    That would leave the accelerator stuck in the ""on"" position — something that has happened at least twice. When a driver hits the brake pedal, the truck will stop even if the accelerator is depressed. No injuries or crashes have been reported.    The problem, as Tesla reported to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, originated on production lines with soap.    ""An unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly,"" the  report  says.    Evidently, workers used soap to help get the pad into place on the pedal.  Traces of that slippery soap remained, hence the problem.    The recall involves all 3,878 of the aesthetically-divisive angular trucks that have been sold so far. While some Tesla recalls are for software fixes that can be issued over-the-air, meaning a vehicle downloads an update without a trip to a mechanic, this one is a physical defect. It requires a physical repair.    This is the second soap-related manufacturing process to make headlines this month. A Boeing supplier recently  defended  the use of Dawn dish soap as lubricant in assembling door seals in manufacturing jets like the one that lost a door mid-flight.    Meanwhile, the Tesla Cybertruck, a vehicle with an extremely unusual manufacturing process, has also faced complaints since its launch about problems with  rust  and  potentially finger-pinching trunks.   Tesla, the company that shook up the auto industry by profitably making mass electric vehicles, has warned investors it's ""between"" periods of growth. After poor sales last quarter and layoffs of more than 10% of global staff, executives will talk to investors on a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings call next week."

Tesla layoffs shake confidence in the EV-charging future - E&E News by POLITICO,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPYi1qZk5Nc0dEaHY1cWdoMXh0WC1nM2dRVXVkNmtLUVpBZThkNEpzM3p2YTZBQ1daSFN1Wk5yMTlyWEFVLUF0LThUeFZFLWZfczR1QkwtbjIyNHp4eTNrOHhkMHhGNW9NbmhDX3RBVUtkVVRacU9JQVJ5VnhfeDhXdy1VRXBWZFZtb0hoRTFRQW44VTQ?oc=5,"Wed, 01 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","For the last dozen years, as the prospects for America’s electric vehicles have veered between optimism and doom, industry insiders could always count on one rock-solid, reliable thing: Tesla’s charging network.   Late Monday, that all changed.   In a single stroke, CEO Elon Musk called his company’s vaunted charging reliability into question when he laid off most or all of Tesla’s Supercharger team, the people who made Tesla the envy of the EV industry. The network they built is bigger, faster, smarter and more reliable than any other company’s — and has become the linchpin of the auto industry’s plan to persuade millions of Americans to buy EVs and turn the tide on climate change.   “It feels like the rug just got pulled out from under a lot of the industry alignment that has been built in the last 12 months,” said Matt Teske, an industry veteran and CEO of Chargeway, an EV-charging software platform. “And leaves us on shaky ground.”   The abrupt decision left the ever-widening ecosystem of people who rely on Tesla — drivers, automakers, suppliers, electric utilities and policymakers — suddenly in the lurch, as emails to longtime Tesla contacts bounced and the most respected team in the industry all but ceased to exist.   This targeted layoff is Musk’s latest response to a sharp downturn in Tesla’s prospects as its cars become less popular. Last week, while reporting lower earnings, Musk said that the automaker would shed more than 10 percent of its global workforce of 140,000.   “We need to be absolutely hardcore about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk said in an email to Tesla staff on Monday, reported first by  The Information . While past rounds of layoffs have been spread among divisions, this one lopped off hundreds of people on the EV charging team, including Rebecca Tinucci, the unit’s head.   Suddenly, a lot of things that seemed beyond question are being nervously asked.   “What’s the plan, what’s the strategy, and at such a pivotal moment, why are they bailing on that entire team?” asked Jonathan Katz, an EV-charging executive who was part of Tesla’s charging unit for five years ending in 2020.   Will Tesla drivers — and now other EV drivers — be able to continue to rely on the network that was one of the main perks about buying a Tesla? Will the automakers who bet their future EVs on Tesla’s charging stations and technology still have a reliable partner? Will Tesla be there to guide an industrywide transition to the technology that it invented? And will Tesla continue to participate in the federal build-out of charging stations — an effort that, until this week,  it was leading ?   Musk on Tuesday addressed the uncertainty in a  post on X , the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and that Musk now owns, saying: “Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.”   The news, while startling, struck some as a canny move — perhaps one that reflects the maturing EV sector, where more players are coming onto the scene and can take over the charging tasks that Tesla has, until now, managed mostly by itself.   Musk “clearly looked at what needs to be done to build out the Supercharging network, and it is probably a lot less than what it took to design and plan it,” said Karl Brauer, an auto analyst for the car-sales website iSeeCars.com.   However, some questioned how Tesla will carry out a slower expansion — or any operations at all — if the team behind it is no longer there. No one contacted for this story could name a single source in Tesla’s charging sector that still works there.   One of those trying to reach Tesla’s team Tuesday was Andres Pinter, the co-CEO of Bullet EV Charging Solutions, a company that provides electricians and other workers to build charging stations. Tesla Supercharger stations account for a quarter of its work.   The company’s chief operating officer, Mark Vogel, “was driving to a job in Dallas this morning when he received a call from our Tesla construction lead saying that his entire team was laid off,” Pinter wrote in a Tuesday email. “I have gotten email bounces from at least 20 Tesla contacts.”   “It’s unclear to me who, if anyone, is still at Tesla who has anything to do with charging,” he added in a phone interview.   Tesla’s bedrock role   Tesla’s sudden reversal matters because of the constancy of its charging network. Sophisticated, widespread and functioning as planned, it earned a unique and foundational role in the world of American electric vehicles.   When Tesla founded the Supercharger network 12 years ago, it realized earlier than others that a widespread and reliable web of changing stations was key to ensuring drivers would make the jump to electric cars.   The system grew out as a web of so-called Destination chargers — slow chargers located at overnight locations like hotels — and Superchargers, an exclusive perk meant for Tesla drivers to quickly fill batteries on the go. The charging system was designed to be tightly bound to the car itself, so drivers could set in a destination and get real-time instructions on where to charge and for how long.   Tesla reported last week in a financial filing that it has built  more than 6,200 Supercharger plazas , far more than any other company. Even as layoffs began, the team was unveiling numerous new locations, from  San Diego to Taiwan .   “They had become such a well-oiled machine,” said Teske.   To carry out that feat, Tesla’s Supercharger team mastered a host of behind-the-scenes skills that it did better than anyone else: pinpointing the highway interchanges where a refill is most needed, coordinating with the electric utility to learn where the power supply was strongest and persuading restaurants and malls to trust Tesla’s promise that building rows of Superchargers in their parking lots would bring new foot traffic and customers.   Along the way, the company also became an expert contributor in the policy arena.   Any time a state legislature, agency or public utility commission considered a change in the rules to govern the new arena of EV charging — or offered money to build out a network — Tesla would usually submit comments. With far more experience than any other company, their briefs carried an authority that others didn’t.   Tesla’s charging team worked hand in hand with the company’s public policy team, which has also been disbanded. The head of public policy, Rohan Patel, stepped down last week.   “This nexus of the Supercharger team along with the public policy team, they worked really well together to get where we are,” Teske said.   In 2022, as traditional automakers finally started delivering a substantial number of EVs to the roadways, they ran into a problem. Their drivers couldn’t use Tesla’s chargers, because they were meant only for Teslas. And the public networks had an  array of reliability problems .   Ford was the first automaker to hit on the solution. Last spring, it struck a deal with Tesla to use its 12,000 U.S. charging stations and committed to building Tesla’s charging technology called the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, into its future vehicles.   Other automakers followed suit in short order. By February, Tesla’s NACS had become the industry standard, with virtually every automaker planning to redesign their charging systems to meet Tesla’s specifications.   Tesla’s charging prominence became such that it challenged the Biden administration’s plans and redefined federal policy.   The bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress in 2021, allocated $7.5 billion for a charging network. Its early rules called for those stations to be built using the public standard at the time, called the Combined Charging System.    But when automakers piled into Tesla’s camp, the Biden administration was forced to scramble,  opening its rules to changes  so stations would qualify if they offered both systems.    ‘A lot of questions’   With Tesla’s charging expertise now disbanded, the players who relied on it face uncertain circumstances.   One example is state departments of transportation, which are now in the process of determining what companies will win awards to build charging stations under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The $5 billion, five-year arm of the bipartisan infrastructure law aims to build a backbone of charging stations along highways.   Tesla, already a winner of roughly 14 percent of these awards, is poised to pick up more in states that have announced tentative winners.   But with Tesla removing itself from the market, “your decision is more complicated all the sudden,” said Loren McDonald, the founder of EVAdoption, an EV-charging data platform that tracks NEVI. With Tesla newly bereft of staff, she said, “What do you do?”   Even more consequential choices might face automakers, which are planning to install Tesla’s NACS technology in their cars starting next year.   In theory, Tesla’s competitors can operate the new charging platform without Tesla’s help. But in practice, Tesla is —or was — the one with the most expertise, and without it, the new EV charging systems could be less reliable.   “It leaves a lot of questions: Are these automakers still going to get the level of support they were promised?” asked Katz, the former Tesla charging employee.   Automakers, for their part, said their plans to move to Tesla’s NACS are still underway.   A spokesperson for Ford, Martin Günsberg, said, “plans for our customers do not change.” A spokesperson for General Motors, Darryll Harrison, echoed that sentiment and added, “we are continuing to monitor the situation.”   Whatever the consequences, the startling speed of the turnaround shows that EV charging — once the steadiest part of Tesla’s business — is now starting to look like another area subject to Musk’s hair-trigger impulses.   “It was urgent accelerati"
"Why Elon Musk Would Kill Tesla’s $25,000 Model 2 - The Autopian",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE0tb2NUUTJodDdzcVVjV1dYckNtcjN1dHRMWWI3RDZjUENyZzM3M0YyeTMzdnc4b2JjRWRpUkNjNG82TVZpMVM4TzNON3RyOGRVbkZDcWxhYlRfRExtbThObEZab3FoQzJlY1JWRm9RdkFaUjVIY2EtTWRnVVNSYUU?oc=5,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Every day I try to thank God for the many blessings he’s given me, specifically my wonderful family and friends. Pretty high up there on the list of things I’m grateful for is that I am not the CEO of a car company. It’s a tough job and I probably love cars too much to be responsible for making decisions at a publically traded automobile-producing entity. It’s much easier to just second-guess their decisions and then borrow their cars.   I say this because I’ve got to talk about Elon Musk due to this  this  Reuters  report  that says Tesla killed its affordable car program. You know, the one that CEO Elon Musk  said would happen in three years way  back in 2020, would be mostly autonomous and would cost under $25,000? Remember that?     The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   Obviously, that didn’t happen and, instead, it seems like a lot of Tesla’s talent has gone into making the Cybertruck. As recently as earlier this year Musk was talking about the cheap car, so the  Reuters  report is an interesting surprise. Here’s the key part of the article:     Two sources said they learned of Tesla’s decision to scrap the Model 2 in a meeting attended by scores of employees, with one of them saying the gathering happened in late February.     “Elon’s directive is to go all in on robotaxi,” that person said.     The third source confirmed the cancellation and said new plans call for robotaxis to be produced, but in much lower volumes than had been projected for the Model 2.     As the report also notes, this was long a dream of Elon Musk. He was supposed to sell expensive EVs to part of the market to fund the development of a cheaper EV for everyone else, thus making Tesla the biggest carmaker in the world.     Musk has responded to the story  by saying  Reuters  is lying  without denying any specific part of the story, which makes this more interesting. I don’t think  Reuters  is lying and it would be weird for a bunch of sources to suddenly lie to them. It’s possible there’s some confusion or misinterpretation here. I don’t know, but there a few reasons why Tesla might at least delay the $25,000 car and they range from the reasonable to the insane.   The Sensible Reason Why Musk Might Kill The $25,000 Car     There aren’t big margins in $25,000 cars. Cheap cars are a good way to earn customers and a bad way to make a lot of money. We all love the cheap Ford Maverick Hybrid XL, but the profits are razor-thin on a product like that. While cheap EVs are the way forward for increasing EV market share, it may not be the best way forward for Tesla.   If the dream was a cheap, nice EV, well… the  BYD Seagull is $10k in China  and about $20k everywhere else. As Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in response to the story:   “… [O]ne could argue that there are enough strong players in China (with enough unused capacity) to have already accomplished this objective. What more could Tesla bring? Assuming the Model 2 was the ‘best EV’ money could buy for under $25k… how long would it take before Chinese rivals caught up? A couple years?   It’s a fair point! Mission accomplished. Focus on finishing the Roadster, updating the Model Y, and introducing cars that might actually make money. Ford is  already pushing ahead with ex-Tesla folks to build its cheap car , so even with trade barriers to China, the company might end up in a situation where Tesla has real competition.   The Sad Reason Why Musk Might Kill The $25,000 Car   Source: Tesla   Given the known timing of when Musk was hoping to deliver the Model 2, is it possible that Musk shifted too many resources to build the Cybertruck? The  Reuters  article makes a reference to it:   If Tesla had moved forward with the low-cost car, it wouldn’t have arrived on the market until the latter half of 2025, by the company’s estimate. But the entry-level EV segment is already crowded with compelling models from BYD and many other Chinese brands.   Tesla is late to the segment in part because of a pivotal decision by Musk. In 2020, after releasing its hit crossover, the Model Y, Tesla focused on the highly experimental Cybertruck instead of an affordable car.   Musk unveiled a prototype of the angular, stainless steel-clad truck in 2019 and predicted a starting price of about $40,000. The vehicle finally arrived last year, but the lowest price version of the truck won’t be available until 2025, at a price of about $61,000.   The timing does make sense. It doesn’t mean that the car has to be dead, but similar to the reasoning above, maybe Musk is too late and it’s better to do something else.   The Kinda Insane Reason Why Musk Might Kill The $25,000 Car     At some point, there will be more self-driving cars. The tech will get close enough that enough of us will be comfortable with it. Regulators will slowly, begrudgingly create a framework to make it work. I don’t think it’ll be tomorrow. I don’t think it’ll be five years from now. Just… eventually.   There’s another hint in the piece above that what Musk thinks is that he’s so close to self-driving being a thing, and that it’s the thing that makes the company super valuable, that he’s going to just chuck the cheap car part of the platform and focus fully on robotaxis (Ford is, for its part, also going to make its sub-25k the base for a robotaxi).   Tesla’s timeline and business model for robotaxis remain unclear. Musk has publicly predicted a future of mobility in which driverless taxis could eventually become a more common mode of transport than human-driven cars. He has said Tesla, the world’s most valuable automaker, would be “worth basically zero” without achieving full self-driving capability.   It’s possible Musk’s team had a huge breakthrough we don’t know about and it’ll all be here soon and Musk will be the smart one, again. Tesla-watcher/investor Sawyer Merritt has a theory along these lines, that the cheap car isn’t canceled, just that the robotaxi part of it is taking precedence:     Musk responded to the above tweet with the big eyes emoji, so maybe?   The Truly Insane Reason Why Musk Might Kill The $25,000 Car   What if Tesla’s business isn’t really cars? I know this is a wild statement since that’s a big chunk of the company’s value, but Musk is out there working on AI and robots and flamethrowers and tunnels. There are fundamental limitations to the amount of money to be made in the car business and it’s possible that Musk would rather pivot to the next thing rather than focus on the arduous, slow, and kind of boring work of making cars now that he’s got to compete with BYD, and. Xiaomi and a bunch of other companies.     Jonas, the analyst mentioned above, references this in his note:     “While we do not expect Tesla to ‘exit’ the auto business any time soon, we do believe the company’s scientific endeavors can and will, over time, expand far beyond the automotive paradigm. Perhaps the unexpected slowdown in the global EV market has accelerated this change. Many investors may not be prepared for the change.”     What I think Jonas is trying to say here is that it might suck to own Tesla stock for a while as Tesla concedes market share to everyone else while trying to get AI to work, or whatever. Again, it’s a truly insane reason, but Musk has been successful by placing a lot of seemingly dumb bets and pulling most of them off most of the time."

In this article, I analyze the Q1 sales results of three leading automakers and try to make sense of why the EV laggards did the best.   Image credit:  Good Car, Bad Car   I’m going to discuss the electrification strategy of three of the brands in the US market and how it worked for them in the 1st quarter of 2024. My expectation a year ago was that Tesla would be selling many more cars, Hyundai would be doing okay, and Toyota would be struggling as the public realized they had missed their chance to be a leader in creating great electric vehicles. It looks like I (and many others) got it 100% wrong, in the short term at least. First, I’ll cover what each of those companies reported, then I’ll describe what worked and what didn’t, and then I’ll discuss where they (and other companies) will go from here.   Tesla Had A Tough First Quarter   As  Zach covered a few days ago,  Tesla announced disappointing first quarter deliveries. I’m focusing on the US market, so I’m using the estimates from goodcarbadcar.net (Tesla doesn’t share US figures). At first glance, the 7% decline versus the 6% gain for the market doesn’t look too bad, but it is very disappointing considering that pricing on their best selling Model Y has dropped considerably.   Image credit: Aldrich “GenSao” Bautista gensao@yahoo.com     In the above table, I compared the price of the Long Range Model Y in the first quarter of 2024 to last year and the last quarter of 2022. I used the price tracker to get the prices, and where there where many prices for the quarter, I mentally averaged the prices weighted by length of time that price was available. I say mentally because I didn’t do it in a workbook, I just estimated the prices and rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. For the typical inventory discount, I listened to some videos from the  DennisCW YouTube channel  to get an idea. Most of us following Tesla know about the massive 29.7% price drop in the first quarter of last year, but I don’t see much discussion that prices have dropped an additional 19% in the last 12 months, resulting in a staggering 43% net price drop for the best selling car in the world! In addition, the tax credit became instant and is now available to many people whose income was too low to take advantage of it last year.     I used the same methods for this table, except I listed the least expensive Model Y available in each period. In the first two periods, that was the Long Range AWD, but in the most recent period, that is the RWD Model Y with 260 miles of range (instead of the 310 miles of range of the Long Range AWD). This shows the entry level Model Y price dropped even more than the apples to apples comparison I first showed. So, clearly, the price dropped considerably no matter how you look at it. From a personal standpoint, my daughter bought a Model Y a couple years ago for about $60,000, and one a few weeks ago for about $24,000 ($5,000 Colorado tax credit and some extra incentives offered the last week of the quarter explain why the price is lower than the $32,490 amount in the table above). The lower price enabled her to afford a second Tesla, even though the gas saving are minimal on that car due to only driving it about 6,000 miles a year. Improving safety and reducing maintenance and repair costs were the primary reasons for replacing the 20-year-old gas car (2003 Honda CR-V).   So, given the  MASSIVE  net price decreases explained above, why didn’t sales increase? That is a whole article in itself, but some reasons that come to mind are listed below.     Troy Teslike has stated  that Model 3 demand is strong, but that production in the US was limited due to ramping issues related to the Highland refresh.   In addition, the Model 3 lost the federal tax credit, unless you use the leasing loophole. I think this may be the most significant of the reasons and explain most of the drop.   Most people don’t know the prices have dropped so much. This is the whole “should Tesla advertise or just cut prices” debate. Even though Tesla does advertise now, most people still don’t know about the lower prices. [ Editor’s note: Also, from my experience, most Tesla advertising doesn’t emphasize the lower prices. —Zachary Shahan ]   Many people (including Elon Musk) say the increase in interest rates is responsible for the drop in Tesla sales, but if that was the case, we would see poorer sales from other makes, so I think this is a minor issue.   All the talk of the $25,000 Model 2 is  Osborning  some sales of the Model 3 and Y, but I think this is also a relatively minor issue.   Donald Trump and other Republicans have really increased their attacks on electric cars. Although most of the points they make are either partially true or totally false, they have been very effective at causing a sizable group of people to say they will never buy an electric car. See the video below for more on this.   Elon has made a lot of comments on X/Twitter that progressives don’t like. This is the group that likes electric cars the most. So, some people who would have bought a Tesla have either bought a different brand of electric or just bought a gas car because they don’t want a non-Tesla until those brands us the NACS connector and have access to most superchargers. See the video below for more on this.     VIDEO   Hyundai Had A Flat Quarter   As  we covered in more detail in this article recently , Hyundai had flat sales versus the 6% gain for the market. That looks okay, but why didn’t they exceed industry growth like they have done for most of the last 30 years? I don’t know, but my guess is the supply chain issues that have plagued Toyota and Honda are finally resolved, so a lot of people who wanted those brands might have bought a Hyundai last year because they were available but Hyundai is not getting that extra boost this year. Let’s discuss their hybrid and electric car strategy.   Hyundai is halfway between the Tesla (we only make electric cars) and Toyota (we like hybrids) strategy. Hyundai makes gas cars, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and electric cars. It makes a pretty good volume of all of those so that it is just up to the consumer to buy what they want. The quality of their hybrids and electric cars are good enough to win many awards, so I’d say they are decent. Hyundai offers two modern electric cars designed from the ground up — the  IONIQ 5  and the  2023  CleanTechnica  Car of the Year, the IONIQ 6 ! In addition, the company offers an electric version of its Kona subcompact crossover.   Hyundai’s EV sales  jumped 62% in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2023 , in spite of the fact that none of these are made in the US, so they don’t get the $7,500 tax credit unless they are leased. Hyundai (and Kia) have been much faster at pushing leasing to take advantage of that loophole than Tesla. They also let people buy out the cars at the end of the lease if they want. Hyundai was surprised by the details of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), so it is at a major disadvantage to Tesla, which has EV manufacturing in the US and some battery contracts that have enough materials from the right countries to get the full tax credit for most of their cars. Hyundai has been quick to build capacity in the US and I’m amazed it will be opening its  megaplant in Georgia in about 6 months !   Toyota Had A Great Quarter   Toyota’s sales were up 22% for the quarter, and its “electrified” car sales (mostly hybrids, but a few plug-in cars) were up 76.4% over the first quarter of last year.   Image credit: Toyota Pressroom   Looking at models, I can see that only 2% of their electrified production is fully electric, while 7% is plug-in hybrids. Although those are very low numbers, they are growing quickly, each increasing about 100% since last year. The Camry is Toyota’s second most popular car and only about 11% opt for the hybrid model, but the 2025 model coming out this spring will be 100% hybrid and may also (not announced, but rumored) be available as a plug-in model. Clearly, having reliable hybrids and plug-in hybrids is working for Toyota in the US market (it is failing miserably in the large Chinese and  European markets ).   VIDEO   This is the major risk for Toyota. If a market starts to go electric quickly (as is happening in China, Europe, and some other countries), Toyota is caught without a competitive product since it doesn’t make many EVs and the ones it does make aren’t that great. On the other hand, with the polls pretty even and the betting markets a tossup as to whether Biden will be re-elected or Trump will return to office, it’s worth noting that Toyota would fare very well in the US under a Republican administration. Even if Biden is re-elected, the  new emissions rules  give automakers the choice of making a lot of hybrids or fewer electric vehicles. They don’t care how you reduce emissions, as long as you do. Ted Ogawa recently said that he doesn’t even expect there to be demand for these recently lowered targets and Toyota plans to just buy credits instead of wasting resources designing and building electric cars he is convinced his customers don’t want. I think he is dead wrong and they will be caught without good products when the market realizes electric cars are great. But this year, he has been right and I have been wrong.   Conclusion   It is a crazy world we live in. In my opinion, Tesla has the best cars and the best plans, Hyundai has pretty good plans, and Toyota has the worst, but the first quarter has taught us that markets don’t move in straight lines. Especially as the car market has started to become more political, you can’t just pick winners by who has the best long-term strategy. Elections and campaigns are having all kinds of effects on both the automakers and the"

It announced a nearly two-week production pause at the facility in late January and early February due to a parts shortage caused by the shipping crisis in the Red Sea precipitated by Iran-backed Houthi militants. The facility also was forced to pause production for nearly a week in March due to an arson attack by an environmental activist against an  electricity transmission  facility that helped power the plant.

Tesla's Mexico Gigafactory is still a key piece of the company's future - Business Insider,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQVHMyYmI4dVo2SWJsX1ZmUGZjNmgzakZPQlBqRENkbVZDbTg4QU5DVkVEMUFSWUJTOWt2VUgxVEViUjBhR2owLUxlTEt3aU11ZE03UWlHMkVhbnZXQXRpYjZEVDNnRHAwcHB2by01bDdxZjRGZmRmVzJpMVcwVHFqUEN5WklkUQ?oc=5,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla's Mexico  Gigafactory  is taking longer to come online than expected, but building south of the US border is still likely to be a key part of the company's future. An assembly plant in Mexico, where workers are typically paid less than in the US and which is closer to Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, may offer a cheaper manufacturing hub in North America that can still supply major markets like the US with more inexpensive vehicles. Efforts like the Mexico Gigafactory are part of a trend toward "" nearshoring ,"" described as moving production closer to consumers to reduce costs and logistical complications. That's especially important as Tesla aims to keep its costs down to  protect its profit margins  at a time when customers are more price-conscious and more likely to consider hybrids over electric vehicles. Manufacturing in Mexico is already a popular cost-cutting move in the automotive industry, with many major automakers building highly profitable pickup trucks south of the border. Importing cars from China  could create significant headaches for American consumers as the US rolls out  stricter manufacturing requirements  for getting the $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit. Tesla is starting to  feel the heat  of a nearly yearlong slowdown in the electric-vehicle market. The company this month reported its lowest quarterly sales since 2022 and its first year-over-year quarterly decline since 2020. The results reflect the extent to which Elon Musk's plan to slash the prices of his most popular vehicles can work in a changing EV market.  Shoppers today  are looking for more practical green-car options, gravitating more toward legacy brands and hybrids than pure electric vehicles — the only type of car Tesla sells. Tesla's 'genius move' During an  investor presentation  in March 2023, Tesla announced plans to start manufacturing in Mexico. At the time, Sandy Munro, an automotive-manufacturing expert, called it a "" genius move "" and speculated that a long-awaited $25,000 Tesla would be built at the factory. Musk later said the affordable Tesla would first be built in Texas and could move to Mexico in the future. Despite Musk's reassurance this week that an  affordable Tesla is still on the way , he emphasized that it would be built on an existing assembly line, not a new one. That leaves Mexico in an even bigger state of flux without a product or a target opening date. Musk has been increasingly aloof about plans for the Mexico factory, saying last fall that he wasn't ready to go ""full tilt"" on a Mexico Gigafactory in a more uncertain economy. Still, Musk appears to be laying the groundwork for a manufacturing ecosystem in Mexico.  Bloomberg reported  in February that the automotive CEO had invited some of Tesla's Chinese suppliers of its Shanghai plant to Mexico."

On the upside, that hybrid approach has meant automakers continue to buy regulatory credits; Tesla earned $442 million in zero emissions tax credits in the first quarter.   “The EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug in hybrids instead,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in opening remarks on the earnings call. “We believe this is not the right strategy, and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.”   Shares pop on future promises   The results, posted after markets closed Tuesday,  sent shares up as much as 12%  following the release as investors appeared to be more focused on Tesla’s forward-looking remarks about future products, including an upended product roadmap to bring  multiple cheaper vehicles  to market by 2025.   Despite the downward trend in profits, Tesla used the first-quarter report to focus on the future, namely about using AI to make advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on a next-generation vehicle platform. The company spent $1.1 billion on research and development in the first quarter, a 49% increase from the same quarter in 2023.   Musk emphasized that despite the downward pressure, the company was focused on — and investing in — the future. Specifically, the company is accelerating work on a new vehicle lineup with production expected in early 2025, if not late this year, Musk said.   “These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms,” he said. “And we’ll be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.”   The cost of price cuts   Tesla has seen EV sales grow over the past several years, topping out to a new record of  1.8 million vehicles  in 2023. But the company’s profits have suffered thanks to repeated price cuts that started in late 2022.   While those price cuts did provide a temporary bump in sales, it hasn’t had a lasting effect. Tesla delivered  386,810 vehicles  in the first quarter of 2024, down 20% from the 484,507 it delivered in the final quarter of 2023. This wasn’t just a quarter-over-quarter blip either; Tesla delivered 8.5% fewer cars than the first quarter of 2023. Automotive gross margins, excluding regulatory credits, shrank to 16.35% in the first quarter compared to 18.96% in the same year-ago period.   Tesla warned in January that growth of its vehicle sales “may be notably lower” in 2024, noting at that time it was between “two major growth waves” and prepping for the launch of a new vehicle platform to build a smaller EV that costs around $25,000.  The company has also been prepping a “robotaxi”  built on the same platform. In the meantime, Tesla’s only new model is the  expensive (and fussy) Cybertruck ; the company has launched new variants on existing models, including the  Tesla Model 3 Performance .   Musk said during the company’s earnings call in January the smaller and cheaper EV would go into production in late 2025 at the company’s factory in Texas and eventually expand to a yet-to-be-built factory in Mexico.   Three months later, Musk appears to have changed the company’s low-cost EV playbook. Musk reportedly replaced the plan for a low-cost EV purpose-built on the new platform. Instead, he now wants to plow headlong into the robotaxi, which will be revealed in some capacity in August, while also launching “new models” that somehow use what’s being developed for that new platform.   Less than two weeks after announcing the robotaxi launch date,  Musk oversaw a 10% reduction in headcount  and a restructuring that puts autonomy in sharp focus. Two high-profile executives —  Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development  — also left the company. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said Tuesday during the earnings call that the  savings   generated  from the workforce reduction is  expected   to   be   well   in   excess   of  $ 1  billion   on   an   annual   basis.   Other revenue sources   While automotive revenues fell, there were gains in other parts of the business, notably energy storage.   The company reported that energy storage deployments increased to a record 4.1 GWh. That pushed revenue for energy generation (meaning solar) and storage to 1.6 billion in the first quarter, a 7% increase from the same quarter last year. Tesla noted that most of that growth came from increased Megapack deployments, which was partially offset by a decrease in solar installs.   The company also reported $2.28 billion in revenue from services, including capital generated from its Supercharger network. That revenue source should increase as more automakers, including Ford, GM, Rivian and VW  adopt Tesla’s technology  known as North American Charging Standard.   Tesla Semi delayed   While Tesla pushes forward on autonomy and a new product roadmap, other projects continue to be delayed. Mass production of the Tesla Semi, which was first  revealed in November 2017 , is now being pushed out another year.   The Tesla Semi, which was originally planned to go into production in 2019, has been repeatedly delayed. The company did reveal a production-ready Semi in December 2022 and delivered a handful to Pepsi, its first customer, for a pilot. But it has yet to scale up volume production.   Last June, Musk said the company wouldn’t begin producing the Class 8 big rig until the  end of 2024 . The first production Semi vehicles are now planned for late 2025 with external customers starting in 2026, according to Tesla.   Tesla is finalizing the engineering for the Semi to allow for “super cost effective high production,” according to information shared on the call.  The company shared in its first-quarter earnings report that it has started construction of a Tesla Semi factory near its so-called Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada."

Old habits with gas vehicles resurface, like forgetting to turn off the engine.                                                                     Range anxiety returns with gas-powered vehicles after being used to thoughtless EV charging.                                    A couple of weeks ago, I dropped off my beloved  Tesla Model 3  at an auto body shop for repair. Last December, a small metal ladder fell off a truck ahead of me and slammed into the side of my car. There was nothing I could do. It took almost four months for the body shop to get the necessary parts in, and now it'll take 30 days for the repairs to be finished.         Related     Thinking of EVs differently than gas cars could make prices cheaper, charging easier, and general infrastructure much more friendly.           At least I hope it's completed within 30 days. That's how long my auto insurance provider will cover the cost of a rental car. When I set everything up, I was able to choose the kind of car I'd drive for the next month. Originally I hoped there would be some sort of  EV available , but those dreams were soon crushed when I found myself staring at a Toyota Corolla as my lone option.         Last December, a small metal ladder fell off a truck ahead of me and slammed into the side of my car. There was nothing I could do.         Below I've rounded up a few things I really miss about my  Tesla , and a couple of things I enjoy about the Corolla, after leaving gas vehicles behind years ago.     Three things I hate about not having my Tesla                              I have to carry a key again        Over the last two weeks, I've had to get reacquainted with various aspects of driving a gas car again, but perhaps the one area where I've struggled with the most is with carrying a key fob. I haven't carried physical keys in five years.         Physical keys, for me, were supposed to be a thing of the past. It's a perfect setup for me. I lose things like my wallet, shoes (yes, my shoes), and Chapstick daily.         With my Tesla, my phone is my key. Locking and unlocking it is as easy as walking up to or away from it. Not to mention, you don't have to turn the car on or off. There's no start button, or an ignition you turn with a key. You get in, put it in gear and drive.         Related     And why that's a good thing for the auto industry.            My house has  smart locks  which also require my phone or a top secret code to gain entry. Physical keys, for me, were supposed to be a thing of the past. It's a perfect setup for me. I lose things like my wallet, shoes (yes, my shoes), and Chapstick daily. Sometimes multiple times a day. Adding keys to the mix, and a single key fob at that, is sure to end up in frustration.                Old habits are hard to break        Speaking of having to worry about carrying a key again. The second day of driving the Corolla, I made a quick stop at a gas station to see if they were selling solar eclipse glasses, and it wasn't until I was nearly to the entrance when I realized I'd gotten out of the car without turning it off.   Not only was the key still in the ignition and the engine still running, but the car was completely unlocked, free for the taking. Thankfully, I realized it and was able to complete a walk of shame back to the car to turn it off and lock it up.         Not only was the key still in the ignition and the engine still running, but the car was completely unlocked, free for the taking.         I've also walked up to the car expecting it to unlock, or walked away from the car leaving it unlocked almost every single time I've driven it. I've been spoiled by the ease of getting in and out of my Tesla, and I'm not sure if it's a habit I can break.         Related     Layoffs, project cancellations, Cybertruck recall and a bad fiscal quarter. Tesla once looked invincible, now it looks merely mortal.                         Range anxiety makes a comeback        For the first year or so after switching to an EV, range anxiety was a very real thing. I constantly monitored my Tesla's charge level, using various apps to calculate what my projected range would be for long drives and trying to figure out when and where to charge.   However, over the last four years, range hasn't been something I give much thought to. I leave my house every day with enough charge for my needs, and then when I come back home, I plug back in. It's a thoughtless process now.         I'm sure it'll be like riding a bike, but I can't help but shake the gas range anxiety feeling.         With the Corolla, I've found myself looking at the gas gauge with the same range anxiety feeling I'd had during my rookie year with the Tesla. I've yet to have to stop and pump gas, but that's because I haven't driven it a lot. And when I do, I'm sure it'll be like riding a bike, but I can't help but shake the gas range anxiety feeling.

Two things I love about my temporary Corolla                              Toyota's lane assist tech is pretty good        In my Tesla, I use Full Self Driving for probably 90% of my driving. It's not perfect, and I have to pay attention to every decision it makes, but it eliminates a lot of the mental energy consumed by being in complete control of a car -- especially during highway driving.         But after my first drive, which was roughly an hour of highway cruising, I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the entire drive was. I never felt like the car was leaving the lane or losing its place.         I didn't have high expectations for the overall experience of using Toyota's Safety Sense driver assistance tech, which includes Lane Tracing Assist to keep the car in a lane, and Adaptive Cruise Control to adjust your driving speed based on the car in front of you.

But after my first drive, which was roughly an hour of highway cruising, I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the entire drive was. I never felt like the car was leaving the lane or losing its place. It wasn't quite as smooth as my Tesla, but I have no complaints about Toyota's Safety Sense driver assistance features.                Wireless Apple CarPlay is fantastic        I've long been against the idea of Tesla or Rivian integrating Android Auto or Apple CarPlay into their vehicles. There are many reasons I feel this way, which I'll spare you from for now, but the gist of it is: Tesla and Rivian aren't traditional car companies, and because they're building the entire product from the ground up, they should own their software and hardware experience -- much like Apple does.         Related     CarPlay apps have changed the way you get around town. These are the most useful ones to run in 2024 for navigation, communication, and more.            That said, after figuring out that the Corolla supports Apple CarPlay, I immediately set it up. To my surprise, it supports wireless CarPlay -- which is a treat to use. You get in the car, turn it on (with the key!) and the CarPlay interface shows up on the screen, ready to give you directions with  Apple Maps  (it's the best, you can't change my mind), respond to or send messages, and blast my favorite Apple Music playlists.   I still don't want CarPlay in my Tesla, but there's a small part of me that misses it."

Revenue fell 9% from a year ago, Tesla's first drop in four years.   Tesla reported $1.2 billion in operating profit in the first quarter and $1.5 billion in adjusted net income. Both numbers were short of forecasts and down more than 50% from a year ago. In terms of delivery guidance, Tesla said it still sees ""notably lower volume,"" echoing what the company said in its Q4 earnings report.   In its shareholder letter, Tesla also showed preview images of a ridehailing feature in its app showing how a Tesla robotaxi could work.     Tesla's preview of the ride-hailing feature coming to Tesla's App.   ·   Tesla   Prior to Tesla's Q1 report, shares had been hit hard this year after the company reported  Q4 results that disappointed , issued weak and non-specific 2024 delivery guidance,  missed on Q1 deliveries , and did  not refute reports of the demise of a sub-$30,000 volume EV .   The revenue drop and profitability slide follow a  weaker-than-expected quarter of sales  for Tesla.   In Q1, Tesla reported 386,810 global deliveries, well below estimates of 449,080, and produced 433,371 vehicles, also below estimates of 452,976. Tesla did note in the first quarter report that Cybertruck production hit 1000 units a week in April.       Story Continues   The difference of around 46,500 vehicles produced versus sold  led to concerns of demand waning  globally for Tesla vehicles, which in turn has led to round after round of price cuts. On Monday, Tesla cut prices for vehicles in the US and China, leading to weakness in the stock during the day.   Nonetheless, Tesla confirmed that the long-awaited next-generation platform would underpin a sub-$30,000 mainstream EV — dubbed the Model 2. That's a huge deal for investors, many of whom see the low-cost EV as a volume play for Tesla. Tesla said upcoming vehicles, including the affordable models, would use aspects of the next-gen platform as well as existing platforms, allowing them to be built on the same assembly lines as current vehicles. The ""purpose-built robotaxi,"" on the other hand, will use the revolutionary ""unboxed"" production line to be made, Tesla said. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Recent Tesla Full Self Driving Fails — Just A Blip In The Progress? Or Endemic? - CleanTechnica,https://news.google.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?oc=5,"Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:31:02 GMT","Sign up for  CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries , sign up for  our daily newsletter , and/or  follow us on Google News !       With Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) version 12.3 being much more natural and usable than previous versions, I have been using it more in order to track its progress and try to understand it better. It’s still much more enjoyable to drive the car myself, but the technology is truly amazing, a marvel. To get to the level it’s at is a very cool achievement.   Though, I consistently return to my concern that both the hardware approach and the software approach are inadequate for robotaxi services.   One key issue is that the cameras are simply not always able to see well enough for FSD to operate. I have just one single Tesla, not 100, 1000, or one million. You need hardware that works well beyond 99% of the time in every FSD Tesla on the road in order to have a safe robotaxi service. If my one car is inadequate when it comes to the hardware, it’s clear that we are light years from the finish line. The other day, we were getting some light rain. It’s not summer and we aren’t yet being hit with huge thunderstorms, which I expect will present serious visibility challenges. This was quite light rain. I tried to turn on FSD to see how it did in these conditions. It wouldn’t turn on. Apparently, the little bit of rain we were getting was too much of a challenge for my car’s cameras.       So, there’s that.   There’s an argument that as the neural nets get to work, as Tesla processes more data and improves, the AI can operate under more and more difficult conditions even with current hardware. I’m not sold. I see it struggling too much relying on cameras. I see enough “edge cases” (common edge cases, I would actually call them) that I don’t think “vision only” is adequate. I may be wrong. People in the field believe I’m wrong. Other people in the field believe I’m right — or, I should say, have the same opinion.   Early-morning sunlight and late-day sunlight also cause visibility problems. Again, when Tesla’s cameras and FSD system face these problems, it could find a way to work around them just like humans do, but I’m not confident of that at the moment. At the least, we have to acknowledge it’s a problem  today . We can all have different opinions regarding Tesla AI’s ability to solve the problem in time.   As I was scanning X/Twitter this morning to see what Tesla discussions are happening there, I also ran across these two tweets:       1. “ FSD 12.3.4 turned left from a straight only lane coming out of a very popular mall parking lot. Someone was right next to me in the correct left turn lane & it cut them off. Talk about _awkward_! “   Turning from the wrong lane and cutting off another car is not good. It’s shocking that this is still happening, in my humble opinion. Maybe it will be solved soon and this will stop happening. But it’s still a serious problem and highly dangerous.   2. “ 12.3.4 also tried to stop at a green light, almost creating a rear end collision.”   This one is even more shocking and even more concerning for me. How can the system still confuse a green light for a red light in some situations? How bad are the cameras in certain conditions or in certain ways if this is happening? If it’s purely a software issue instead of a hardware issue, what the heck went wrong? Of all the issues I’ve seen still occuring with version 12.3, this is the one that shocks and concerns me the most.   3. “There was a car on our left waiting to turn left, waiting on opposing traffic to clear. Our Tesla jumped out into the middle of the road and had a path planned that would have no doubt resulted in a major traffic accident with the fast moving SUV, had my wife not slammed on the brakes.”   This one feels like something that would be solved and avoided in the future with growing data and processing. However, it’s the scariest failure I’ve seen with the current version of FSD — it seems that slightly more faith in what FSD was doing or slightly less attentiveness from the driver and human lives could have been ended. It makes me think that we could have a very clear, heartbreaking, and public FSD death any day. And what would that do for Tesla FSD progress, by the way?   Robotaxis Right Around the Corner?   I do not claim to know what is going to happen with Tesla FSD and potential robotaxis in the coming months and years. I’ve seen too much and have listened to too many arguments on both sides. However, if I was forced to make a guess right now, I’d guess that Tesla’s approach is not going to work (again) and will need some serious restructuring. Yes, the system solves some problems as it changes, but I’m still concerned it creates other problems along the way as well. I’m concerned about what I wrote  months ago   almost two years ago  —  a “see saw problem” of solutions in certain cases leading to mistakes in other very similar but critically different cases . (I’m actually shocked to discover I wrote that article  almost two years ago .)   Actually, I recommend going through the comments there. Many people were defending Tesla’s approach and claiming Elon knew best (as he always does) when it came to the approach the company was using then. It turns out, that approach was inadequate and was ditched after all. So, who was right at the time? Should we have just trusted Elon and his AI chops then? Should we have just trusted him and the Tesla team he was working with in 2020, or in 2018? You could say what Tesla was doing then led to where we are now in a clear and useful way, and that we had to start there to get here. Okay, that’s one argument. However, should we expect that  now  the approach is correct and we just need more time and data? Yes, the system is better today than it once was, but it is still so far from robotaxi capability that I think it takes a very large leap of faith — a reckless leap of faith — to assume that Tesla is now on the perfect path, or right path, to robotaxi capability.   Again, for extra fun, I highly recommend exploring  the comment thread on that article  again.       Whether you have solar power or not, please complete  our latest solar power survey .

Paying Elon a Cool $56 Billion, Of Course. - The American Prospect",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNdHJDUWVrNGwyQVZ3SEUwYjFtUlBGNmk0TTV0RlRJcFhkaFdCLTRVRnpRSks4YTBfVFphUVIxLXR1MnlYQk1ranNfZVBEMXNEZUk0RHprOTM3SUswQy1VMC1rcmVwaWZSUVBneTdYcjhMLXV3cDBrLWNLLXZqWm5FTS14YlBJandYUHgtdkY5X2YwZ3lfWWx6UTlMQ1MwdnIyZ2xWdVZB?oc=5,"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla is in trouble.   Yesterday, the company announced that its profits for the first three months of this year fell by 55 percent from the first three months of 2023. Sales declined by 8.5 percent. Its stock price has fallen by 65 percent since its high point three years ago, and by roughly 40 percent just since January 1. The company recently laid off 10,000 of its workers.   So what’s a CEO to do? What investments can Tesla make to restore its plummeting industry leadership? Build a more affordable product? That was the hope some investors had for later this year, though yesterday, the company announced it wouldn’t get around to that until late 2025. Its chief focus, CEO Elon Musk made clear, was building partly autonomous robotaxis—its own model of the robocabs that have been crashing their way around San Francisco.   Perhaps Musk could also focus a bit more on the company, since his associates have noted that he seems more interested in SpaceX and X (the company that used to be Twitter) these days. Perhaps he could be less of an obstreperous right-wing jerk, since the percentage of Democrats buying Teslas, which they once patronized because of their inherently green aspects, has fallen by 60 percent, according to a  survey  reported in  The Wall Street Journal , ever since Musk began broadcasting his ideological and characterological affinities with Donald Trump.   More from Harold Meyerson   More broadly, the days when Tesla was the only, and then the dominant, player in the electric-car market are long gone. Even without its lassitude in producing more affordable vehicles, even without the siren songs of space shots and Twitter calumnies that have distracted Musk from his cars, Tesla’s role in the market has inevitably shrunk as U.S., Asian, and European competitors have scaled up their own production.   So, are a chastened Tesla and Musk redirecting the company’s resources into building a better, more affordable car? Not exactly.   Instead, the company reaffirmed yesterday that it will ask its shareholders to authorize a special payment to Musk of roughly $56 billion.   Now, there’s a well-established American corporate tradition of rewarding their CEO fuckups with large paychecks. David Calhoun, whom Boeing recently showed the door after various other doors were found to be loosely attached, if attached at all, to some Boeing-made planes, will get a going-away present of between $26 million and $45 million, according to a  report  in  Fortune . Warner Bros. Discovery had a lousy year in 2023, losing $3 billion, but it somehow managed to reward its CEO, David Zaslav, with a $50 million paycheck.   All this is chump change, of course, compared to what Musk has asked Tesla to pay him. Fifty  billion  dollars is a thousand times more than Zaslav’s puny 50 million. It’s roughly the same size as the GDP of Montana—not our richest state, to be sure, but not our poorest either. Unlike every other payoff to fuckup CEOs, or, for that matter, to  non -fuckup CEOs, it’s so large it could make a measurable difference in America’s Gini coefficient, which tracks a nation’s levels of economic inequality.   Why does Musk, already the world’s richest human, want a $56 billion paycheck from Tesla? Some reporting has suggested he wants to recoup the roughly $44 billion he shelled out to purchase Twitter—a purchase that was bad for Tesla, bad for Twitter, and bad for truth.   Why is Tesla’s board so insistent on shoveling the equivalent of the economic value of Montana to Musk? For one thing, the board doesn’t exactly run herd on Elon.  The   Wall Street Journal ’s  reporting  has made clear Musk’s domination of his ostensible overseers, as this passage from one of the  Journal ’s stories suggests:   In the culture Musk has created around him, some friends, including directors, feel there is an expectation to consume drugs with him because they think refraining could upset the billionaire, who has made them a lot of money, some of the people said. More so, they don’t want to risk losing the social capital that comes from being close to Musk, which for some feels akin to having proximity to a king.   Which makes clear why Tesla’s board announced earlier this month that, notwithstanding a Delaware court’s ruling that struck down a previous version of this payout, they were going to submit it again to the company’s shareholders.   And finally, why have those corporate shakedown artists whom the media refer to as “activist investors” been silent in the face of this massive misappropriation of shareholders’ money? When corporations pay their workers “too much,” or go in for affirmative action hiring, the cries of outrage from the likes of Bill Ackman, Carl Icahn, and Nelson Peltz assault the heavens, assuming the heavens tune in to CNBC. But when the world’s richest man appropriates $56 billion for himself, these billionaires, in a burst of either class solidarity or naked envy, remain strategically mute. So much for Ackman, Icahn, and Peltz.   There is, however, one positive by-product to Elon Musk’s determination to grab $56 billion from his shareholders and employees: It strengthens the case—growing stronger every day—for expropriating the fortunes of the rich."

Tesla unveils more details about driverless ride-hailing service - IoT Tech News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNTGZXRDZGTElFcDhaejVNRjhIMVFaSXRRcWhoTFFlUGFnNS1DWVVaX1p5MnpYYUpyX3VYTmdYV2QyNXIyQWYtVXFKcE1MRG8xUXNXRkNiOW93eTJpR1cwR3lFdEhhV0l3TEJJaHlTSnhoTmZrOER5QzBUamxISDdoOEJrZ2t4Y1NET3E1dGluWFRCUQ?oc=5,"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","During a first-quarter earnings presentation on Tuesday,  Tesla  provided glimpses of what riders could expect from their future app designed to summon driverless cars through an intuitive interface reminiscent of popular ridesharing platforms like Uber and Lyft.   The upcoming ride-hailing service will allow users the ability to conveniently call for a Tesla vehicle, adjust the temperature inside the car, track its location in real-time, and customise their music:   Screenshot   (Credit:  Tesla )   Tesla’s ambitions with robotaxis have been public knowledge since 2019 when CEO Elon Musk declared that he was “very confident” the company would commence operating a fleet of driverless vehicles by the end of 2020. However, despite initial expectations, this goal has yet to be realised.   Musk revealed on Thursday that the new service will operate similarly to a hybrid model combining elements of Airbnb and Uber. Under this scheme, Tesla will manage the majority of their fleet, but individual car owners would also have control over whether or not they choose to participate in the program. Owners can selectively allow certain individuals — such as friends and family members — to use their vehicles while denying access to others who may fall outside their desired criteria.   In an effort to ensure maximum safety, Musk stressed that every Tesla vehicle will be equipped with sophisticated sensors capable of detecting potential hazards around the car and alert passengers accordingly. Additionally, in emergency situations where intervention is required, a human driver can still take control to ensure passenger safety.   Despite his previous claim that an initial fleet would consist of approximately seven million vehicles, Musk revealed during Thursday’s earnings call that the eventual size could expand significantly—potentially reaching tens of millions of cars in the future. The company plans to demonstrate its purpose-built robotaxi, dubbed “Cybercab,” at a grand reveal slated for August.   Tesla’s new ride-hailing service will also offer car owners additional revenue streams by allowing them to monetise their vehicles during off hours when they aren’t in use—with the company taking a percentage of the profits and passing on the rest to the vehicle owner. Readers may want to take this claim with a pinch of salt, but Musk predicts that each participating Tesla vehicle could generate an estimated $30,000 in gross earnings annually for its owners.   Full details of Tesla’s autonomous ride-hailing service are set to be revealed at an event in August.

Robotaxi regulators say Tesla hasn't contacted them about plans - NBC News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQUFFCcVRfV0YyaGJLWEhsRlc2Z3k5Q3NXRU5FN2kyNDNIeUJOVEoyN01SUEprYUhjdEdRMERONkxLMTFOa1VrTS1TQ25qZmo4WmRYQ0RIUUpmTFVKZDNpSmlWVUVNMnd4NjV2eUFqTnV0N2tZczRVTDd3dUJZUHBmWjVVMmJsODYzSlhGa3JiT1gxTlFfUER1WHo1WmtuSzRRUEgzSdIBVkFVX3lxTE1IOG4yTTQ5MEpDRFNFcGpBY3NWT3hSelh4eDJhTUhmY2dyZnRtX0xtenZMclhiM3NLQ0dIbnViNWw3SEMyRHVwbkRER1l5cTBYTS1aRXZn?oc=5,"Thu, 11 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","SAN FRANCISCO — Two California agencies that regulate robotaxis said they haven’t heard from Tesla about its plans for the cars, even though Tesla CEO Elon Musk  announced  last week that he’ll reveal a new robotaxi product in August.  The California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, said in separate statements to NBC News that Tesla hadn’t applied for the two permits it would need to operate a driverless car service in the country’s most populous state.  Two other states that regulate robotaxis, Arizona and Nevada, also said they had not heard from Tesla about its plans.  The lack of permits — or any attempt to acquire them — raises questions about how quickly Tesla would be able to get a robotaxi service up and running.  “Tesla’s a long way away from getting that approval,” said Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry.  Representatives for Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.  California, which has been ground zero for the rollout of robotaxis, requires aspiring robotaxi services to obtain at least two permits. The DMV handles permits to deploy autonomous equipment on the road, and Tesla currently has the  lowest-level permit , allowing it to test autonomous vehicles with human drivers present. Only three companies have the highest-level permit, which allows them to deploy autonomous vehicles without human drivers.  “Tesla has not applied for a deployment permit with the DMV,” the department said in a statement in response to questions.  If Tesla were to deploy robotaxis that are autonomous, it added, “the DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits.”  The CPUC handles permits to operate robotaxis as businesses, including for tech startup Waymo’s services in  San Francisco  and  Los Angeles . Tesla has no CPUC permit and hasn’t applied, the commission said.  “If Tesla wanted to provide a robotaxi service they’d need to follow the same rules as other such companies (i.e., DMV approval for driverless testing/deployment before seeking a CPUC permit). The CPUC has not been contacted for such a permit,” the commission said in a statement in response to questions.  Waymo, a spinoff of Google, needed eight months to get its initial CPUC permit to operate a robotaxi business that could charge fares, as opposed to offering free test rides only.  It applied  in December 2022 and  won approval  in August.  Templeton said it’s possible Tesla’s timeline for approval could be shorter than eight months — or longer.  “It could also be that they think Tesla is premature and they never approve it,” he said. Templeton is a former member of Google’s self-driving car team, which became Waymo, but he left a decade ago and said he no longer has ties to the company.  Tesla has approached the challenge of self-driving technology differently from Waymo, for example. Tesla has relied less on expensive hardware sensors  such as LiDAR , and it has deployed driver assistance systems in stages nationwide while Waymo and General Motors subsidiary Cruise focused on mastering small geographic areas, such as parts of the Phoenix and San Francisco metro areas.  Tesla does not yet have publicly released technology for a car to drive without human supervision. Its “full self-driving” product requires a human driver to be present and ready to take over at any time. Each state handles robotaxi regulation differently, and it’s possible that Tesla could seek to launch a service without California, although it would mean cutting out a major market. Tesla was the No. 2 seller of new cars and light trucks in the state last year, with 230,589 new registrations, behind only Toyota, according to a  report  from the California New Car Dealers Association.  Musk hinted at his plans in a brief post late Friday afternoon on X, writing: “Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8.”  He gave no details about his plans, but the post boosted the morale of Tesla fans on social media who had watched the company get battered in the business media and on Wall Street. Three days earlier, Tesla shares fell after the company reported a  drop  in deliveries, but on Monday, the next trading day after Musk’s post, Tesla’s share price rose 4.9%,  Reuters reported .  Tesla message boards have been rife with speculation about what Musk’s August announcement would be. It’s not even clear whether Musk plans to announce a vehicle, a service or something else.  Musk has talked about a robotaxi service for years. In 2019,  he discussed plans  to launch a robotaxi fleet using Tesla vehicles that people had leased and then returned. That strategy would have  shifted the startup costs  of building a fleet — in particular, the depreciation costs — to leaseholders, drivers and analysts  noted at the time .  Musk has also  talked about  a robotaxi service with decentralized ownership, in which Tesla owners could rent out their cars for fares.  Tesla may need authorization from various states or localities to operate a nationwide robotaxi fleet.  In Arizona, Waymo and Cruise have  permits  from the state Transportation Department to operate as “transportation network companies,” or TNCs, and it says a similar permitting process would apply to companies with similar services.  The Arizona DOT “has not received any TNC paperwork from Tesla,” spokesperson Bill Lamoreaux said in an email. “That said, it is our understanding that Tesla is neither operating autonomous vehicles nor a transportation network company in Arizona at this time.”  The department has also not received paperwork from Tesla for a second, separate  process  to self-certify autonomous vehicles, he said.  Cruise, which also obtained California permits for a robotaxi service,  halted  operations nationwide last year after one of its cars in San Francisco failed to detect a pedestrian pinned underneath it and then dragged her for 20 feet. California officials also accused Cruise of failing to properly disclose details of the incident, and they revoked Cruise’s permits. Cruise said this week it was resuming testing with human drivers.  Amazon subsidiary Zoox  has said  it has authorization from Nevada to operate a robotaxi service, which hasn’t launched. Nevada has a “self-certification” process for robotaxi operations, and the Nevada DMV says it will issue a “ certificate of compliance ” to those eligible.  The Nevada DMV has not received paperwork from Tesla to begin the certification process, said Eli Rohl, a department spokesperson, but he said the process doesn’t need to take long.  “If Tesla was interested in getting certified or permitted in Nevada, they could likely do so in short order,” he said in an email.  Tesla already has a rocky relationship with California regulators. In 2022, the California DMV  accused it  of engaging in deceptive practices around the marketing of its driver assistance systems, including using the product name “Full Self-Driving.” An administrative hearing in that matter is scheduled for September."
"Tesla layoffs an 'ominous sign' for the company, analyst says - Yahoo Finance",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQVGdndDdsVHl4MmxrMlk1MXN6R2hQZTVmLUI0ckRYR2hlb2RUQ1NfbC1UQWc5X1VDQVRhSU9qdTZLSHlTRlRIczFiVTFXWkQxR191M19nZ2xNSTgxSTZfazg0aU1kOWJkTXhGblRtTlg0bmJRWGEtdVdLVGVqWkExdE9DamUzYWlGOTk2SGZGaU9wTl9jVDdwYzVaWndmYURReFRSUzNoUQ?oc=5,"Mon, 15 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla ( TSLA ) has announced a large reduction in staff on the heels of a disappointing Q1 delivery report, following in the footsteps of legacy automakers and pure-play EV makers, per an internal memo.   As first reported by  EV blog Electrek , CEO Elon Musk emailed staff confirming a ""more than 10%"" headcount reduction following  prior reports  that layoffs could hit as much as 20% of staff.   “As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” Musk wrote in the memo. “As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done.”   With Tesla’s headcount sitting at around 140,000 workers globally, the reduction is likely to affect at least 14,000 workers. Tesla stock closed down 5.6% on Monday to hit its lowest closing level in nearly a year.   NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price   •   USD               After hours: 7:59:59 PM EDT     For Tesla, the layoffs come following a  disappointing Q1 delivery report  that showed the company missed widely on consensus estimates and built up supply in excess of 46,000 vehicles. This implies that Tesla is feeling the impact of slowing EV demand, both in the US and globally, after reporting its first year-over-year quarterly decline in deliveries since 2020.   Noted Tesla bull Dan Ives  at Wedbush Securities warned the layoffs were a negative sign for Tesla, as seen in Monday’s move lower. Ives has a $300 price target and Buy rating on the stock.   “This is an ominous signal that speaks to tough times ahead for Tesla as Musk navigated this Category 5 storm,” Ives said in a comment to Yahoo Finance. “Demand has been soft globally, and this is an unfortunately necessary move for Tesla to cut costs with a softer growth outlook.”     People walk to the Tesla Gigafactory for electric cars in Gruenheide near Berlin, Germany, on March 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File)   ·   ASSOCIATED PRESS   Musk has  complained in the past that high rates and higher overall prices  are a hindrance to EV adoption and said lower prices are the key to driving growth. Investors and analysts believed part of Tesla's big growth story would be its long-rumored next-gen vehicle that would start at around $25,000; however,  reports last week suggested Tesla had canceled  the vehicle. Musk responded to the report claiming it was false and revealed that a Tesla robotaxi debut would be coming on Aug. 8.   Tesla is expected to report earnings on Tuesday, April 23, and will likely provide more commentary on the layoffs, their impact on its financials, and the company's near-term demand.   Not all of the Wall Street community sees today’s layoff announcement as necessarily a bad thing."

Two Syracuse University faculty members shared their reactions to this news in the comments below. If you’d like to schedule an interview with either of them, please reach out to Vanessa Marquette, media relations specialist, at  vrmarque@syr.edu .   Matthew Huber , a professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, specializes in energy and capitalism, climate politics, and resource geography. He writes: “Our political leaders continue to say we can trust the green transition to the private sector, and time and time again they prove they’re not up to the task. Tesla should be expanding employment and investment in more affordable EVs and they’re doing the opposite because they prioritize their stock price and profits over responding to climate change.”   Lynne Vincent , associate professor at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management, studies industrial and labor relations and organizational behavior. She writes: “Given the changes in the electric vehicle market and the increased viability of competitors, the strain that Tesla is feeling is not surprising. Tesla might have been an early mover in the electric vehicle market, but they are not the only mover now. Other organizations are on their tail now. Tesla is facing external threats from competitors and internal challenges such as Rohan Patel, senior global director of public policy and business development, and Andrew Baglino, senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, leaving the organization. Tesla will have to make some choices about how to manage these changes and support their remaining workforce. The remaining employees will be experiencing significant anxiety and concern right now regarding their futures at the organization and how their work processes will be changing. Replacing Baglino and Patel also will be challenging. If Tesla is lucky, their exits were planned, and Tesla has a leadership succession plan in place.”"

Tesla highlights rights of uncontacted tribes in report – a “wake-up call” for businesses and governments - Survival International,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTFBsWE1KREdHbFBVZWJ2ZmhUalRJOFdSUXlYeFM0eGR0Q3BlWFFZeFBoZk5mQVdxM1VScGZTNTB3QWtyUVJQOTBUNDdWU0U0X0JkZjF5YVFWMFJWX0tS?oc=5,"Thu, 23 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","© Anon In recent footage, two uncontacted Hongana Manyawa men warned bulldozer operators to stay off their territory. Tesla announced today that the company is exploring “the need for the establishment of a no-go zone for mining to protect indigenous and human rights, particularly those of uncontacted communities”, demonstrating that the rights of uncontacted Indigenous peoples can be a major business concern, campaigners say.   Tesla’s statement linking the rights of uncontacted Indigenous peoples to the need for a “no-go zone” — where no mining or other activities can take place — is the latest sign that global pressure over the rights of such peoples is having an impact on companies’ supply chain decisions.    Tesla's announcement in its  2023 Impact Report  is featured in a chapter about social and environmental impacts in Indonesia, and has huge implications for nickel mining in the country. It follows a  Survival International campaign  highlighting how the world’s biggest nickel mine, operated by Weda Bay Nickel (WBN) in Indonesia, could wipe out the  uncontacted Indigenous Hongana Manyawa people .    An Indigenous Hongana Manyawa man who has uncontacted relatives in the forest gave Survival a message for electric vehicle companies and those who buy electric cars: “This is the message directly from the forest, please don't destroy our forest, we need it.”   The WBN mine, in Halmahera, is a joint venture between French mining company Eramet and Chinese company Tsingshan, and is the subject of widespread criticism for operating on the territory of uncontacted Hongana Manyawa people without their consent. WBN, which commenced operation in 2019 and is intending to operate for many decades to come, is seeking to produce materials for electric car companies. Eramet is in talks with German chemical giant BASF to process nickel for electric car batteries.   © Eramet The rainforests of Halmahera Island, home to the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa, are being rapidly destroyed for nickel mining.   Tesla, which is not currently sourcing nickel from WBN, made clear that it expects its suppliers to only operate on Indigenous people’s lands with their Free, Prior and Informed Consent. This is impossible to obtain from uncontacted peoples, as explicitly recognised by the UN and the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA).   The Tesla statement follows a recent decision by major Italian leather manufacturer Pasubio to change suppliers after campaigners revealed some of its leather was sourced from illegal cattle ranches on uncontacted Ayoreo people’s lands in Paraguay. Survival had launched a complaint against Pasubio under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.   More than 20,000 Survival supporters around the world have emailed Eramet, BASF, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others, calling on the companies to take a stand against nickel and cobalt mining on the territory of the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa in Halmahera.   Caroline Pearce, Survival International’s Director, said today: “This is a huge wake-up call. Survival has been pointing out for years that mining, ranching, and oil and gas drilling on the lands of uncontacted Indigenous peoples are not just a violation of Indigenous rights, but a human disaster that brings disease, death and even genocide. Now that public awareness and concern is mounting, companies and governments cannot keep ignoring this — as recent statements by Pasubio and now Tesla make abundantly clear.   “The situation for the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa is particularly stark and urgent: they have not given, and cannot give, their consent to the destruction of their forest, and if mining companies persist in tearing up their land, they risk wiping them out totally. No company can source mineral from the land of the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa without risking being complicit in genocide. Eramet, BASF and the other companies involved must put in place a no-go zone for mining to avert disaster before it is too late.”       Notes to Editors:    1. Out of a total population of approximately 3,000 Hongana Manyawa people, between 300 and 500 are uncontacted, and could be wiped out. Mining destroys their rainforest home, and the mine workers bring diseases for which the uncontacted people have no immunity.    2. Survival is calling on all electric vehicle companies, including BMW, Volkswagen, and BYD, to commit to not source any materials from uncontacted tribes’ territories and for Tesla to make this their formal policy.   3. In recent years, the Indonesian government has been trying to attract Tesla to invest in their nickel market. Tesla’s statement is likely to cause shockwaves in Indonesia.    4. The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) Standard, which Eramet and BASF claim to uphold, has strong wording on the rights of uncontacted tribes and specifically states that ‘IRMA will not certify a mine if affected communities include indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation [uncontacted]’.   5. Tesla does not specifically mention WBN in its suppliers list or elsewhere in the impact report but WBN’s mine aims to produce materials for the electric vehicle market."
A Conversation with David Colombo: From Tesla Hacker to Cyber Risk Advisor - Teneo,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxOZHpoVWZSclBOVmZzcHNzdk5fODRyNi16TkVGZEt2Tkw5UXhtSmE5b0ZaNUtFbVRIeV81dWEzQ09SRXo3MXJKRW9UNXJLVnFoQ0s3dUloOHNHT0xsUXByWUxSSzBfcm9oQ0NKT2c3cGc1YnhqT1FXSjhUOWxVY0lROGdFVzJpTExGdHoxQU56UU1pQ0hTMWtVYWhyYjM2Y2ZBdGhsb1gzUVFhWTNrQTZRcWtVY20?oc=5,"Tue, 21 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","David Colombo, the 19-year-old who hacked Tesla cars in 2022 now advises global governments and corporate executives on cyber risk, demonstrating that curiosity can be a powerful source for good. In March of this year, the Wall Street Journal reported on the incredible  story  of a global band of teenage cyber criminals who hacked casino conglomerate MGM in one of the biggest and most well-known cyberattacks of 2023. Intrigued by the motivations and mindset of the attackers behind the criminal gang, Teneo Risk sat down with ethical hacker David Colombo, himself a teenager when he became famous for “breaking into” over 25 Teslas around the world from his living room in Germany. David shared details of how he found and reported the security flaws to Tesla, but also discussed the seriousness of today’s cyber threat actors; what he sees as the biggest cybersecurity challenges for organizations today; and how he counsels executives on the risk. Teneo Risk:  David, tell us a little bit about yourself, your background, where you're from, how you got into computers and ethical hacking? David Colombo:  I'm from rural Bavaria, Germany – a town with about 200 people and frankly, cybersecurity isn't really a topic. But I'm just a curious person, if you want to summarize me in one word. I have always asked myself how things work. I got my first laptop for my 10th birthday and thought it was so cool because I was able to connect to the Internet and run different programs. I started wondering how this device could access, manage and process so much at the same time but couldn’t find anyone who could really tell me how it all works. Then I discovered that I can Google and research everything myself which really opened up the world of coding to me as well, prompting me to build my first website. A few years later, when I got into cybersecurity, I found my first security vulnerability by accident and I could see that cybersecurity was going to be one of the most pressing challenges going forward when we have literally digitized our entire lives from smart homes to autonomous cars. I also started to see in the news that hospitals, airplanes and our water infrastructure were becoming targets and the topic grabbed my attention. Eventually, in my mid-teens, I started my own consultancy because I really wanted to work with organizations and use my knowledge to help them protect themselves. Teneo Risk:  Let's talk about the Tesla hack. For the record, you are an ethical hacker. This wasn't for criminal purposes. You discovered a vulnerability and explored it, correct? David Colombo : Absolutely. I'm not a car guy, I'm a computer guy and Tesla is essentially a computer on wheels. It has a lot more centralized computing than most automobiles. So, coming back again to the topic of curiosity, I wanted to understand how the cars worked. However, I didn’t have a Tesla, nor did I know anyone with a Tesla, but every Tesla connects to the Internet for software and application updates which gave me my starting point to explore Teslas from home. I didn’t begin with the intention of finding a vulnerability or hacking into something. I just wanted to understand how the car worked. After some research, I discovered that every Tesla connects to something called the “mothership,” which is the main server that all the Teslas connect to and communicate with. Further, I found a specific open-source logging tool called TeslaMate which lets Tesla owners monitor data, including a car’s energy consumption, location history and music history among other things. Since this logging tool is open source, I was able to review the code myself. Without getting too technical, this is how I found the security flaw which allowed me to access digital keys used to authenticate cars and users. Having access to those digital keys then allowed me to view information about specific cars through TeslaMate. Next, I thought I may be able to send commands to the cars, but I needed to get in touch with owners in order to test that out. Teneo Risk:  How did you find Tesla owners? David Colombo:  Through TeslaMate I could see names of cars. Many Tesla owners name their cars – sometimes using funny or creative names. Similarly, through Google queries, I found social media posts in which car owners talked about their Teslas by name. When I found a match, I reached out to the owner on Twitter (now X) who at first didn’t believe that I had access to his Tesla. The first thing he asked me for was the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to prove I was serious, so I went back to the logs, got the VIN and messaged it back to him. He confirmed it was his car and then gave me permission to run some “tests.” So, I honked his horn and locked his doors which he acknowledged. This was when I knew that Tesla had a potentially serious issue, because I could literally figure out where the car was. If I had been in the car’s vicinity, I could have walked up to the car, turned off the security mode, unlocked the doors, climbed in, started the engine and taken a road trip. Teneo Risk:  News stories from 2022 noted that you were able to reach 25 cars this way, correct? David Colombo:  Yes. I tested it with 25 cars because I wanted to see if this was unique to one car or a broader security issue. Teneo Risk:  Did you contact Tesla? David Colombo:  Definitely. After 25 Teslas I knew this was something that had to be addressed with the company. This is where the ethical part comes in. When you find these “bugs” or security flaws, it’s necessary to get in touch with the relevant organizations and report it. I consolidated the technical details into a report which covered those 25 Teslas in 13 countries, including Germany, Belgium, Finland, Denmark, the UK, the U.S. and Canada, and sent it to Tesla. The company later revoked thousands of digital keys associated with their cars. In addition, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) rated the  security flaw  with a 9.8/10, which is “critical.” Teneo Risk:  Switching gears (pun intended), the very public and high-profile MGM hack that happened in September 2023 was carried out at the hands of a ransomware gang. In March of this year, the Wall Street Journal reported on the story in great detail and we learned that the criminals behind that attack were actually a group of English-speaking teenagers from around the world. These teenagers are clearly not ethical hackers like you. Was this a unique situation with this teenage criminal gang or could we expect to see more of this? David Colombo:  For me, it was really fascinating when I first learned about the age of those hackers. They are suspected to be between 18 and 24 years’ old, so they are still very young and are conducting cyber-attacks against massive organizations. We can see that the age of cyber criminals has dropped significantly over the past decade mainly because it has become so much easier for young people to get access to hacking tools. It may seem very attractive for a teenager because they can just open their laptop, anonymously hack an organization and then ask for $1,000,000 in ransom in one go. There is this perceived incentive system for young people when it comes to cybercrime, but recent high-profile arrests of cybercriminals by law enforcement will hopefully be a wake-up call to these individuals. Unfortunately, I don’t think a lot of young people have opportunities to hack for good and are drawn to the bad side of cyber. I've seen it myself in Germany. If you live in a small town without much access to opportunity or encouragement to “do the right thing,” you may be drawn in a different direction. Teneo Risk:  Are you discussing this issue with governments and private sector organizations to make them aware of the need to provide awareness, education and opportunities for young people in cybersecurity? How are organizations and governments thinking about incentivizing young people to get into cybersecurity for the right reasons? David Colombo:  This speaks to education and schools, where it must start very early on. We need to showcase that there are great opportunities for careers in cybersecurity and that it is needed in every industry and every sector. For example, there are cybersecurity jobs in government, big tech, healthcare, entertainment and sports, therefore, it’s important to showcase that you can go anywhere and leverage cybersecurity skills. In my opinion, we have made a lot of progress there. If we look at bug bounty programs, for example, we now have organizations openly offering programs whereby if a hacker finds vulnerabilities, there is an avenue to report them – and in some instances, receive compensation. That was also the case with Tesla. They have a bug bounty program that allows hackers to find vulnerabilities, but they must be reported. The U.S. has made real advances here, but other regions haven’t progressed bug bounty programs in the same way and we need more companies to adopt these policies to increase cybersecurity. Separately, we need to build programs where we identify young people with critical skills and an interest in cybersecurity and give them opportunities to put their skills to work. Teneo Risk:  What are you spending most of your time on at the moment? David Colombo:  It’s very mixed. I don't think I have the same day twice. On the one hand, I'm doing a lot of consulting. I'm working with organizations to help them better understand cybersecurity from a hacker's perspective, because most organizations only think about cyber risk from a corporate operating perspective. Looking at the problem through the lens of a hacker provides an entirely different viewpoint regarding motivation and intent. Much of the conversation and insights I have access to occurs inside hacker circles. I think sharing that information with a broader audience is of real benefit. Separately, I started coding around the topic of AI and cybersecurity, mainly to l"

Have the wheels come off for Tesla? - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE9RMGVQczU2Tm1XVnlGOW04ODdqekd1M3NuNEZSQlJhRjh2ZmZOTGV3Y0hHWmJfaVUySXFiM09nWjRBMDNCU3RNcTQwdXJDdDZUVXg1N9IBWkFVX3lxTFBuU3EzX0xXc3Q2WE9wUGQyT0IwRDM0VTlkelkxRmU2WG1Pang0WXRYSlU0Y1hUQmNEcW83cldxS1NXZ1RnTzlFR2wzckxIN2t2eWloX1dKNWlHUQ?oc=5,"Fri, 03 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Have the wheels come off for Tesla? Theo Leggett Business correspondent, BBC News Getty Images Last month Tesla had to recall thousands of its Cybertrucks over safety concerns around their accelerator pedals There was a time when it seemed Tesla could do no wrong.  In little more than a decade, it went from technology upstart to mass-market carmaker, invested billions in its clean energy business, and saw its value rocket. But now the company is struggling with falling car sales and intense competition from Chinese brands, as well as problems with its much-hyped  Cybertruck. Lower sales have hit its revenues, and hurt its profits. Its share price has fallen by more than a quarter since the start of the year.  So is all of this just a bump in the road, or are the wheels coming off the Tesla bandwagon? ""It's about breaking a spell,"" explained Elon Musk to a specially invited audience at Tesla's California factory back in June 2012. ""The world has been under the illusion that electric cars can't be as good as gasoline cars,"" he said. Musk was speaking at the launch of the new Tesla Model S, a car he insisted would shatter that illusion. It was no empty promise.  Getty Images Tesla's 2012 release of the Model S transformed the electric car market At the time electric cars had a long-standing reputation for being slow, uninspiring and impractical, with very limited range. Although new models such as the Nissan Leaf were starting to develop a niche following, they had yet to make much of an impact on the wider market. The Model S was powerful, had sportscar performance, and could travel up to 265 miles on a single charge. It wasn't cheap, starting at $57,000 (£47,000) in the US for the lowest performance version, but it certainly made a point. Since then, Tesla has launched four more models, including the Model X SUV, the ""affordable"" Model 3 and Model Y, and the Cybertruck.  It now has huge, so-called gigafactories building cars in Shanghai and Berlin, in addition to its original facility in Fremont, California, and a number of other US sites. Last year, it delivered 1.8 million cars, suggesting it has established itself firmly as a mass-market manufacturer.  But according to Professor Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, that is part of the problem. ""When Tesla first emerged, it had an exciting new product, a charismatic CEO, and it came across as really pioneering,"" he explains. Now though, the company ""is no longer the entrepreneurial new entrant and upstart disrupter, but increasingly an industry incumbent with all the challenges this brings when faced with a growing array of competitors in the same market space"". Other companies, like China's Nio, are offering more exciting products, says Prof Wells, while fellow Chinese firm BYD offers good performance at lower prices. ""Basically, the world has caught up with Tesla,"" he says. Getty Images Chinese electric car brand Nio is making cars with the wow factor There is no doubt that there is a lot more competition than there used to be. Following the diesel emissions scandal that engulfed it in 2015, Volkswagen began ploughing money into electric vehicles.  And as governments around the world began looking seriously at eventual bans on the sale of new petrol and diesel models, other established manufacturers soon followed. Customers looking for an electric car with decent range and performance now have plenty of options to choose from.  In China, meanwhile, policymakers have for years seen the development of electric vehicles (EVs) as an opportunity to take a significant share of the global market, and promoted their development. The result has been the rapid growth of brands such as BYD. It overtook Tesla to become the world's biggest manufacturer of electric cars at the end of 2023, although a subsequent drop in sales allowed Tesla to regain its crown in the first three months of this year. At the same time, as the EV market has become more established, in many parts of the world subsidies to help consumers buy them have been reined in. That may be one reason why the rampant growth in EV sales in recent years has eased off - and why the manufacturers themselves are having to drop their prices. According to independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt, this has certainly had an impact on Tesla. ""Finance ministers who were previously happy to offer attractive incentives for the purchase of a battery electric vehicle in a market environment that appeared bare-shelved, with essentially a Tesla or a Tesla on offer, are now slamming their purses shut,"" he says.  One market in which this appears to have had a profound effect is Germany. A subsidy scheme offering thousands of euros off the cost of a new electric vehicle was abruptly ended in December.  EV sales there fell sharply in the first three months of this year, with Tesla suffering a 36% drop compared to the same period in 2023. The question now is whether Tesla can regain lost momentum. Its maverick chief executive, Elon Musk appears to be pinning his hopes on the company becoming a leader in vehicle autonomy - a provider of driverless robot taxis. Last month, on his social media site X, he wrote: ""Not quite betting the company, but going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move. Everything else is like variations on a horse carriage"". Getty Images Elon Musk is betting on Tesla being the leader in driverless cars Yet Musk has been talking up the prospect of full autonomy a very long time. In 2019, for example, he promised that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. The reality, so far, is rather different. Tesla's ""Full Self Driving"" package remains rather less than its title suggests - it is still a ""hands on"" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times. The quest for full autonomy does fit with Tesla's identity as a technology business, rather than a traditional carmaker. But Musk's critics believe it is simply a smokescreen to distract from other problems. Meanwhile, Tesla has been cutting prices to boost sales, and cutting costs and reducing headcount to improve its margins.  Much as any other car company might do."
Tesla’s plans in Mexico are not dead. They’ve just lost steam - EL PAÍS English,https://news.google.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?oc=5,"Mon, 06 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Eduardo Aguilar has a front-row seat to Mexico’s most talked-about investment. The university professor drives by the plot of land bought  by Tesla  to build a “gigafactory” in Santa Catarina, in the state of Nuevo León, daily on his way to work. Contrary to rumors that plans announced by one of the most valuable companies in the world are dead, and despite the fact that little has been done since its announcement a year ago, Aguilar is certain the project is happening. “The land is the same as it was a year ago, no doubt about that, but all the government works around what will be the plant have already begun,” says the academic, who teaches economic policy at the University of Monterrey (Udem). The campus is located around 18 miles from the Tesla location. “The machinery and signage show that the entrance expansion and stormwater infrastructure that the state had promised have already begun,” he adds. Unlike many in Nuevo León, Aguilar opposes the popular project for environmental reasons (the state suffers from water shortages, high pollution and road congestion), but those are not the reasons why the project, which was promoted as the investment of the year, has lost steam. Much has changed at Tesla since its CEO, the  unpredictable and “fickle” Elon Musk , announced the $4.5 billion investment in March of last year. In January,  China’s BYD overtook Tesla  as the world’s leading electric vehicle (EV) maker, offering cheaper cars. In addition, the profit margins of Musk’s company have been sharply reduced since the sales boom it experienced in 2021. In the last year, the EV market has slowed and last month, the company reported its lowest quarterly sales since 2022 and its first annual drop since 2020. Tesla announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce and even the job offers it had in Nuevo León disappeared from its webpage. A BYD car showroom in Perisur, one of Mexico City's main shopping centers, in October 2023. Mariceu Erthal (Bloomberg) The story of the Tesla investment that is yet to happen (and that, many speculate, will not) runs parallel to the failure of the governor of Nuevo León, Samuel García, to deliver the incentives that he promised Musk. The billboards that tower over highways in the northern city with the Tesla logo are a reminder of how García managed, briefly, to ride the wave of inertia generated by the announcement of the investment to make a run for the presidency. This did not last long, as García was unable to negotiate his replacement as governor with the opposition in Congress. He was also unable to convince the Federation to send resources for the works promised to Tesla. Nearshoring Since Tesla’s big factory announcement, other companies have said they’re investing in Mexico, though without making a big splash. In June, the Argentine steel company Ternium announced that it would invest $3.2 billion in the same state. Another Argentine company, the e-commerce giant Mercado Libre, has an investment of $2.45 billion in Mexico for this year. And in February, Amazon announced a $5 billion investment, larger than Tesla’s, through its cloud services subsidiary AWS. What brings these companies to Mexico is the ongoing  economic tensions between the United States and China . Companies that want to continue selling to the North American country are looking to exit the Asian country and relocate in countries considered “allies” to the U.S., and few countries are better positioned than Mexico. The biggest winners have been the northern and central states, better placed to receive companies, which is why President Andrés Manuel López Obrador fought to bring the Tesla plant, which was supposed to assemble the firm’s cheapest model,  to southern Mexico  instead. López Obrador during a meeting with Tesla executives at the National Palace, on March 8, 2023. Presidencia Perhaps indirectly, Tesla imposed its conditions by not being willing to move the plant to the south of the country as the federal government wanted, says Matías Gómez Leautaud, analyst for Eurasia Group in Mexico City. “This most likely caused a sting within the López Obrador Administration, which responded with ‘okay, go where you wish, but you’re on your own.’” Record spending Governor García found the resources to start the works that are already being carried out near Tesla’s land in Santa Catarina, but now, it’s the company that does not have the cash flow it had a year ago. “In the most recent quarter, they burnt through $2.5 billion in free cash flow, an all-time record high burn of cash”, says Gordon Johnson, market strategist and founder of GJL Research in New York. Johnson is famous in Wall Street circles for his skepticism toward Tesla and Musk. He has studied the company’s financials and issued bearish recommendations for Tesla shares since 2018 and, in his estimates, the true value of one share of the automaker is close to $22. The stock is currently trading at $180. In other words, Johnson and his team believe Tesla stock is 90% overvalued. The announcement of the plant in Mexico was made in March 2023, at a time when Tesla’s stock was falling, and Johnson believes that Musk went ahead to announce the project without having a concrete plan in the hopes that it would boost the stock. “That didn’t happen”, Johnson says, “so how in the heck are you going to build a bigger factory when you can’t even sell what you’re already producing?” Gordon Johnson in New York, in 2017. Christopher Goodney (Bloomberg) According to the analyst, Tesla has sold fewer cars than it has produced in seven of the last eight quarters, meaning they are selling only 75% of their inventory. Also, the competitive advantages the company had during its boom in 2021, such as the ability to produce faster than its competitors, have faded now that the auto market has stabilized after the pandemic. And, as if that were not enough, BYD has become a global EV giant in the last year. Gómez Leautaud agrees. “There is a scenario in which, even if they build everything Musk wants, the plan could have been halted for multiple reasons”, he says. “He is known to be a very fickle businessman and the company is not going through its best months. Although there is an obvious responsibility on the part of the state government in that they have yet to deliver what they had committed to delivering, I think it is beyond them.” ‘Unsustainable’ investment Compelling reasons remain for Musk to continue with his Mexico plans, although the company’s lack of communication on the subject is fueling speculation of its cancellation. For Aguilar, the Udem professor, even if Tesla abandons the project, someone else would take his place. “The fact that they’re building all this infrastructure for the factory and that the government has given in to all the demands that Tesla made, that is an opportunity served on a silver platter for any foreign capital,” says Aguilar. If the federal government adopts a colder attitude towards investment, states like Nuevo León could be more proactive to take advantage of the moment. In fact, Nuevo León is the State that is receiving the most foreign investment. The property acquired by Tesla in Nuevo León, on March 3, 2023. DANIEL BECERRIL (REUTERS) “There is constant promotion to attract more and more and more investment, without acknowledging or prioritizing the biotic conditions of the metropolitan area, such as the water crisis, greater greenhouse gas emissions and greater road congestion,” the academic says. “Direct foreign investment under current conditions is totally unsustainable and that is not being said,” he concludes.

Tesla fires team expanding Supercharger network. Expert explains why it was a good move for Elon Musk — and consumers - Northeastern Global News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPZzVQamRWX3hlS3ZhYVBrMzloRUxMSjRmTl9Xcy1XZjMtOFN6MUY3NjZaZExfNUJGanZrOEtzbWhsazNCSUJydHRZU3p0Qjc1eEVBQ21ITmIzR2wzZ1Q0amFCQjJYZWZySWw3VW1pOHU4NTFfakpVQ0Y2RVFLUUpyaEVn?oc=5,"Tue, 07 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Last week, Tesla  fired 500 employees  responsible for expanding its Supercharger network.    The layoffs caught many by surprise, considering Tesla’s Supercharger network is  dominant in the United States ,  often the only chargers in many regions . In addition, the company had  recently signed deals to allow other car makers to use the network .   But Northeastern University business professor Fernando Suarez says that the decision — although “complex” — makes sense.    “At the end of the day, I can see how — from the perspective of Tesla — you would make a decision like this,” says Suarez, the Jean C. Tempel professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Northeastern. Suarez also lectures about Tesla in an Innovation Driven Strategy course at the university.     “Yes, they could make some money out of the charging of other cars on their network,” Suarez continues. “But at the same time, they’re giving oxygen to the competition and allowing them to get stronger and stronger.”     03/26/18 – BOSTON, MA. – Fernando Suarez, Jean C. Tempel Professor, Entrepreneurship and Innovation; Entrepreneurship and Innovation Group Coordinator, Research poses for a portrait on March 26, 2018. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University   Fernando Suarez, the Jean C. Tempel professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Northeastern, says Tesla’s decision “makes sense” for the car company. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University   And while the decision  leaves many drivers worrying about how and where  they are going to charge their electric vehicles, Suarez believes consumers will ultimately benefit from Tesla’s move.     “In the long term, it means that there will be more competition,” Suarez says. “It will incentivize other networks to grow faster, and other companies to start investing in their Supercharger network and in competing supercharging networks to be built.”   The Tesla Supercharger network is the dominant fast-charging network in the United States, with roughly 6,000 station locations and about 28,000 charging ports. Elon Musk said the firings included the group that had worked on building new Supercharger stations. Tesla, he said, would finish stations under construction. ChargePoint has the largest charging network in the United States with over 27,000 stations with nearly 50,000 individual charging ports, but the majority of these are slow-charging stations.          Northeastern Global News, in your inbox.   Sign up for NGN’s daily newsletter for news, discovery and analysis from around the world.         The Supercharger network was for years proprietary, meaning only Tesla cars could use it.    But Suarez says a few recent developments have made the idea of continuing to build and grow a nationwide charging network less attractive to Tesla.   First, the electric vehicle market “matured” — Tesla is no longer the only player in the game.   “Tesla enjoyed a situation that was very unusual — they were basically left alone for 10 years,” Suarez says. “When competition came, as in the last year when Tesla had  to slash prices , sales  were down ,  10% of its workforce was laid off ,  and its stock fell , you transition to a different state in the industry — a state in which efficiency is super important.”   In other words, Tesla needs to cut costs.   But in addition to efficiency, a more mature market also involves standardization.    Perhaps foreseeing this, Tesla forged deals with other automakers to allow non-Tesla cars to use the Supercharger network with adapters. But it would cost money for Tesla to adjust, maintain and expand its charging network — costs that might outweigh the money Tesla could make from charging customers. It also would give its competitors a leg up if they didn’t have to devote money to building their own charging networks.   Plus, this was only going to work for so long — the EV charging market is maturing too.    In fact, in last year’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, the government set EV charging standards and required companies to abide by them in order to access $2.5 billion in  federal grants to build out the EV charging network .    Ultimately, facing a cash crunch, a standardized mature market for EVs and a maturing market for EV chargers, Tesla had a decision to make, Suarez says — essentially, did it want to be a car company or a charger company?   Tesla appears to have  chosen the former, betting on autonomous vehicles for its next market disruption.   Of course, for the EV driver, Tesla’s decision is disconcerting; probably also for the environmentalist.    “From the societal point of view, maybe this is actually not a good thing because it will delay the deployment of the EV industry and the progress of the industry in the U.S.,” Suarez says. “But that would be temporary.”   Will others fill the vacuum?     “No question,” Suarez says."
Tesla’s Semi Leader Takes Center Stage at ACT Expo - act-news.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNRWp4NTZIZnFqY25zSW9MdlRIUTV3aVpuWG9kaGplekUyWFJoSDFKS2VTc095OVFtUWE4NjZ3V0RaNmhITlBVMGVxaXZpckw4YjAyVU9UOENfMDJSbkQ4Z2N6TVRza3NXeU9IbmdhR3AtdG5UMnU4clM0OUFHTUJ0NkY0cUxrbDQ?oc=5,"Mon, 20 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","As GNA (a TRC Company) President Erik Neandross pointed out in his introduction, Tesla agreed to address the ACT Expo audience for the first time this year, sending along Dan Priestley, the Semi program’s senior manager.   “I’m excited to be here to share an update on Tesla semi thus far, and shed just a little bit of light of what our next steps are,” began Priestley, who then acknowledged the respect he has for the commercial transportation sector. “You represent all of the people and companies behind the scenes that are moving the majority of goods in North America.”   Since its unveiling in 2017, the Tesla Semi has seen its share of delays, something that Priestley did not shy away from.   “Now, I know, as alluded to, there’s been some questions on timing. But Tesla has a specialty and that is turning the impossible into merely late,” joked Priestley. “I think that there are some narratives that seem to think that electric heavy trucking is still impossible. You might hear someone say that it’s really hard. Well, guess what, it is really hard. We’ve been doing it, but it is absolutely worth doing, and we do not enter this industry lightly.”   Alluding to the need for freight companies to maximize payload when transporting goods, Priestley explained that achieving strong range-to-mass ratios is only possible with “a dedicated purpose-built, ground-up electric platform,” something the electric vehicle manufacturer has past experience with.   “There’s no wasted space. The powertrain and the vehicle work hand in hand. We saw this on the light-duty side and we’re seeing it all over again on the heavy-duty side,” said Priestley.   The other sticking point for many fleets, charging time, was also addressed, with the Semi program manager pointing to the fact that Tesla can offer megawatt level fast charging that is reliable and safe. Tesla has already deployed this in the field and is actively using it in vehicle testing and with customers.   “What this does is it unlocks the operational equivalence between diesel and electric,” added Priestley. “There’s none of these ratios that you need extra electric trucks do the same amount of work that diesels do. They can swap one for one in operations.”   For example, PepsiCo ran  more than 1,000 miles  with one of its three Tesla Semis in a 24-hour period during NCAFE’s Run on Less Electric demonstration last year, with the other two totaling 754 and 808 miles, respectively. Tesla is also “putting our money where our mouth is,” introducing the Semi into its own supply chain and operations by hauling battery packs from its Gigafactory in Nevada down to support its Fremont factory operations in California.   “Two years ago, this route was 100% diesel – we are now electrifying it,” said Priestley. “We are able to do this because the truck has adequate range, proper infrastructure to pair with it, and the vehicle mass allows for one-for-one payload parity. But you get all of this at a lower operating cost. That is the beauty of electric heavy trucking.”   Currently, the Semi fleet is seeing an average of 1.7 kilowatt hours per mile, according to Priestley, and this is with larger payloads than some would expect. For example, PepsiCo has been using its Semis to haul beverages, much heavier goods than its chips and other snacks. They have seen so much success that Tesla is in the process of delivering 50 more Semis to its Fresno, California, facility, as well as the mega charging to support it. The increasing delivery of and orders for the Semi will be supported by a factory that is currently being built in Nevada that will eventually produce 50,000 units annually.   Priestley then went on to address another elephant in the room, the Supercharger network. At the end of April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk  laid off the team  responsible for building EV charging stations. The car manufacturer then  rehired some of the team  back a few weeks later.   “To be very clear, charging is core to Tesla. This year, we are investing more than $500 million in new supercharger stations, expanding the network. We are committed to providing our customers with a great supercharging experience and we’re going to extend that exact same train of thought into the heavy-duty side as well. We’re going to make sure that every vehicle we deliver has a charging solution supported that could come in a variety of flavors,” said Priestley.   After the presentation, Neandross joined Priestley for a fireside chat style discussion on all the points he discussed. Pointing to the fact that historically Tesla restricts the information shared with the media, Neandross asked what changed.   “When we first unveiled this product in 2017, Tesla was a fraction of the company that it is today. We had just launched Model 3; we were in the ramp of that production, Model S and X as well,” said Priestley. “We now have the fast-charging infrastructure to talk about, we have launched an enormous and very successful energy storage business. All of that effort like that has really been emblematic of Tesla’s overall growth and maturity. And I think that now, that everything that was done over that time period to build that business, has actually put us in a much better position to serve this industry better.”   Next up, Neandross addressed the vehicle testing for the Semi, and what other real-world conditions the electric truck had seen. In terms of cold weather testing, the Semi made a trip to Alaska last winter, to see how it would handle in extreme cold weather condition, running it on public road ran at minus 35 degrees Fahrenheit.   “We really spent a lot of time in the cold because we really understand the need to stretch the vehicle across all the various operating conditions,” said Priestley, adding that his team spent time in and around the Las Vegas and Death Valley area to test it in extreme heat conditions, with temperatures of 115-120 degrees Fahrenheit. “We really liked to push the vehicle to its absolute limit, and it sweated, but it did really well.”   The Tesla Semi will be on display at this year’s Ride and Drive for ACT Expo attendees to experience."

Or, rather, a friend of mine bought a Tesla Cybertruck in 2019, and, this week, he finally had it delivered. Despite myself, I’m a fan.   Is it ostentatious? Yes. It is bizarre? No doubt. But it’s undeniably cool nevertheless, and you can tell as much by the lines of people who stare at it wherever he goes. Last night, when my friend took me out for a drive in it, people’s jaws dropped as it went past, and one guy — who couldn’t have been under 70 — was so taken that he maneuvered himself unsubtly into a position on the sidewalk from which he could take a quick selfie.   The Cybertruck is odd. It is also almost impossibly futuristic. Other than the original Delorean from which it clearly takes its inspiration, there is nothing even remotely like it on the road — or off the road. When you see it surrounded by other cars, you feel as if you’ve been warped to another planet. Watching it move around my suburban street was utterly surreal. I’m no car expert, but I suspect there has never before been a commercial vehicle that is quite this jarringly unusual. A common criticism of modern cars is that they all look the same. Well, this one doesn’t.   A few weeks ago, I wrote  a criticism of electric cars  — specifically, it was against federal mandates of electric cars, but I was also pretty disparaging of electric cars in general. I stand by that piece, but, having played with the Cybertruck, I’ll concede this much: The problem I identified with the lack of noise has been fixed in this one case. Instead of that antiseptic silence you get in most Teslas and Polestars and the like, the Cybertruck makes this delightfully audible Jetsons-like “whirrrr” sound when you accelerate. It’s not loud or throaty like a Porsche or a Ferrari, but, within its own context, it works perfectly nicely, and, more important still, it provides the physical feedback that is so important when driving.   I don’t want one. I’m not just saying that: I really don’t. But I do think that it’s important to give credit where it’s due, and if the aim of the Cybertruck was to make people of all ages stare and say, “my goodness me, what was  that ?” then its designers have succeeded spectacularly. Bravo."

Well, if you’re anything like me, you answer, “heck yah!” That being said, if you follow along on the First Drive / Driven reviews that I’ve done in the past, you may have noticed I’m kind of picky about what I test drive. I don’t want to test drive cars just because they are new or just because it’s a job or just because they are from a certain manufacturer. I want to test drive a car because it has a  WOW  factor. I’m the girl that they made the saying, ‘ life is too short to drive boring cars’  for. And while a regular ol’, run-of-the-mill EV isn’t necessarily “my thing”, the Cybertruck hits different. I’m not sure if it is because it is zombie attack-proof or its Mad Max-vibe; but in either case, it has  WOW  written all over it and after seeing the reaction it had rolling through the city, it is obvious that I’m not the only one that thinks so.   I’ve driven a lot of cars, and even owned a few that are the kind of cars that people want to take pictures of. The kind that gets videoed as you speed down the Interstate or sit at a stoplight, the kind people pose next to for impromptu Instagram moments, the kind that everyone that knows you, knows where you’ve been because they see your car and text you photos with the words, “I saw you at….

Ten minutes later, your boss will text, ""Is that you on South Street? I thought you were working today.""                              Gawking and gathering aside, here is what it is like driving the  2024 Tesla Cybertruck AWD Dual Motor Foundation Series :         This Tesla Cybertruck was test driven over the course of a single day with absolutely no incentive to gauge my opinion in any direction. For detailed insight into testing procedures and data collection, please review our  methodology policy.                                2024 Tesla Cybertruck Sighting Confirmed                   My time behind the wheel of the  2024 Tesla Cybertruck was spent in the Silicon Valley . As the center of innovation, California’s Silicon Valley seemed fitting for the revolutionary vehicle, and I use the term “fitting” loosely, because where the hell, in this day and time does a three-ton, radically futuristic, post-apocalyptic, people-moving machine fit into aesthetically? A moon landing would be my best guest, but since that wasn’t an option – Silicon Valley would have to do.                Cybertruck First Impression: See It To Believe It                            Jody Only          My mission was set. Pick up the Cybertruck to determine if the newest Tesla creation can live up to the hype. It was the only one on the lot when I arrived. It couldn’t have been missed. It was an undeniable, giant steel ‘wedge on the edge’ with the sunlight reflecting off its body panels like a beacon to announce its presence. It struck me more like a permanent industrial structure than a four-wheeled, moving vehicle. First Impression: Hmmm… that giant hunk of metal can pull off a zero to 60 in 4.1 seconds? I will believe it when I see it.                Cybertruck Dimensions                  Weight       6,603 Lbs           Overall Width (Folded Mirrors)       86.6 Inches           Overall Width (Extended Mirrors)       95 Inches           Overall Height       70.5 Inches           Overall Length       223.7 Inches           Cargo       120.9 Cubic-Feet           Wheels       20 Inch           Seating       5 Adults           Ground Clearance (Extract Mode)       16 Inches                   Related     There aren't any 6x6 EV trucks out (yet), but here's one truck that would surely look the part with an extra axle at the rear.                                     Cybertruck Driven: Performance                                       Jody Only          Back to that first impression. Did that  giant hunk of metal pull off a zero to 60 in 4.1 seconds ? Yes, the Cybertruck could put it down. I saw it, so I believe it. By my own calculations, my test time was technically 4.5 seconds, but I will give that .4-second difference the benefit of the doubt against road conditions and my own acclimation. But let’s start at the beginning.                A Touchpad is Used To Open The Tesla Cybertruck Doors                            Jody Only          The Cybertruck’s seamless, cold rolled steel exterior has no door handles, or bolt holes at all for that matter. Even the side mirrors are affixed above the steel and the bushwhackers are sans that typically aggressive adhering hardware. To gain entrance into the Tesla vehicle, there is a touchpad for the front door that spans the base width of Cybertruck’s B-pillar and a smaller one for the rear door that spans the width of the C-pillar. A light touch will cause the door to pop open a couple of inches, allowing it to be grasped and opened to a full 90-degrees for entry or loading.                There Is More Than One Way To ""Start"" The Cybertruck                            Jody Only          No key, no fob, no problem. The Cybertruck can be started by detection of a “phone key” on the Tesla app when the driver depresses the brake pedal. This means the app must be on a device, signed in, and paired to the vehicle. The device must be charged and Bluetooth enabled. The Cybertruck can also be started with a card key which must be tapped inside the cabin, similar to a tap-to-pay credit card reader, and then the correct pin must be entered on a keypad that appears on the Tesla infotainment screen.   Once I got in and got it started, it was time to launch Elon’s production model spaceship; but then I thought, “wait, I started it, but was it running? Now if you’ve driven an EV anything, this has probably crossed your mind. Flashba"

The Tesla saga is getting weirder by the minute. First we learned the company was terminating 10% (or more) of its global workforce. Then we learned that Tesla really  isn’t a car company at all . Rather it is an AI and autonomous driving company. Next we learned the entire  Supercharger team  has been terminated. Today there are reports the company is pulling way back on its plans to use  high pressure casting  to build its cars after years of telling us the opposite. Three years ago, Tesla had achieved a cult-like status among its customers. But today? Well, that is the focus of the following disquisition.   In the 1980s, the CEO of General Motors, Roger Smith, became the reluctant co-star of Michael Moore’s  Roger And Me . The film chronicled how Smith closed a number of GM factories in order to boost the company’s bottom lime but at the expense of many assembly line workers who lost their jobs as a result. Smith was not a lovable man, by most accounts, but he was distressed that no American manufacturer could build a quality car at a price most people could afford. He was tired of seeing all the Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas on the road but few counterparts from American companies.   One day, Smith shocked the GM board by announcing the company would create a new division — Saturn — and fund it with an initial investment of $5 billion, which was a lot of money in the mid-80s. The heads of the other GM divisions were less than thrilled by the idea. Chevrolet and Pontiac in particular took umbrage at the proposal, thinking that every Saturn sold would come at the expense of models in their own product lineup. But Smith was adamant and soon construction began on a new factory nestled in the rolling foothills near Spring Hill, Tennessee.   The name of the new division was taken from the Saturn V rockets that propelled the US space program, not the planet. That’s the reason the name of the new division was written in NASA script and not Times New Roman. A slew of talented engineers from Oldsmobile signed on to the Saturn project and moved to Tennessee to be part of it. They invented lost foam casting techniques that had previously been reserved for custom casting jobs. They created a transmission that could be either manual or automatic and built on the same assembly line. They devised a way to push concrete through a conventional paving machine for the parking lots around the factory.   Saturn & Innovation   There were lots of innovations in management at well. The UAW contract was only about twenty pages long. Grievance procedures were streamlined. There was no executive dining room — everyone ate the same food in the same facility — and workers were expected to clean and maintain their work area themselves. The assembly line featured a palett system that workers could raise or lower to fit their physical attributes. One team of workers traveled the entire length of the factory on one palett to build each car so they could feel like they were part of a team and not just a human cog in a giant machine.   The sales process was unique in American history. All the showrooms were light gray with red accents (a theme later adopted by Toyota) and all the sales desks were open to the showroom. Managers’ offices were all glass. The sales staff was trained to focus on helping customers to make good buying decisions based on their needs. Every new customer was treated to a tour of the service facility, which was calm, organized, and clean.   I myself applied for a sales position, but with great trepidation. “Car salesman” is not a term that generally gets great respect in the community. As I sat patiently outside the general manager’s office waiting for my interview, someone barged in to say a customer was unhappy about something and what should be done? The GM asked one question: “What’s the right thing to do for the customer?” After that I no longer feared being a car salesman, so long as I could do it a Saturn dealership.   Saturn grew by leaps and bounds. Dealerships had monthly or quarterly rallies for customers with bouncy houses and chili cook-offs. One day my store hired a monster truck to come crush an Oldsmobile. The kids loved it but the Olds dealer next door was not amused. Every year, the factory hosted a Homecoming event in Spring Hill and thousands of happy Saturn owners would trek from the far corners of America to attend the festivities.   The media started referring to Saturn as a cult and they weren’t entirely wrong. Saturn people couldn’t stop telling anyone who would listen how happy they were with their cars. All of this is not to say Saturns were perfect. They weren’t. They were built to sell at a certain price point and sell they did. The original car — the SL sedan — was deliberately designed to fit female customers. There was a rumor that “SL” stood for “Saturn for ladies” and that somewhat larger cars more dimensionally suited for men were on the drawing boards.   They never arrived. Roger Smith departed as the head of GM, and the heads of Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick got out the long knives and carved any new development funds for Saturn out of the budget. Saturn started selling rebadged Chevrolets and Opels. The focus on customer satisfaction withered and slowly but surely the brand died. The cult of Saturn was over.   Is The Cult Of Tesla Next?     George Santayana , whose real name was Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás, was a Harvard philosopher who is widely credited with being the first to say, “Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.” Elon Musk is an amazing person who has accomplished wonderful things. He did not invent the electric car, but he can rightfully be called the father of the EV revolution. Auto manufacturers all around  the globe are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into establishing battery supply chains and building factories to manufacture electric cars. The Chinese are the clear leaders in the field, but Korean, Japanese, and European car companies are not throwing in the towel, at least not yet.   Here’s the point of today’s screed — What happened to Saturn could happen to Tesla, and Musk seems completely oblivious to that possibility. Recently he said Tesla is not a car company. What? All these years it has been laser-focused on the car business and its shareholders have been wowed by visions of sugar plums dancing in their heads as they envisioned a company that would grow 50% a year — because that’s what Musk promised — and become the largest car company on Earth, cranking out 20 million new electric cars a year at factories all around the globe.   Now suddenly that dream is off the table and we are all supposed to pivot to Tesla being an AI and robotaxi company? C’mon, Elon. How stupid do you think we are? It seems more and more that Musk is just a huckster not unlike  PT Barnum , whose mantra was, “There’s a sucker born every minute.” The evidence is mounting that Musk is just another in a long line of tech entrepreneurs whose goal is to get rich quick by moving fast and breaking things. Others of that ilk are Travis Kalanick of Uber fame and Trevor Milton, who once rolled a fuel cell-powered Nikola Class 8 truck down an incline to fool people into thinking it was operational. To some, Tesla today is little more than a classic Wall Street pump and dump scheme.   Put A Real Person In Charge Of Tesla   A recent op-ed by Mack Hogan for  Inside EVs  advocates for putting an adult in charge of the car manufacturing side of Tesla. If Elon wants to pursue AI and robots, fine. Let him do it on his own time and with his own money. “The only person who consistently gets in Musk’s way is Musk himself,” Hogan writes.   “The man’s quick, gut-driven pivots don’t seem to work out well when the business is mature. He’s prodded every dial and button at X — née Twitter — and the result is clear: The website that once defined the online conversation is now a cesspool of spam and bigotry. It’s never had a worse relationship with its advertisers. And its CEO has never been so radioactive.   “And yet America can’t afford for the same fate to befall Tesla’s auto-making efforts. The company is just too important. Very few other automakers right now offer such a compelling slate of EVs backed by Silicon Valley-grade software, a dealer-free buyer experience and an internally built, reliable charging network. Tesla is not just important to the EV market; it is important to the US’ strategic geopolitical position. It is the only large scale EV manufacturer in the country that has global relevance, the chops to compete with Chinese EV manufacturers and an existing, satisfied EV customer base.   “It doesn’t need a disruptor in charge. It needs an executive.  One who executes . Someone who can helm a complicated, large organization while retaining the institutional knowledge and talent to keep its edge over the competition. It doesn’t need to solve autonomy to succeed. It does not need one big swing. It needs a million little decisions, made by a CEO that isn’t distracted by SpaceX, X, Dojo, autonomy, and anger over “the woke mind virus.”   Hogan suggests the company under the guidance or a seasoned professional leader (Herbert Diess?) could make cars that people want to buy by redesigning the Model S, switching the Model 3 over to an 800 volt architecture, and building out the V4 Supercharger network. “These projects all surely sound boring to Elon Musk. That’s exactly why he shouldn’t be in charge of them.” Hogan says.   The Takeaway   40 years ago, Saturn made cars that people wanted to buy and everyone thought the company was here to stay. They were wrong. I did a track day at Watkins Glen in a Saturn SC2 coupe many years ago. All weekend long I had st"

The issue at hand now is whether the automotive company did enough in response to the 2023 recalls by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada. The recalls were issued after several collisions resulting from  using Tesla’s proprietary Autopilot system .   Tesla’s Autopilot  — alongside systems like  Cadillac’s Super Cruise  and  Volvo’s Pilot Assist  — falls in the category of  partially automated systems . These systems can take control of the vehicle’s acceleration and lane position however, they require the human driver to stay vigilant.       NBC News covers the recall of two million Tesla vehicles in December 2023.     The recall issued on Dec. 12, 2023 affected over two million Tesla vehicles in North America. At the core of the recall were some of Autopilot’s features which, according to regulators, could have contributed to drivers misusing the system or failing to maintain continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operations.                Read more:        Tesla recalls over two million vehicles, but it needs to address confusing marketing           The Autopilot recall is not the most recent in Tesla’s history. In April, regulators issued a recall of nearly 4,000 Cybertrucks in the U.S. — the  design of the accelerator pedal causes it to get stuck when pressed, increasing the risk of collisions .   Recalls and investigations   On April 25, U.S. regulators announced that they have opened an investigation to  assess the outcomes of the 2023 recall . In particular, it was reported that the Autopilot system was involved in 20 crashes since the recall — this prompted the current investigation by the NHTSA’s  Office of Defects Investigation .   On the same day, the NHTSA reported opening another investigation, this time into the safety of  BlueCruise , Ford’s partially automated system. In the  report , the NHTSA writes that it will investigate two fatal incidents involving Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles that occurred  while the BlueCruise system was active .         Ford’s automated driving system, BlueCruise, was implicated in two fatal crashes involving Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric SUV.   (Shutterstock)       Expected accidents   Although the onslaught of safety investigations by U.S. and Canada regulators may seem sudden, experts have been expecting these accidents to occur for years. For decades, research in human-machine interaction has indicated that there are inherent risks to having humans and robots  share control of automated systems .    Unlike fully automated systems of everyday use — like elevators, whose safety has been long proven — current partially automated driving systems cannot operate on their own. Because of their inability to deal with the vast array of road, weather and traffic conditions that humans encounter daily, these systems require human drivers to stay alert at all times which  drivers may not be very good at .    This, combined with many of these  systems’ inability to accurately detect conditions like distraction and drowsiness , has contributed to the upward trend in collisions involving partially automated systems.   Protecting the public   In addition to the above actions by federal regulators in the U.S. and Canada, provincial and state governments alike have a role to play. They need to promote road safety and ensure that the general public does not serve as guinea pigs in the current autonomous vehicle experiment.    Earlier in April,  British Columbia prohibited the operation of highly automated systems on provincial roads . This ban only impacts the use of a limited set of vehicles with more advanced capabilities; however, it represents an important step towards regulating technology and ensuring that vehicles function safely."
What do Tesla’s recent woes mean for the competition? - Tech Brew,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPY1VpLURMZmYxajVFSGZSU2hXUFNrbHREQTJmazNLV2ZKMzI4M2NjQlpIcTROSVRKRnp1eUtJQVFkMU9aVjE5TzdHYzExbGZoVVlRMUU3VXM5eFBfZXp0azBsZ1VjOWN1dUItS2dVQkt5d0g4eFZvTEtWS0VMYTlyQm9ETTAzdE4zcFVSOEpzWnE1Nzcta0hYVGF3NWF2a1NBSzJkTmZRRFk?oc=5,"Thu, 30 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","This year started off on an inauspicious note for Tesla. The Elon Musk-led company  lost its title  as the world’s top EV seller to Chinese EV maker BYD. Then in Q1, Tesla reported its first YoY  sales decline  since 2020, as well as  drops  in  profit and revenue , amid waning EV demand and growing competition. The hits and perceived missteps kept coming:  Mass layoffs and executive resignations . The  rocky rollout  of the long-awaited Cybertruck. The revelation that the Department of Justice is  investigating  whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud related to the  company’s claims  about its self-driving vehicle tech, which is also  under scrutiny  from federal auto safety regulators. Musk disappointed Wall Street by  nixing  hotly anticipated plans for an affordable EV in favor of focusing on his  robotaxi ambitions . Tesla’s stock is down about 30% year to date. But perhaps most puzzling of all was the news in April that  Tesla had laid off  nearly all of its Supercharger team—500 employees who worked on the company’s industry-leading EV charging business. The move immediately halted work on numerous charging station projects—a sign of the cuts’ broader implications for the buildout of EV charging infrastructure across the country. (Tesla later  hired back some  of the employees.) Basically, it’s been a rough year for Tesla. The upshot, according to industry experts, is that competitors—from traditional automakers to EV startups to charging providers—now have a clear chance at stealing some of Tesla’s thunder. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Try and come for my market share “It’s an opportunity for their competitors to continue to claw away at Tesla’s market share,” K.C. Boyce, VP, automotive and mobility and energy for Escalent, told Tech Brew. He pointed to recent Escalent data indicating that while Tesla is still “very highly considered” by consumers who are likely to buy an EV for their next vehicle, there’s a big difference this year in how many other brands they’re also considering. “In previous years, it was often only Tesla or Tesla and one other brand that were being considered for an EV,” he said. “And this year it’s Tesla and, and, and…It’s a lot more competitive today than it was even last year.” Because consumers tend to favor brands they already recognize and trust, the opportunity may be most ripe for legacy automakers, he said. Boyce thinks it could be especially opportune for a pair of sister brands: “Hyundai and Kia are really well-positioned given the troubles at Tesla. They’ve kept their foot on the metaphorical gas as it relates to electric vehicles.” Keep up with the innovative tech transforming business Tech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech. There’s room for startups to grab some market share, too, but some experts told us it might be tougher for them because they’re facing challenges of their own. “As Elon Musk has pointed out many times,” John Tomlinson, director of research at M Science, said, “there’s very few auto companies that started up and survived over the past 100 years.” Supercharger slash After the Supercharger news sent shockwaves through the EV sector, Musk  said  that Tesla still plans to invest $500 million this year in expanding its charging network. Even so, experts say the cutbacks will have major implications for the rollout of federally funded charging station projects, the pace of EV adoption, and the process of giving other brands access to Tesla’s network now that many are switching to Tesla’s charging connector. Tesla operates the largest charging network in the US, with some 25,000 Superchargers. The company operates more than 60% of high-speed chargers across the country and,  per Reuters , is the largest recipient of payouts from a $5 billion pot of federal funding to support construction of new charging stations. Boyce predicted in  a LinkedIn post  that the layoffs would set off a wave of “serious buyers’ remorse (and frantic checking of contract terms)...at major OEMs” that had signed on to Tesla’s charging standard. He also wrote that he expects it to “delay Supercharger access for non-Tesla drivers that don’t currently have it.” Loren McDonald, CEO of research firm EVAdoption,  wrote  on LinkedIn that “a slowdown in Supercharger expansion could mean that the total number of new stations and ports opened in the US in 2024 and 2025 would see flat growth for three years.” “Fairly universally, people look at Superchargers as being the most available, the most convenient, and the fastest out there,” Boyce told Tech Brew. “It’s those perceptions that are influencing their decisions to buy or not buy an EV when they go to make their next vehicle purchase. So I think this move by Tesla really imperils overall EV growth, not just Tesla’s EV growth, because of those buyer perceptions and concerns.” This provides competing charging networks like Electrify America with  an opportunity  to “step up and fill the game,” Boyce said, but “whether they will or not is another question.”"

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)       [Stay on top of transportation news:  Get TTNews in your inbox .]   Tesla Inc. must face a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging that it misled consumers about its cars’ self-driving capabilities, a fresh setback for the electric car maker just as CEO Elon Musk has staked the company’s future on autonomy.       	  			               Tesla has been accused of overstating in 2016 that all its upcoming cars would have the “hardware needed for full self-driving capability” and would be able to drive themselves from Los Angeles to New York City by the end of 2017.        	  			               “If Tesla meant to convey that its hardware was sufficient to reach high or full automation,” the complaint “plainly alleges sufficient falsity,” U.S. District Judge Rita Lin wrote in an order May 15.        	       Musk declared in April that Tesla is “going balls to the wall for autonomy” while committing the car maker to a next-generation,  self-driving vehicle concept called the robotaxi . The billionaire entrepreneur has talked a big game about autonomy for over a decade and has persuaded customers to pay thousands of dollars for its Full Self-Driving feature. The name is a misnomer — FSD requires constant supervision and doesn’t render vehicles autonomous — but Musk has repeatedly predicted it’s on the verge of measuring up to the branding.       	  			                 RELATED:   Tesla Stock Leaps on Reports of Chinese Approval of FSD   Meanwhile, the company faces federal probes into whether defects in its Autopilot driver-assistance feature have contributed to fatal crashes, as well as regulatory investigations and lawsuits over claims that it has overhyped its progress toward hands-free driving. Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  opened a probe  into whether the EV maker’s recall of more than 2 million cars months earlier adequately addressed Autopilot safety risks.

He alleged that statements by Tesla and Musk led him to believe that his car would have self-driving technology within a “reasonably short period.” But by 2022, Tesla hadn’t produced “anything even remotely approaching a fully self-driving car,” according to his complaint.       	  			               LoSavio brought the complaint on behalf of anyone who bought or leased a new Tesla vehicle with Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD since 2016.        	  			               Without ruling on the merits of his claims, the judge said LoSavio sufficiently alleged certain 2016 statements were misleading, such as all “Tesla vehicles produced in our factory now have full self-driving hardware” and that the cars would be able to drive themselves across the country “by the end of next year without the need for a single touch.”       	  			               While Lin allowed some negligence and fraud claims to proceed, she dismissed other claims. Her ruling lets pretrial fact-finding move forward. A decision on whether the case qualifies for class-action status will come later.       	  			               Want more news?

Key features included a sophisticated battery system capable of rapid charging and a then-unique regenerative braking system to enhance its efficiency. The vehicle emphasized safety with rigorous battery safety tests and integrated fault protections.     When you climb into the seat of a high-performance car that costs six figures, you expect certain things: acceleration that pushes you back into the seat, top-end stereo equipment, road-hugging handling, the throaty roar of a powerful engine and a big budget for the high-octane gas needed to fuel it. Well, the Tesla Roadster has almost all of those aspects covered. It's fast, fancy, handles like a dream and goes like a rocket, but it's virtually silent and it'll never burn a single drop of  gasoline . Tesla's first production car is also the world's first high-performance electric car.   Unlike a traditional gasoline-powered car, the Tesla Roadster doesn't contain hundreds of moving parts. It's powered by just four main systems:     The  Energy Storage System (ESS) The  Power Electronics Module (PEM) An  electric motor A  sequential manual transmission                    				"" "" 			    											The Energy Storage System is located in the rear of the vehicle. 										  				Imag­e © 2006 Tesla Motors, Inc. A­ll rights reserved. 			       In place of an internal combustion engine, the Tesla Roadster sports a bank of batteries -- the  Energy Storage System (ESS) . In developing a power source befitting such a high-performance car, Tesla went with technology proven in the laptop computer field -- rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The Roadster contains 6,831 of them. They weigh about 1,000 pounds in total, and Tesla claims that they provide ""four to five times the energy-density stores of other batteries"" [ ref ]. The batteries fit into 11 sectors with 621 batteries each. A separate computer processor controls each sector to make sure all of the charging and discharging is handled smoothly.   The Power Electronics Module (PEM) is a power inverter and charging system that converts DC power to AC power using 72  insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) . This results in a marked increase in power output compared to first-generation electric cars. Under peak acceleration, the batteries can crank out 200 kW of energy -- enough to light 2,000 incandescent light bulbs.   In addition to controlling charge and discharge rates, the Power Electronics Module controls voltage levels, the motor's RPM (revolutions per minute),  torque  and the  regenerative braking system . This braking system captures the kinetic energy usually lost through braking and transfers it back into the ESS. The efficiency and integration of the battery, PEM and motor systems is between 85 and 95 percent, allowing the motor to put out up to 185 kW of power. Aluminum heat dissipation fins and a rear-mounted ventilation port keep the power transistors from overheating.

An electrician can install a recharging station in your garage. This 220-volt, 70-amp outlet allows for a full recharge in 3.5 hours from a completely dead battery. Tesla likens charging your car to charging your  cell phone ; you can plug it in at night and have a fully-charged car in the morning. There's also a mobile kit that allows recharging at any electrical outlet, no matter where you are. The length of time it takes to charge using the mobile kit depends on the outlet configuration that you're using (110-volt or 220-volt).   Although auto owners have been driving around for decades with tankfulls of volatile, flammable gasoline in their cars, having 1,000 pounds of batteries behind their head gives some people pause. The recent  recalls of lithium-ion batteries  used in laptop computers have increased those fears. Tesla has gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of the Roadster's energy system. First, the battery system was extensively ""catastrophe tested,"" which involved heating individual cells until they burst into flames. Each cell is isolated enough from adjacent cells to prevent any damage to them. If one cell overheats, it will not start a chain reaction explosion.   A host of sensors detects acceleration, deceleration, tilt, temperature and smoke. If one senses an abnormal event, like a crash, it immediately shuts down and disconnects the power system. Similar anti-fault protections and sensors are part of the charging system [ ref ]."

Indians who pre-ordered Teslas in 2016 are giving up and chasing refunds - Rest of World,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTE8tc3lsU1Y3Zk5HYUNrUkc2VUUzNXdlTzZuLWw3UzNrbU00MWxWZnY5RXFtWTA5YktHVXR3T3J1NHgyU2FGZDE4clF4bkx2bXZESkl0R2hsZG1wZXp4?oc=5,"Tue, 07 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","When Tesla allowed Indians to get their hands on its wildly popular electric cars for the first time, Vishal Gondal was among the first to grab the opportunity.   Within hours after the company opened its pre-booking portal for India in April 2016, Gondal, a fan of Elon Musk and Tesla, paid $1,000 (then 66,237 rupees)   to pre-book the Tesla Model 3. At the time, there was no clarity on what the car would eventually cost in India or when the company would start delivering the vehicle to the country. But Gondal, who had driven a Tesla in the U.S. earlier, was swept with excitement.   For almost seven years after that, Gondal, founder and CEO of health-tech startup GoQii, patiently waited for his Model 3. By 2023, when there was still no sign of the car, he decided to cancel his booking — and that was the start of another ordeal.   Gondal had to chase Tesla’s India executive over emails for six months before he received his refund in June 2023. “There was no communication, no emails. And even years later, there was no apology [from the company],” he told  Rest of World .   Tesla still does not sell its cars in India — the  third-largest auto market  in the world.   Several Indians who had bought into the Model 3 dream in 2016 have had an experience similar to that of Gondal. Some of them believe they won’t ever buy a Tesla now that there are other electric car models available in the country, while others want to wait until the company sets up a showroom and establishes robust post-sale services in India. Only a few Musk loyalists in India are still committed to what they believe is the best electric car.   “It would be stupid if I say I’ll do it again,” Amit Bhawani, YouTuber and founder of tech blog PhoneRadar, who had booked the Model 3 in 2016, told  Rest of World . “If I see a showroom in Hyderabad with a proper service center, then I might. I won’t trust [Musk] anymore.”   Bhawani’s pre-booking amount was refunded in February 2020 after his  YouTube video  about canceling his Tesla order garnered attention. He also posted about his ordeal with getting a refund in  a couple   of posts on X . “Someone just let me skip the whole queue and gave me the refund to make me silent,” he said. “I found that normal people who canceled were not given refunds, and only influencers or people with [a] blue tick those days were refunded.”   In 2016, Tesla’s move to open pre-bookings for the Model 3 in India was received with much excitement. Within hours, several prominent tech and business leaders in the country had booked a Tesla, and posted about it on  social media . Since then, Musk has set many dates for when the company will enter India: in the  summer of 2017 ,  sometime in 2019 , and  “as soon as humanly possible ” in mid-2023. The carmaker even  registered an Indian subsidiary  in Bengaluru in January 2021, but there is still no official channel to buy a Tesla car directly from the company in India.     Musk’s will-he-won’t-he relationship with India, in posts to X since 2017.     When Musk announced his plan to visit India earlier this year, many anticipated that Tesla would  finally start talking about manufacturing  in the country. However, just two days before the scheduled trip, Musk called it off, owing to “ very heavy Tesla obligations .” He  made it to neighboring China  just a week later.   “People who booked around eight years ago aren’t the ones to fret on [the] $1,000 amount,” Yugal Joshi, partner at global research firm   Everest Group, told  Rest of World . But delays in rumored investments — in manufacturing cars, in setting up a gigafactory — and the recent cancellation of Musk’s India trip coupled with his “closeness to China” are complicating matters in an already uncertain environment, he said. “It is hard to estimate the arrival of Tesla cars on Indian roads unless there is clarity on tariffs.”   Until a couple of years ago, Tesla’s website showed a cancellation button when a prospective buyer logged in. But that option was “taken away” and replaced with an email ID, according to Nikhil Chaudhary, co-founder of a 5-year-old online community called Tesla Club India.   Tesla Club India, which has more than 18,600 followers on X and hundreds of members on its WhatsApp group, routinely receives queries from people about how to cancel their bookings, Chaudhary told  Rest of World .   Some prospective buyers have been pushed to track down Tesla  employees on LinkedIn  to move their cancellations along.   Varun Krishnan, founder of tech blog FoneArena, claims to be the first person to book the Model 3 in India. He told  Rest of World  he got his $1,000 refund in January 2022, after months of following up with Tesla employees in Hong Kong and California.   Tesla’s refund, after adjusting for inflation, should  amount to $1,300 in 2024 . But the company continues to refund $1,000.   “We joke about how much that $1,000 would’ve been worth had we invested in Tesla stock instead,” said Gondal, who now drives the Audi e-tron. In April 2016, Tesla’s share was priced $16 apiece. It now trades at around $160.   Owning a Tesla makes you look cool and stand out. People with money can spend a fortune just for these two aspects.   For years, Tesla’s pain point in India has been the  exorbitant import duty , which nearly doubles the price of the cars. On March 15, the Indian government  proposed a reduced import duty  of 15% on cars costing $35,000 at 8,000 units a year, as long as manufacturers set up local production within three years.   According to a   Financial Times  report , Tesla is sending U.S. employees to scout a location to set up a gigafactory in India worth up to $3 billion.  Rest of World  reached out to Tesla’s press email as well as an India sales manager, Ankit Kesarwani, but did not receive a response.   Tesla is “looking for a liberalized duty regime as well because it’s a huge undertaking they’re doing,” Mahesh Murthy, founder of venture capital fund Seedfund and digital marketing firm Pinstorm, told  Rest of World . Murthy pre-booked two Model 3 cars in 2016 and has not sought a refund, as he believes that Tesla is bullish on India but the circumstances haven’t so far aligned.   According to Murthy, there’s been “intense lobbying” by members of the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers , an association of domestic vehicle makers, to keep Tesla out. SIAM did not respond to  Rest of World ’s requests for comment at the time of publishing.   Ankur Bisen, senior partner at consulting firm Technopak, told  Rest of World  that Tesla’s standing in the Indian EV ecosystem is not the same as eight years ago because there are multiple viable options in the market now.   “2016 was a very different time, a different era as far as EV maturity is concerned. Beyond Tesla, we didn’t know anything about the EV space, right?” he said. “But today … the [Indian] government itself has come out with an EV report; there’s a lot of focus on two-wheeler EVs; Tata has taken a very bold stance on EVs and so have other auto manufacturers.”    According to Everest Group’s Joshi, Indians’ obsession with Tesla aligns with the global trend. Tesla “was ahead of its peers with its minimalist design, features, technology adoption, and focus on driving experience,” he said. “Owning a Tesla makes you look cool and stand out. People with money can spend a fortune just for these two aspects.”   Fans argue that Tesla has better range than most electric vehicles. German-made EVs from the likes of Audi and BMW, according to Arun Bhat, another co-founder of Tesla Club India, are internal combustion engine vehicles converted into EVs. “Luxury for me doesn’t only mean leather seats. [Tesla’s core technology] is leaps and bounds ahead of anything available in the market,” he told  Rest of World . Tesla’s over-the-air software updates make it worth the hype, according to the Tesla Club founders. “Tesla’s still updating the 2014 Model S … well past their warranty time,” Chaudhary  					  						said."

Within its portfolio, the  Tesla Model 3  sedan is priced similarly to the Model Y crossover. The Model 3 has been a popular mainstay and now, with the recent unveiling of the  Tesla Model 3 Performance , EV enthusiasts are enjoying the hype of a high-performance counterpart. In this comparison, we'll look at how the new Performance trim matches up against the regular Model 3 sedan in terms of design, features, performance, and pricing. Since no Tesla can be accused of being slow, is the Model 3 Performance really worth the extra outlay? Let's find out.         Related     The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N and Tesla Model 3 Performance are democratizing power and proving EVs can be fun to drive.                                    Model 3 vs. Model 3 Performance: Design                   The standard Tesla Model 3 boasts a sleek and minimalist design, embodying Tesla's signature aesthetic. Its clean lines and large uninterrupted surface panels exude a modern elegance that has captivated drivers worldwide. In contrast, the Model 3 Performance takes the design to the next level with subtle yet distinctive augmentations. Sporting a new body kit, larger wheels, and Performance badging, it exudes an aura of athleticism and aggression. While both models share the same fundamental design language, the Performance variant adds a touch of flair for those seeking a more dynamic appearance. The standard Model 3 has 18-inch Photon wheels or optional 19s, whereas the Performance ships with more stylish 20-inch forged 'Warp' wheels.   The new Model 3 Performance body kit features sporty front and rear fascias along with a spoiler, front splitter, and rear diffuser. These new design enhancements go beyond mere esthetics and were specifically engineered to improve the vehicle's aerodynamic performance from nose to tail.   According to Tesla, the integration of these design elements yields several significant benefits for this new generation Model 3 Performance, in comparison to the previous one:                                              A potential reduction of up to 5% in drag                                                                     A notable 36% decrease in lift                                                                     55% enhancement in front-to-rear lift balance                                                       Model 3 vs. Model 3 Performance: Performance                   When it comes to dynamic upgrades, the Model 3 Performance raises the bar. Specialized tires and an upgraded chassis enhance the vehicle’s performance capabilities, providing razor-sharp responsiveness and precision on the road. For enthusiasts craving the ultimate driving experience, the Model 3 Performance offers a blend of speed, power, and agility.   A blistering 0-60 mph time of just 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 163 mph are incredible performance figures for a sedan at the Performance's price point. Equipped with dual motors and boasting an impressive 510 horsepower and 547 lb-ft of torque, the Model 3 Performance delivers adrenaline-pumping acceleration and agile handling.   All that power doesn't mean much if the vehicle cannot effectively transfer it to the pavement. Tesla has equipped the Model 3 Performance with its latest generation Performance 4DU drive unit, which provides the following major advancements when compared to the previous Model 3 Performance drive unit:                                              22% increase in continuous power                                                                     32% more peak power                                                                     16% greater peak torque delivery                              These performance enhancements translate to improved and immediate acceleration.                Quick and Quicker: Model 3 0-60 MPH        In the realm of acceleration, both the standard Model 3 and the Model 3 Performance excel. However, the Performance variant takes the lead with its lightning-fast 0-60 mph time of 2.9 seconds, compared to the standard Model 3's still-impressive 4.2 seconds. Whether launching from a standstill or overtaking on the highway, the Model 3 Performance delivers instantaneous thrust that pushes the boundaries of electric performance.

A staggered wheel configuration has been implemented to optimize the higher torque output, limit traction control intervention, and provide a larger tire contact patch.   By incorporating a more robust rear tire, road comfort is increased through overall roll stiffness, reduced head-toss, and elevated comfort levels. Additionally, Tesla claims the new Pirelli P ZERO 4 tires boast lower rolling resistance, resulting in increased range capabilities.   Upgraded wheels and tires would not be effectively complete without upgraded brakes. The Model 3 Performance is equipped with larger brake rotors, dynamic calipers, and performance brake pads. This formula delivers quicker, more effective brake stopping power in line with the car's increased performance.                Chassis And Handling                            Tesla         Beyond straight-line speed, the Model 3 Performance promises to shine with improved sporty handling and agility thanks to its performance-tuned chassis. Both the Model 3 and Model 3 Performance sit on a new re-designed chassis platform that is feature-rich with custom-designed hardware aimed at enhancing performance and stiffness while minimizing weight.   Tesla has incorporated many advancements in Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) reduction and comfort upgrades. Unique to the Model 3 Performance is an adaptive damping system that can make real-time adjustments to inputs from the road and driver, thereby enhancing ride and handling. Three preset modes also distinguish the Model 3 Performance from lesser Model 3s:       Standard Mode:  Delivers a relaxed and calm driving experience with significant comfort enhancements and improved absorption, while still maintaining excellent control and engagement in various driving conditions.                              Sport Mode:  Enhances damping control for quicker settling times, resulting in heightened connection with the road during focused driving. This mode also improves steering response while remaining adaptable to rougher road surfaces.                              Track Mode:  Maximizes body control and response, with reduced adaptation to provide consistent high performance on closed circuits.                                           Range Comparison        Despite its focus on performance, the Model 3 Performance still has an acceptable range. With an estimated range of almost 300 miles on a single charge, it offers impressive long-distance capabilities without compromising on speed or power. The Model 3 Performance's range is better than the base RWD model but falls almost 50 miles short of the Model 3 Long Range.         Related     Cold weather is one of the major problems facing EVs, but there are a few tips to help you out.                                    Model 3 vs. Model 3 Performance: Interior                   Inside the cabin, both the standard Model 3 and the Performance variant offer a premium driving experience. Featuring Tesla's signature minimalist design, they boast spacious interiors, high-quality materials, and cutting-edge technology. However, the Performance model adds sportier accents such as carbon fiber trim and performance-oriented seating options, further emphasizing its dynamic personality. Whether cruising in comfort or pushing the limits on the track, the interior of the Model 3 Performance is designed to enhance the driving experience at every turn.   The Model 3 Performance equipped sport seats feature improved bolstering and a deeper, more engaging seating position, ensuring optimal comfort and support. The updated seating geometry and construction offer increased lateral support, making cornering and dynamic driving maneuvers more secure and enjoyable. Despite their sporty design, Tesla states these seats remain accessible and comfortable for everyday driving, striking a perfect balance between performance and convenience.         Related     Meanwhile, the Model 3 now can now be had for $500 less than a Model Y LR.                                    Model 3 vs. Model 3 Performance: Pricing                   When it comes to pricing, the Model 3 Performance commands a premium over its standard counterpart. With a starting price of $53,990 before incentives are taken into account, it's the most expensive Model 3.

It didn't take long to make an impression. The vehicle with Connecticut plates was first spotted by people on Main Street, where it was parked directly on a crosswalk in front of Congdon & Coleman. But that was just the beginning. A few hours later the truck reappeared, and this time it was stuck in the sand at Eel Point. The spectacle drew a small crowd before the $80,000 (starting price) vehicle was pulled out by the new ""I Pull Out Beach Towing"" service. The operator - whose identity is unknown - was described as ""super nice...Just a first-timer who made the standard mistakes."" Tesla was recently forced to recall nearly 4,000 Cybertrucks this week due to a defect with the accelerator causing it to get stuck when pressed, increasing the risk of crash. That covered all the Tesla Cybertrucks sold since the model went on sale last year,  according to USA Today . Could the truck's bizarre appearance Thursday on Nantucket been a planned stunt of some kind? Time will tell, and the  Current  plans to investigate. Stay tuned..."

Tesla's Supercharger team layoffs perplex EV charging industry - Canary Media,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxQSU1OcFBjR28tVXY4T1RnYXRxOHRKVjJRMThkRzVaU0toY3FxbWx1cXFISGZwUVY5QnhxYlZ3T2c2R0dKLWNGdUpCZWVVNlltaHMzd3A3WDJ2RWVINXBlbjY2TWxoNXlMWkd1a1RGZFVzbW1xLTgwcFU2MzN5UjhQWEszLTFvcnNGZXhiWGZrMFdLS1RFM3V2MVVNVWZ4c2lfa2pyY0pwZWJMMTZ6dHlkNWw3SmN4LVJyMEwtN1hB?oc=5,"Thu, 02 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Still, without the Tesla charging team to shepherd the ongoing implementation of that technology across the industry,  ​ “ further improvements to standards and engagements across the industry will suffer,” Jameson wrote.       Tesla’s layoffs also cast uncertainty over the projects the company has won with state transportation departments as part of the Biden administration’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure ( NEVI ) initiative, a  $ 5  billion formula grant program  created as part of the  2021  Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill.       According to data from the  EV  and charging analytics firm EVAdoption, Tesla won  18  percent of the projects awarded in the earliest round of  NEVI  awards for five states, worth about $ 8 . 5  million,  The Wall Street Journal  reported  in September. By February of this year, Tesla had racked up wins for projects in seven of  15  states that had announced their  NEVI  awards, according to EVAdoption data,  E & E News reported .       To participate in the federal program, Tesla had to make its chargers usable by EVs beyond its own — a requirement seen as the impetus behind Tesla’s push to make  NACS  an open standard.       But simply certifying the  NACS  technology standard is just the first step in a long and arduous process of working with multiple  EV  and charger manufacturers, technology providers, and public and private-sector partners, said Nigro of Atlas Public Policy — work that’s all new to the previously closed-off Tesla. The checkered history of other U.S. public charging networks, which have  struggled to maintain high levels of reliability and service quality  despite using a common charging technology standard, indicates how hard that can be in the real-world.       “ There’s a lot of external communication that goes on between a charging provider like Tesla and utilities, state agencies, or automakers trying to get access to the Supercharger network,” Nigro said.  ​ “ Losing those contacts and all the expertise is going to be expensive and will introduce delays in the rollout of new charging sites, or the availability of the Supercharger to more automakers.”       There’s an enormous gap between the  EV  charging that’s been deployed to date and what is needed to meet the Biden administration’s goal for EVs to make up half of all U.S. car sales by the end of the decade. Analysts predict that the U.S. will  need between  500 , 000  and  1 . 2  million public charging ports  by  2030  to achieve that goal. The Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the U.S. will need  182 , 000  fast chargers to support between  30  million and  42  million EVs on the road by  2030 .       Today, the country has  just over  41 , 000  fast-chargers  — and more than half were built by Tesla.   What is  EV  charging worth to Tesla?    The value of the Supercharger network to Tesla’s underlying  EV  business is hard to determine.       From the perspective of its value as a marketing and sales tool,  ​ “ it’s likely a very sizable profit center for the company,” given its intangible but unquestioned value in convincing  EV  buyers to opt for a Tesla instead of a competing  EV , Nigro said.       “ If you just look at it as a seller of energy, that’s less clear,” he said.  ​ “ Making money selling electrons is hard.”       Tesla doesn’t break out the performance of its Supercharger business unit in its broader financial reporting. But  Bloomberg estimated  in April that the company generated about $ 1 . 74  billion in revenue from its chargers last year.       Given its prospects of serving large swaths of the future U.S.  EV  charging network,  ​ “ the Supercharger network is going to be printing money very soon,” said Bill Ferro,  CTO  of Paren, an EV-charging reliability and data analytics company.  ​ “ Now that the industry has selected the connector, they appear to be abandoning their network,” he said — a move that  ​ “ simply defies logic.”       Based on the expansion of its chargers for use by EVs beyond Teslas, the network could achieve $ 740  million in profit by  2030 , Bloomberg projected — a fraction of its  $ 13 . 6  billion in gross profit last year , but not a financial loss by any means.       But it’s far from clear that Tesla’s broader success in the increasingly competitive  EV  market relies on it keeping up the pace of the Supercharger deployments that got it to where it is today, said Pavel Molchanov, managing director and equity research analyst at Raymond James  &  Associates.       “ A decade ago, when the entire  EV  value chain was in its infancy, it was reasonable for Tesla to invest its own capital in deploying chargers,” he said.  ​ “ But today, there are so many stand-alone companies in  EV  charging.” These include ChargePoint, Electrify America, and EVgo in North America and  BP  pulse, Fastned, and Ionity in Europe.       More chargers are also set to be deployed by automakers themselves. Last year,  BMW , General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis announced  plans to invest at least $ 1  billion  to deploy  30 , 000  charging ports on highways and cities in the U.S. and Canada.       “ So there is really no need for Tesla to spend money on what is fundamentally a low-margin commodity business: selling electricity to drivers,” Molchanov said.  ​ “ If everything at Tesla were going perfectly, these additional expenses would not be a big deal. But given that Musk is aggressively trying to cut costs at the company, the Supercharger division is a logical area to look at.”       This short-term financial logic may be cold comfort to all the companies and public agencies that have wedded their  EV  charging expansion and reliability improvement plans to Tesla’s core technology. But it may also open up opportunities for charging competitors, said Beia Spiller, director of the transportation program at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit environmental economics research organization.       “ I do think there’s a drawback for people expecting Tesla to expand into their areas and to see these chargers deployed through  NEVI ,” she said. But  ​ “ the good news is that the standard does exist. Who’s going to come in and use that standard to build these charging stations?”"

Hate The Pointed Pyramid Roof On The Tesla CyberTruck? Let’s Chop It Off - The Autopian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWZ5UFpsNHlMLVdjcjhrRnZOWERrWTNQeUJ6cDJsUDJvcTU2NVVyekFZcFBCdUxsMm51eGtzVF9EZDRIYW9aWXdFZTF2SU1LVFB3QlZaTmwxWWtPcmVXdDB4U3dIT1lPb1RvZG5BNm1NVHI4a19fUTVLZXpDSldHSnBMUEZVbHJfQm1kTVFfcjJ2UFU1UWNlRTJlbnYyRm1m?oc=5,"Mon, 20 May 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Is the Cybertruck really playing 3D chess with our brains? The polarizing aspects of this  cause celebre  have resulted in the myth outgrowing the object itself.   Haters can’t stop talking about how much they despise it, thus throwing more attention in Tesla’s direction than millions of promotional dollars ever could do, while also mobilizing Tesla’s most fervent fans to defend it, churning more no-cost attention for the Cybertruck.     Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   How many Cyberfans truly like the appearance, I wonder? Obviously, many really do. Others may not like it, but don’t say so for fear of running afoul of their fellow tribe members, if not (gasp!) Elon Musk himself. And it seems like those at the  stan dom end of the fandom spectrum are instantly convinced any move Musk or Tesla makes is ideal, optimal, beyond questioning, so clearly the Cybertruck is the greatest shape ever to wear four wheels.  Obviously .   I really don’t know, but it’s obvious that from a subjective design standpoint finding faults with the Cybertruck is like shooting fish in a barrel. Some elements are so bad that removing them entirely seems to improve the design tremendously, even if these elements are rather critical to the functionality of the truck itself. Like the roof. Allow me to explain …   Peak Silliness   No matter how close or far away you’re standing from a Cybertruck, you can see parts of the design to take issue with. Why not start with what you can see from a football field away? I’m referring to the pyramid-shaped roof.       Very few (if any) production cars have taken on a roof shape like this, for good reason: Generally speaking, the tallest parts of a car should be above the passengers’ heads to give them the most room possible. With the Cybertruck’s triangular profile, the tallest point is just ahead of the backrest of the front seats, and the space tapers rapidly to the rear of the truck. To give passengers the most room possible, that point has to move extremely high; you’ll likely need the roof to be tall enough to hit the top of your garage door in order to get enough space over the rear seat occupants without having them sit on the floor.     Sometime back, I was Photoshop-scribbling over a side view of Cybertruck and removed the top of the roof. Then, for some reason, I cut off the side glass. As I was about to draw on some new roof line, a strange realization came to me: the stripped-down, sketch-in-progress Cybertruck looked better. It still looked like a Pinewood Derby entry from a Cub Scout who actually built the car himself without a handy dad (or mom, I’m cool) to “help,” but at least the stupid pointed roof was gone. If I squinted a bit – or a lot – the angled ends and open middle compartment almost resembled a targa-topped exotic like a Lamborghini Aventedor.     How would this even work? Here’s a possible way that would require a lot of convoluted thinking and unproven technologies, much like everything else on the truck itself.   The Real Tesla Roadster?   To make an  al fresco  Cybertruck, we need to add frameless side windows and back doors with fully retracting glass, a style not seen in these parts since the big pillarless sedans of the late sixties. Next, the pyramid roof would be split into two separate planes that must either be removed and left behind or somehow stashed over the cargo area. In our favor, we can see the roof panels are narrower than the truck bed where we need them to go.     You could have both panels lift out like a manual targa top, but due to the Cybetruck’s height, two very tall people would be required to make such a removal possible.   Instead, I’m thinking about an electric “Jacob’s ladder” type mechanism. A full-length overhead console down the middle of the glass roof could be a “spine” that contains the pivot mechanism for the front and rear panels to fold them onto themselves, while a second mechanism would pivot the folded panels back over the cargo bed.   It’s not unlike the Renault WIND coupe/cabrio from years past:   source: Renault   You could also tilt up the folded roof to access whatever might be sitting the bed. You’d have enough stiffness in the windshield frame and just behind the seats to provide some rollover protection.               Here’s an underside view of the folding roof:     The sides of the roof sections could be silver as on the fixed roof model but finishing them in black (as I’ve done below) gives the open-topped model a different look even with the top in place. Once everyone that wants a Cybertruck actually has one, those that just have to stand out will need that differentiation. Here you go, you narcissistic knobs:     The lower windshield (with the top open, of course) creates a new problem, and the solution might be better than the “problem” we’re trying to fix. I’m talking about the Cybertruck’s giant windshield wiper. A single wiper as on the standard truck wouldn’t be long enough to clear the whole windscreen, so we’d have to resort to adding a second wiper on the passenger’s side of the glass. We’ve now inadvertently created what’s likely a better rain-cleaning system than on the fixed-roof example.     I can’t stand the Cybertruck’s wheel covers (original or new,  non-tire-chewing ) so I added the charcoal-toned  aftermarket Unplugged Performance wheels  with Italian-looking hexagonal openings. It’s an improvement, adding an almost Lamborghini Silhouette-style Gandini style to the thing, if Gandini had been hung over from a bachelor party the night before and lost his glasses at a strip club.   Naturally, we’d have something that would be totally blind to the rear but it pretty much is anyway with the cargo cover closed. That cargo cover would need to roll up at a lower point to clear the top mechanism as well, and stay open when the roof was retracted.   So Many Other Issues You Won’t Notice The Roof Problems   Chopping the roof off of virtually any car or truck doesn’t always make it better, but it certainly turns it into a vehicle that’s more fun for more than just the driver. Taking a Sawzall to Elon’s controversial sort-of truck doesn’t make a lot of sense, but then neither does the Cybertruck itself.   Would the Cybertruck Roadster bend in half with the top off? Could the mechanism to retract it have serious mechanical issues? Are leaks going to be the agenda for the (rainy) day?

Some investors have put this decline in fortunes down to the fact that Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, is also dealing with running media giant X/Twitter. Others, meanwhile, have pointed to the broader tides pulling on the automotive industry right now. But what have British consumers made of the carmaker‘s brand over the past couple of years? YouGov BrandIndex UK can show that, since a transfer in ownership of Twitter was first mooted back in April 2022, Tesla’s image has deteriorated. The manufacturer’s Index scores, our measure of overall brand health, were at 7.6 on 14 April 2022 – the day the news broke – compared to a score of 8.5 for the average car brand. By 28 October of that year, when the acquisition was completed, scores had dropped to 4.0, and they have not been as high since. At their lowest, Tesla’s brand health measures sunk to -4.2 (26 Jan 2023), and our more recent data (30 April 2024) has them at -2.6. In just a little over two years, the automaker has gone from being nearly as robust a brand as the average car manufacturer to – given the average score of 9.4 for car brands across the sector – one that’s 12 points less healthy. The car manufacturer’s biggest shareholder – Musk - has argued that it has been a “tough quarter” for others in the sector, and it would be too easy to draw a direct line between his online profile and Tesla’s recent performance. But the data nevertheless underscores what a difficult few months this has been for the automaker’s brand, which may have been particularly harmed in comparison to other non-EV specialists by the bumpy recent nature of electric vehicle demand."

The Model Y was setting sales records, and would be the best-selling car in the world the following year. On the production side, Tesla delivered over a million cars in a year for the first time ever. The company’s biggest problem? It couldn’t make cars fast enough to keep up with demand.   Tesla needed to increase capacity, so Elon Musk decided to build a factory in Mexico. He visited Monterrey in October 2022, with the official announcement arriving the following March. At the time, Tesla estimated the factory would take  12 to 15 months  to build — slightly longer than the construction of Tesla’s factory in Shanghai.    It’s now 15 months since that estimate, and the picture looks very different.  According to local reports , there’s been little work on the site over the last year, outside of municipal infrastructure like nearby roads and stormwater expansions. It doesn’t look like Tesla is in any hurry either,  telling suppliers  there’s no rush to deliver the factory’s equipment.   It’s a lesson in how dramatically markets can shift in a short period of time   On an investor call in October, Musk seemed undecided on when the plant would open. “We’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items,” he said. “But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory.” The expected completion date has slipped from mid-2024 to 2025 or 2026, and could easily slip further.   In part, it’s a lesson in how dramatically markets can shift in a short period of time. Since Tesla’s Monterrey plant was announced, there’s been a global slowdown in demand for electric vehicles, as rising interest rates have made auto loans more expensive and gas-powered cars are  making a surprising comeback . Tesla has also seen heated new competition from  Chinese rivals like BYD and Aito , increasing the risk of oversupply across the industry. Tesla responded with price cuts, but the result is that it makes less profit from each car than it did in 2022, and there’s a lot less urgency to ramp up production. In the face of slackening demand and more mature competition, production volume isn’t Tesla’s biggest problem anymore.   But it’s not just Tesla’s goals that have shifted. The landslide victory of incoming Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum heralds a shift for the country, too. In one of her  few public statements on the Tesla plant , Sheinbaum has highlighted  concerns that it would exacerbate droughts  in the region. Beyond that, it’s too soon to say what Sheinbaum’s rise to power will mean for Tesla, but it’s an important unanswered question for the company.   Most analysts believe Tesla will eventually finish the plant, simply because so much money has already been committed. But as the road gets longer, there are likely to be more bumps and detours, some of which may be expensive. And when Gigafactory Mexico finally opens its doors, it will arrive into a world very different from what Musk envisioned in October 2022."

Key Highlights:     Tesla Model Y  is the top American-made vehicle for the third year.   Tesla  remains the only domestic automaker in the top 10.   Over  50% of vehicles  on the index are assembled in non-UAW-represented facilities in the Southern U.S.   U.S.-based auto production facilities have  increased by 144%  since 2020.       Tesla’s Dominance and Competition   Cars.com’s 19th annual American-Made Index has highlighted Tesla’s  Model Y  as the most American vehicle for the third consecutive year. While Tesla did not repeat its 2023 sweep of the top four spots, it still managed to secure three positions in the top 10.  Tesla’s Model X and  Model 3  experienced drops in rankings , but the automaker continues to lead as the only domestic manufacturer in the top 10.   Southern U.S. Production Boom     The 2024 index reveals a significant shift in U.S. auto production, with over  50% of the top 100 vehicles assembled in the Southern United States.  Alabama stands out with 15 vehicles produced across various towns, contributing to the local economy through foreign investments from Mazda, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and Mercedes-Benz. Interestingly,  39% of the vehicles on the index were built by UAW-represented labor .   Midwest Manufacturing Powerhouse     Despite the Southern boom, Michigan remains a key player with 16 vehicles on the index. Detroit, the heart of America’s auto industry, benefits from the presence of GM and Ford.  GM has the highest representation on the index with 18 vehicles,  while Ford follows with 12. Both companies significantly contribute to Michigan’s economy.     Electrification Trends     While  77% of the vehicles on the index are gas-powered,  there is a noticeable increase in electrified vehicles, reflecting a 130% growth since 2020. This includes a  100% rise in  EVs  and a 150% increase in hybrids and plug-in hybrids.   Methodology Insights     The American-Made Index evaluates vehicles based on assembly location, parts sourcing, U.S. factory employment, engine sourcing, and transmission sourcing.

Elon Musk Says Tesla FSD AI Having Exactly The Problem I Thought 2 Years Ago It Was Having - CleanTechnica,https://news.google.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?oc=5,"Tue, 18 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Sign up for  CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries , sign up for  our daily newsletter , and/or  follow us on Google News !       Last Updated on:  18th June 2024, 12:47 pm    During the Q&A session of the 2024 Tesla annual shareholder meeting, in response to one of the questions about Full Self Driving (FSD), CEO Elon Musk explained something about Tesla’s FSD development that completely affirms a suspicion I had two years ago. Also, this is one of the key challenges that made me a bit concerned about whether Tesla’s approach will lead to robotaxi capability.   I’ll start with  what Elon said , emphasizing in bold the key part I’m highlighting. “As the system gets better, it gets harder to figure out which AI model is better. Because now, like thousands of miles between interventions, how do we, as quickly as possible, figure out which AI model is better. And when you make these different AI models, they’re obviously not, like, super deterministic.  So, you have one model that eliminates one problem, but creates another problem .” I’ll come back to the rest of this segment later and how Tesla is dealing with the issue and trying to get around it, but I just want to emphasize here that it’s not simply the challenge of picking the best model, but the challenge of one problem getting fixed while another problem is created. Let’s return briefly to  what I wrote more than two years ago  when I started noticing this problem:   “Basically, I’ve been trying to understand reasons why Tesla FSD isn’t as good as I’d hoped it would be by now, and why it sometimes gets significantly worse. One potential issue is what I’m calling the ‘see-saw problem.’ If my theory is correct to any notable degree, it could be a critical fault in Tesla’s approach to widespread, generalized self driving.   “My concern is that as Tesla corrects flagged issues and uploads new software to Tesla customer cars, those corrections create issues elsewhere. In other words, they are just playing software see-saw.”   I don’t know how much that was happening two years ago compared to today, but with Musk acknowledging that it’s happening, let’s take a look at how he says Tesla is trying to solve the problem.   “So, we’re trying to solve this by a combination of simulation; uploading models, having them run in shadow mode — so, it’s actually kind of helpful not everyone has Full Self Driving, because we can see … we can run it in shadow mode and see ‘what would this new model have done compared to what the user did.’ So, since we’ve got millions of cars that we can do this with, that gives us a delta between what the AI model predicted it would do and the user would do. And if you kind of sum up the errors between them, you can see, ‘oh, there was a bigger error stack from this model versus that model’ when you uploaded them into — we each uploaded them into 100,000 cars.”   He then goes into a bit more detail on how they are trying to advance from model to model. “But that’s the biggest limiter right now — it’s not training, it’s not data, it’s  actually testing  the AI models. And then figuring out clever ways to figure out if a new model is better or not. Like we know like there are particular intersections that are difficult. […] Like, all the models will be great at driving on a well painted road with no intersection. They’ll all be great at that. […] So, we’ve identified several thousand intersections in the United States where we’ll actually take the new model and try the car in those very difficult intersections.”   He also added that they haven’t yet uncorked any of the extra ability of FSD “Hardware 4,” but says they’ll do that later this year.   Overall, the big question with regard to identifying new better and better models, and overcoming the aforementioned “see-saw problem,” is how quickly Tesla can do this in order to roll out unsupervised full self driving and robotaxis. Will it take a year? 10 years? Obviously, Elon Musk is optimistic they’ll get there soon, but as even Musk states, he’s chronically overly optimistic. What’s your estimate?

Driving  Tesla's Cybertruck  was a mix of fun, frustration, and embarrassment.    The truck includes all the standard Tesla features, plus some extras not found on the Model 3 or Y.   The speedy acceleration was a blast and the adjustable suspension made it easy to exit the truck.         I spent three days with Tesla's long-awaited Cybertruck. It was one of the strangest — and  most frustrating  — trips I've taken in a while. (It was also embarrassing, with people gawking everywhere I went.) But across miles of highways, city blocks, and tight parking lots, the truck proved to be fast and fun, albeit ridiculously weird-looking. It had all the standard Tesla features, like a huge screen for controlling almost everything, along with some extras thrown in that you can't find on the Model 3 and Model Y. I also found some silly things that Tesla seemed to overlook (like a  bad charging port design  and a lack of ceiling   handles for entering and exiting), but other little touches made the $100,000 truck feel luxurious. Here are 10 features that impressed me:         The acceleration was a blast.         The Cybertruck does not mess around when it comes to power.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              The acceleration was hands-down my favorite thing about the truck. Pop it into sport mode (making sure any passengers have their heads on the headrest), floor the accelerator, and hang on tight. From 0 to 60, 70, 80, and (presumably) even more, the truck doesn't hesitate while gobbling up the road ahead. The regenerative braking, which isn't optional, took a while to get used to — and was particularly tricky for the first few miles I drove in the truck each day. Back off the accelerator to coast like you're used to in a traditional car, and you'll be in for a nauseous ride. But hold the pedal in place, and the truck cruises smoothly down the road, responding to small touches as needed.           Hidden wireless charging offered easy convenience.         The wireless charging in the center console was one of my favorite features of the Cybertruck.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              Throw your phone in the slot next to the cupholder where it (or a key) needs to be to operate the truck, and quick, automatic wireless charging kicks in. It's a classy touch that surprised me when I used it, and I would definitely appreciate it if this were my own vehicle.           The lack of door handles had a surprising upside.         Touch the hidden button on the Cybertruck's B-Pillar and the door opens.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              Although the lack of traditional door handles was strange at first, I got used to it quickly. And when my hands were full, the doors were surprisingly simple to open. To enter, you press a button on the door pillar, and the door pops ajar — just enough to grab it and open it fully (or nudge or kick or whatever it takes, depending on the situation).           Tesla’s nifty trip planner accounts for variables like the weather.         Tesla's trip planner told me what was affecting my battery range, including weather, hills, and using the air conditioner.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              I drove to a Supercharger one day and tested out the Cybertruck trip planner's range estimation. The planner logged details like hard acceleration (my bad), strong winds, and air conditioning (a necessity in Texas) as factors contributing to changes in its assumed final charge level. When all was said and done, its original estimate was only a few miles off from what it had projected hundreds of miles before. Impressive! Especially since some other automakers have struggled with similar software.           The Cybertruck is loaded with electrical outlets.          Tesla's Cybertruck comes with handy outlets in the bed (like most trucks on the market today, gas or electric).                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              The truck is electric, after all, so it should be easy to sip on some of that juice. Handy plugs around the truck's bed and frunk, as well as inside the cabin for electronic devices, are a common feature of most electric trucks, and the Cybertruck was no exception.           The back seat was nearly as enjoyable as the front.         Tesla's rear entertainment screen has almost all the functions of its larger front-seat main screen.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              I don't think anyone would be mad about being stuck in the Cybertruck's back seat on a longer road trip. It's much more comfortable than most pickup truck cabs, with plenty of legroom and seats that aren't completely vertical. And you get a personal entertainment screen with games and movies, total climate control, natural light from the sunroof, and cupholders.           The Cybertruck's adjustable suspension made it easier to enter and exit.         The Cybertruck automatically lowers its suspension for entry and exit when parked.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              To be clear, the Cybertruck is bigger than it needs to be, but that's true for 99% of the  trucks on American roads . Still, I appreciated how the truck's adjustable suspension lowered a few inches when shifted into park for an easier entry and exit. While driving, you can adjust this suspension higher or lower for comfort, as well.           The lockable glove box didn't require a key.          If you need to get into your glove box in a hurry, this might be more of an annoyance than a feature.                                             Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              Everything on this truck is supposed to be futuristic and the glove box is no exception. Even though I had full access to the truck with the keycard and app permissions, the Turo host was able to store things (what are they hiding?) in the glove box that I could not access without a PIN. No latch or lock also delivers a clean aesthetic.           The powered bed cover was easy to maneuver.           The locking tonneau cover on the Cybertruck can be controlled by buttons near the bed, the app, or inside the vehicle.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              The tonneau cover on the Cybertruck is just as important for its alien looks as it is for aerodynamics and security. It's controllable through the app, the interior screen, and buttons on the bed rails — and comes standard on the $100,000 truck.           Really fast charging was highly convenient.         Tesla's Superchargers are known for being the best. But the network's growth is in question.                                            Graham Rapier/Business Insider                                              The first 800-volt powertrain in Tesla's lineup charges impressively fast. Tesla has said the Cybertruck can travel up to 340 miles on a single charge and has promised to eventually release a range extender, or optional second battery pack. Some Cybertruck reviewers have said the truck's peak power tapers off quickly. But I didn't experience this in my two charging experiences, thanks to a limit the owner had set to protect the batteries' long-term health."
Toddler trapped in car when Tesla battery dies in Scottsdale - AZFamily,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOWWptekxUbjhwemU5bC1nU2FOQ1pSMmU2ZndYekZBdVItcWRXR3ZyWFdYT0ZJeFpUR29YSGtESVNFZUdNYUNLMjNMaTVwTm01VWkzRUtrNktfbGVFREpkVy1aOWp4RE1PQzdJcXUxV1dDYVA0cmVYRlhvbGh3dHk1SUVPVFNFTnZzbG82MENjTGJyUFV4cEHSAaoBQVVfeXFMTmw3XzBTejV5S2xVYVNvbkJZVDBneFBvZkNVTDZfY21RRGVSS0JOcnpRN01KSUs0cXN2eEZyMVp4Tzc2XzdDOUhfVEZkcUZ6Rnh3WEJzNUV6bUV0eU1GRWFfRzdZTU5PSm1hMGlSOXI2aW9jcEdNaUxQREE1WkYwcjBfbkNIUzl4OFAwUDdGdFNvS2pkNGJmT2x4S1N2T0hXLURxNTRtaEpWUEE?oc=5,"Wed, 19 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","SCOTTSDALE, AZ (AZFamily)  — Renee Sanchez says she’s a big fan of Tesla, but what happened to her recently has changed her mind. The Scottsdale grandmother tells On Your Side that she loaded her 20-month-old granddaughter into her car seat for a trip to the Phoenix Zoo. “And I closed the door, went around the car, get in the front seat, and my car was dead,” she said. “I could not get in. My phone key wouldn’t open it. My card key wouldn’t open it.” As On Your Side explained in a recent report , when the Tesla battery that operates electronics dies, a hidden latch on the driver’s side armrest will manually unlock the door. Many Tesla owners don’t know about this latch. But in this case, Sanchez was stuck outside of her  Tesla  while the toddler was trapped inside, buckled into a car seat. Sanchez tells On Your Side she had no option but to call 911, which immediately sent out Scottsdale firefighters. “And when they got here, the first thing they said was, ‘Uggh, it’s a Tesla. We can’t get in these cars,’” she said. “And I said, ‘I don’t care if you have to cut my car in half. Just get her out.’” Firefighters were forced to break a window with an axe, but they first covered the window with tape to keep the glass from flying. Meanwhile, Sanchez’s granddaughter sat alone inside the Tesla, which was getting hotter and hotter. “She was OK for the first few minutes,” Sanchez said. “But as soon as the firemen came and all the commotion started and the windows getting broken into, she started crying because she was scared.” A firefighter climbed through the window and pulled the little girl free. They even gave her a little fire hat to calm her down. “After I knew she was safe, then the anger,” she said. “Then, all the thoughts of, oh my God, this could have been so much worse.” The 12-volt battery that powers the car’s electronics died without warning. Tesla drivers are supposed to receive three warnings before that happens, but the Tesla service department confirmed that Sanchez didn’t receive any warnings. “When that battery goes, you’re dead in the water,” she said. On Your Side has learned there is a way for drivers to unlock their cars when they’re stuck outside, but it’s a complicated series of time-consuming steps involving wires and battery chargers. But again, many Tesla owners and first responders don’t know about it. “They need to educate the first responders because they had no idea,” Sanchez said. “They were as much in the dark as I was.” Sanchez wants to see Tesla add a better option to get into a car with a dead battery. And while she has been a big supporter of the company, this latest episode has shaken her faith. “I give Tesla props. When it works, it’s great. But when it doesn’t, it can be deadly,” Sanchez said.

Tesla heads back to court still hoping to pay CEO Elon Musk billions - Legal Dive,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOTm5uUVdBZi1UMG5fZXcyOFVTY1VzR1dZNzE4b19STHhjOHlnd2o2U1hOOGtvOXJadkk3VkpUTkFPUTVzcnFud3dULVB1UUlkNnZFaWxBTEN5S1ZjS3dpTWFCbjRtUk54dmRSM2R3R1c2T1I0RkFmNl9zV1M3RjZzN1gtWmN0cmhNQnRaa1ZxaDBDSTd0a2MxX01lYy1KZkF3NWthOQ?oc=5,"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Listen to the article          4 min                          This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have  feedback .                Dive Brief:     After winning a shareholder vote on June 13, Tesla wants a Delaware Chancery Court to reconsider her prior ruling that quashed a record pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk worth tens of billions of dollars. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in January that Tesla directors had not acted in shareholders’ interest in 2018 when the board approved $56 billion compensation for Musk.   Tesla shareholders have now twice voted to award Musk the massive package, and the company is hoping the second vote will influence McCormck’s position on the case. Tesla valued Musk’s pay package at $44.9 billion in its  April proxy filing , owing to a 24% decline in Tesla’s stock price over the past year.    The losing party is nearly certain to appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, regardless of whether McCormick alters her prior ruling.     Dive Insight:   A week after the shareholder vote, Tesla asked the Court of Chancery for an expedited briefing schedule to consider the vote’s impact, arguing that 72% of stockholders supported paying Musk the large compensation deal.   “Defendants contend that the consequences of the Ratification alter the course of this litigation and any relief that is potentially available (and relatedly, any attorneys’ fees that may be awarded to Plaintiff’s Counsel), and thus cannot be ignored in an action that is supposed to advance the bests interests of the Company,” Tesla’s lawyers wrote.   The electric automaker still faces a daunting task in court as it seeks to award Musk the huge windfall. The shareholder vote doesn’t directly affect McCormick’s decision, which deemed the pay package improper on substantive grounds and not for technical reasons,  Legal Dive reported  in April.   A group of Tesla shareholders, led by Richard Tornetta, a drummer for a Philadelphia-based heavy metal band,  sued in 2019 , saying that Tesla’s board was conflicted and effectively controlled by Musk when it came to designing the CEO’s compensation.   Tesla’s second shareholder vote “is a transparent attempt to score a public relations victory, pressure the Court, and delay proceedings in this Action — perhaps so Defendants can deploy additional gambits that will needlessly complicate matters and consume further precious judicial resources,” the plaintiffs wrote Friday in a brief opposing Tesla’s request for an expedited hearing in light of the second vote.    McCormick has set a hearing for July 8, with legal matters, including the appropriate level of fees for the shareholders’ attorneys, led by Bernstein  Litowitz  Berger & Grossman LLP.   The new shareholder approval may help the company’s position more on appeal than with the judge who has already weighed the merits of the case.   Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware law professor and founding director of the university’s  John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, told Legal Dive he  doesn’t expect that McCormick will reverse or soften her previous ruling, which she published in April.    “They’re going to try arguing that (shareholder) ratification cleansed the transaction,” said Elson, a noted critic of Musk’s pay deal. The judge “found that it was a gift and added no incentive value” to Musk as an executive, he said.   In May, Elson said Tesla had  threatened to end its relationship  with Holland & Knight, where Elson worked as a consultant, if he filed a brief to the court opposing Musk’s large payout. Elson said he resigned from the firm as a result of that incident.   Tesla did not respond to a message seeking comment on the case.   Tesla also sought, and received, shareholder permission to move its legal home from Delaware to Texas, where the company is based. The Austin-based company said June 13 it has completed the  filing process  to become incorporated in Texas."

In what would seem like a Stephen King novel, Sanchez was locked out of her  Tesla  but her grandchild was locked in.  According to KPHO news station in  Phoenix , her car’s battery died, and none of her electronic devices to unlock the door worked.   After calling 911, firefighters broke into the Tesla to  save the child .  What should Tesla owners do if the battery dies? According to the Tesla owner’s manual, if the Tesla runs out of driving range, the low-voltage battery is no longer supported. The vehicle cannot charge when the battery isn’t on. The manual suggests owners follow these steps:  Jump-start the low-voltage battery. This is required as the low-voltage battery must be started to support the high-voltage battery. A guide on how to properly  jump-start a Tesla can be found here . Wait a few minutes. Once the touchscreen powers on, plug the charging cable into your Tesla to begin charging the high-voltage battery. When the vehicle begins to charge as normal, disconnect the external power supply from the low-voltage battery.  How to open a Tesla from inside the vehicle when the battery dies? According to the report, when a Tesla battery dies, a hidden latch on the driver’s side armrest manually unlocks the door. In Sanchez's case, she was locked out of her Tesla while her granddaughter was trapped inside, buckled into a car seat.  How much does a Tesla battery replacement cost? According to  Recurrent Auto , replacing a Tesla battery could cost between $5,000 and $20,000, depending on the model.  In a  2021 Tesla impact report , the company said that its battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. Tesla issues recalls on several vehicles Tesla has had several recalls on their vehicles, including: Seat Belt Warning Lights and Chimes : Over 125,000 Tesla vehicles, including Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y from various production years, were recalled due to seat belt warning lights and chimes potentially failing to activate. This issue, discovered during an internal audit, involves a switch problem that can prevent the necessary alerts when the seat belt is not fastened.  Backup Camera Malfunction : In January 2024, Tesla recalled about 200,000 Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles due to a software issue that prevented the backup camera from working when the car was in reverse. Cybertruck Accelerator Pedal Issue : Tesla recalled nearly 4,000 Cybertrucks due to a problem with the accelerator pedal. High force on the pedal could cause it to dislodge and get trapped in the interior trim, increasing the risk of a collision. Bad windshield   wipers and bed trim:  Tesla is recalling thousands of Cybertruck vehicles for its faulty windshield wipers and trunk bed trim. The windshield wiper recall affects all 2024 Cybertruck vehicles — about 11,688 trucks — manufactured between Nov. 13, 2023 and June 6, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Tesla is also recalling 11,383 Cybertruck vehicles manufactured between Nov 13, 2023, and May 26, due to loose applique can detach from the truck."
"“I'll stay on strike for months or even years to get this collective agreement”: In Sweden, the fight against Tesla continues - Equal Times",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFBUTG1US2x0MVJMc2tBaU5ERFJvb2NSVzZPcFU5Rkc2NzVJTy1sT2c4VV9zMDdKSm5MQUg0OThtSVU0UzB6bDNaX1hJeU51MnZ3OFQ3WHVwZTZxRVh4WVVhZGJ2Skx5d1NHS2RjbA?oc=5,"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Citizens and trade unions in Europe continue to fight against the methods employed by the American company Tesla. While plans to expand the company’s German production site at Grünheide, near Berlin, are still being  contested by local environmental activists , Tesla mechanics in Sweden have been on strike for the last eight month. They have been supported by a large cross-industry boycott.   In Malmö, located in the country’s south, a large banner from the Swedish industrial workers’ union IF Metall hangs on the gates of a Tesla dealership. Its message is clear: “KONFLIKT”, followed by the subtitle: “I Sverige kör vi med kollektivavtal” (“In Sweden, we operate under collective bargaining agreements”).   Across the street, two of the mechanics, wearing safety waistcoats in the IF Metall colours, are picketing against Tesla this May. Janis Kuzma and his colleague [who wished to remain anonymous] were motivated to join the movement, launched by IF Metall, by working conditions and their relationship with their superiors.   “If you have different views, you risk being sacked”   Janis Kuzma was the first to lay down his tools last October. He has now been on strike for eight months. “When we were at full capacity in the summer of 2023, there were 15 of us in the small workshop, we were stepping on each other’s toes,” he explains. According to Janis and his colleague, the tight quarters were exacerbated by stress and poor planning.     “Many of them were often off sick because they were physically and mentally exhausted,” they say. Each mechanic works on five vehicles every day.     If one of the mechanics complained, “the human resources manager told them that Tesla wasn’t for everyone and that they were free to leave”. Martin Berglund, mediator for IF Metall, refers to Tesla’s false familial character: “Tesla’s internal communication is based on the idea that all of its employees are family,” he explains. “But in reality, Tesla is creating a company within a company, where it circumvents rules and regulations on a daily basis”. What shocks Janis is the total lack of dialogue with his superiors. “If you don’t agree with everything, if you have different views, you risk getting sacked,” he adds.   IF Metall recently accused Tesla of illegally terminating an employment contract. In the Umeå workshop, a worker was dismissed earlier than his contract stipulated, after five months instead of six. According to information provided by the IF Metall union, no valid reason was given by the company to justify the dismissal. Despite negotiations, the union was not able to achieve a favourable outcome for the mechanic. Convinced that his dismissal was linked to his participation in the strike, the union decided to lodge  a complaint with the Labour Court . So far, he is the only striker against Tesla whose contract has been ter-minated.   Tesla’s refusal to comply with the Swedish system   In Malmö, seven mechanics have deserted the workbench since the start of the dispute. Nationwide, more than thirty employees are standing up to the electric vehicle manufacturer. Their demands have not changed and can be summed up in a single sentence: they want a collective agreement to be signed. This would be an agreement between the company and its employees, via the unions, which sets out working and production conditions. But for the moment, Tesla is showing no signs of budging.   Collective agreements are the be-all and end-all of the Swedish system, whose Labour Code is succinct. The government allows companies and industry-level unions a great deal of freedom to negotiate the terms and conditions of employment (wages, contracts, etc.), working conditions (working hours, safety, etc.) and social benefits (pensions, holidays, etc.).     Collective agreements, though not compulsory, structure the balance of power between employers and employees in both the private and public sectors and guarantee a degree of stability and fairness within the economic sector.     In Sweden, almost  90 per cent of the workforce is covered  by a collective agreement, across all sectors.   The conflict between Tesla and its employees lies in the American company’s categorical refusal to sign the agreement. From autumn 2022 to summer 2023, IF Metall attempted to negotiate with Tesla to draw up a collective agreement. However, the company’s management refused to sign an agreement “on principle,” adding that labour rights were  not a part of “the company’s concept” . Last November, Tesla CEO Elon Musk openly stated that he disagrees with the idea of unions: “I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company and create a sort of  lords and peasants situation” .   In its strike notice, IF Metall insists that it is simply a question of  ""creating a situation of order , while avoiding conflict”. The agreement would provide security for both employees and employers: “The agreement guarantees that no one can go on strike to obtain better conditions than those set out in the agreement”.   A broad solidarity movement, across borders   Outside the Malmö workshop, the two strikers are joined by four other workers who take turns at the picket line. They are not Tesla employees but instead work in sales, accounting and the hospital sector. They have taken their half-day off to relieve the mechanics and ensure continuous presence.   The picket line is a reflection of the country. In solidarity with the workshop mechanics, the dockers, lorry drivers and electricians responsible for maintaining car charging stations have started to boycott Tesla. From the  musicians’ union to the postal workers’ union , several trades have joined IF Metall’s fight. “Port workers are still refusing to unload cars chartered by ship,” explains Johan Järvklo, International Secretary of IF Metall. “Tesla is now importing its vehicles by truck. In Vetlanda, unionised  Hydro  employees have refused to produce parts for Tesla”.     Sympathy for the strikers has even spread beyond Sweden’s borders. Last December,  Danish transport union 3F Transport  announced a blockade of the manufacturer’s cars in ports. This was followed by similar actions by Fellesforbundet in Norway and AKT in Finland.     The list continues to grow. At the beginning of May, Unionen, the union organisation for managers and office workers, lent its support to the strike at Tesla’s workshops. As a result, DEKRA International employees will no longer be inspecting products made by the the company. “In the US and Germany, the unions are also fighting for a collective agreement,” explains Johan Järvklo. “It’s really a global struggle and Sweden is currently at the forefront”.   At Tesla’s only European plant in Grünheide, Germany, IF Metall’s German counterpart IG Metall entered the works council for the first time in the latest internal elections at the beginning of 2024. However, the union failed to achieve an absolute majority of seats and is thus legally unable to negotiate a collective agreement, which it wishes to do  on wages , among other issues. IG Metall is actively working to recruit new members to change this situation.   Violations of the right to collective bargaining are becoming increasingly widespread. According to the International Trade Union Confederation’s latest annual  Global Rights Index  report, such violations have been observed in more than half of European countries in 2023 and in 73 per cent of countries worldwide.   All the more reason for IF Metall to see this strike through to the end. “This is about workers’ rights and their bargaining power, which is vital,” adds Mr Järvklo. “We don’t want the next companies to go down the same road and reject collective agreements too”. The union has no intention of giving up after eight months of struggle. By way of comparison, in 1995, Swedish employees at Toys “R” Us fought for three months before securing an agreement.   Strikebreakers called in to hamper the movement   Anders Kjellberg is a sociologist at Lund University and a specialist in trade unions. As he sees it, this strike differs from recent social movements in one significant way: Tesla is refusing all real negotiations and is calling in scabs. “Twenty-three workers from abroad have replaced the strikers,” explains Mr Kjellberg, who describes the strategy as unprecedented.     “In 1995, Toys ‘R’ Us circumvented the strike by using scabs within the factory. Here, Tesla is importing labour from its workshops in Europe”. In Kjellberg’s view, this is a problem for the movement, which he believes is becoming less efficient.     Beyond the fact that they are strike-breakers, Janis and his colleague have other doubts about the new recruits in the Malmö workshop. “To be hired in the workshop now, all you have to do is show a great interest in Tesla,” they argue. “Qualifications are not essential”. A sales manager pulls a car out of the garage for a check-up. It makes a suspicious noise, a rubbing sound from the wheels. Janis approaches the vehicle - he maintains good relations with his colleagues - and quickly notices that the front and rear wheels are inverted. “It’s inexperience and stress that lead to this kind of thing,” he says.   According to the strikers, the workshop is currently running slowly with the new recruits. Inside the garage, a banner hangs showing a hedgehog in a yellow waistcoat with the slogan “Tack, det är bra” (‘thanks, that’s fine’ in Swedish), Tesla’s way of letting them know that it’s doing just fine both without them and without conventions.   There is power in a union   The banner symbolises Tesla’s tone deaf attitude to the conflict. However, IF Metall is not prepared to give up and let the multinational win just yet. The Swedish union is in talks with its counterparts IG Metall in Germany and United Auto Workers (UAW) in the United States about a global strategy to continue the fight.

My Neighbor’s Tesla Model Y Shattered Its Window Because Of A Bafflingly Bad Design - The Autopian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNYm54aHZPMG8xZ2h5aTRpd0NEMnhRTEh2VE1IVXVLZmpSNG5MWEZLbFJUcFJBNDdQTnA2TEM2dHVjV2NnYUNDVnRvanQyMElGZlFwYmJOZ2lGVHFMbkVWd0pUWTVfUjFZR3QtUG5rR3Z1T3VlRVpuNVlRVjdXb0JGLUZlQWpJTHg5Q0E4czJmXzg3YWY0clZUQkxBd0VhdlEzd3dMYnplbE1lZXNLYmVJag?oc=5,"Thu, 06 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","I’m very fortunate to have interesting and kind people living next door to me. I haven’t always had that; my old neighbors in Los Angeles used to yell at my wife and me if we were being, um, intimate in our own bedroom, and the neighbor on the other side of us wanted to pick fights over trash can placement. My current neighbors are, especially by comparison, saints. They also are Tesla Model Y owners, and today their Model Y – which has been quite trouble-free up until now, they assure me, and I believe them – had a really confusing failure that indirectly caused the driver’s side window to shatter, because of what I think is a really terrible bit of design. I’ll explain.   So, when they tried to use the car today, they found the driver’s side door would not open. They went to the other side, which did open, and got in, and found that there were a number of warnings and alerts on the display.     Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   The warnings seemed to suggest some issue with the 12V battery, which caused a whole cascade of issues. But the bigger issue came as a consequence of the car’s strange power situation; some aspects of the car seemed to have power, some didn’t. Wanting to investigate more, my neighbor wanted to get into the driver’s seat, so she would have access to all the controls, etc. It makes sense, I’d want that, too.   So, she tried to open the door from the outside, and had no luck. She remembered there was an emergency door release, so she pulled that reaching over from the passenger’s side to get the door open, and was rewarded with a sickening  crack  as the driver’s side window cracked. Alarmed, she closed the door, which just made the cracks even bigger, effectively shattering the window, though for now it’s still holding together. But it’s very boned:     At this point she called me to come take a look. I brought a battery analyzer/charger to see how the 12V battery was doing, and it checked out okay, just with 50% charge. Not great, but not dead-dead. The bigger issues seemed to be that, for some reason, the doors on the driver’s side of the car had no power, the tailgate only had partial power (latch seemed to work, but the power struts to lift/close it were dead) and the lights were strange. The DRL on the left worked, but not the right, and the turn indicators worked only on the right up front and the left rear.     Looking on the internet , the power issue could be one of the body controllers, which seem to be named VCLeft, VCRight, VCFront, etc. That’s definitely annoying, but if that is what’s going on, that’s a module that can be swapped out and fixed. The bigger and more maddening issue here is the shattered window.   What I find absurd is that opening a door – even in an “emergency” context – could cause so much damage to the car. What happened is pretty clear, once you see it: for a Tesla Model Y’s doors to safely open, the window must drop down about an inch to clear the weatherstripping and molding on the body. If it doesn’t, the window gets caught, gets torqued, and shatters, just like what happened to my neighbor.     Now, this is  something of a known problem . In fact, Tesla had a sort-of fix for this, where they made sure that when the emergency door release was activated, the window would drop down, just like if the normal latch had been used. That’s great for preventing people from accidentally using the emergency release in normal circumstances (which seems to happen a fair amount,  from chatter on the forums , and the fact that people sell  these stickers ) but if the car has no power, or, like in my neighbor’s situation, partial power, then it doesn’t matter, since that window can’t go down without power.   Even Tesla’s own Model Y owner’s manual says to use the emergency release in situations where there is no power, but no mention is made of the fact that it’s very likely the window will shatter if you use it:     I suppose if you open the door really slowly and carefully, you can maybe get by without cracking the window, but this is specifically for  emergencies,  when slowly and carefully just isn’t really on the menu. Also, the way my neighbor opened the car wasn’t exactly panicked; it was just normal door-opening effort. If that window doesn’t drop down, it’s going to break.   Tesla suggests that in the case of getting out of a Model Y with no power, you use the rear seat doors instead, which don’t need to drop their windows. So, that means Tesla wants you to climb over the seats into the back, then go through this simple procedure to open the doors:       See! It’s a simple three-step process that just asks you to remove the mat from the inside of the rear door pocket. Easy!   Power issues aside, this is absolutely maddening, I think. Is there  any  good reason that the doors should work like this? I get that frameless doors are cool, but they’re not  that  cool, especially not cool enough to justify broken window glass. And other cars with frameless doors somehow manage to avoid this problem. Here’s some people talking about just this issue – where the window normally drops a bit to open the door, but for some reason, can’t – on a  Volkswagen Arteon forum , and the Arteon’s frameless door design manages to avoid shattering the window:   “You are still able to open the door even without power. The glass will just bend past the seal. For closing the door without power you just have to tuck it underneath the seal. This is what might happen if you forget to add a silicone lubricant at the bottom of the window after a car wash in the winter. My experience is from living in Norway with it.”   This is how I’ve seen most frameless doors work, where they just press the glass against a rubber weatherstripping seal and sometimes have a flexible seal in front of the glass, too. But never a rigid bezel that can get in the way and, you know, break the damn window. The only other car I could  find evidence of a similar problem was the McLaren MP4-12C.  The owner’s manual for that car even has a sort of warning about this:     That’s a McLaren, though, not a best-selling mass-market EV. Still sucks, of course.   Really, the whole powered latch for a door is a bit ridiculous as it is; opening car doors was a pretty solved problem, even without power assists. It’s just not needed. Did anyone  want  these?   The fact that my neighbors had a problem with their car, and through no fault of their own ended up with an entirely unrelated and expensive  other  problem just because of what is really a deeply stupid design just feels maddening. It’s such an unforced error, and if there’s a good reason it’s like this, I can’t figure out what it would be. I know there are other cars that lower their windows a bit when opening/closing the doors, but I’ve not heard of any that will actually shatter their own windows when the battery is dead.   Why was this ever considered okay? After seeing how easily this happens firsthand, I’m sort of appalled. Having the power issues is enough of a pain; the power issues leading to a whole window being shattered just feels like being kicked when you’re down. Who needs that?   Hopefully, this will all be fixed; I’ll try and report back on what the fixes are and how expensive, and, ideally, what Tesla service has to say about breaking windows to open doors."
7 Reasons Behind Tesla's Insane Customer Retention Rate - CarBuzz,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1QanM5ZjZmYy0zYkQ2WFlNSVhCbktvOG1Ya2tLQ1Z3SVN5Q0o0OWg3WFFKTTZsemt0WXVmUy1ZVzBQZ0p3M09rMmNMOFl4cDJENXQxQ25vcnQ0bnY2Q3JYQTBTUlYydDhucE9IQ2l4aGhxbFh6?oc=5,"Sun, 16 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Having built itself a loyal (some say cult-like) fanbase over the past decade and a half, Tesla now has the highest retention rate in the automotive industry, estimated to be at a sky-high 87%. High retention is a goal that most automakers spend their days chasing. In the past, people were more likely to stick to one car brand for life, but the modern market has made achieving brand loyalty more difficult, as people have a higher number of options and an increased ability to shop around thanks to the internet. So what exactly is the secret behind Tesla’s high retention rate? Here are a few reasons why Tesla owners keep coming back for more.                            Range, Without The Anxiety                   Range anxiety is one of the biggest issues consumers face when considering the purchase of an electric vehicle, especially for frequent long-distance drivers or people who live in areas where charging infrastructure is still not optimal.   Tesla’s vehicles have contributed to mitigating range anxiety. In the company’s own words, “Tesla vehicles can travel some of the longest driving ranges of any other production electric vehicle on the market."" Some cars in the Tesla lineup are available with standard and long-range battery pack configurations.         Related     These 10 cars are at the top in terms of range.           The longest estimated range in the 2024 lineup belongs to the Model S (402 miles). But even vehicles with a shorter range, such as the Standard Range Model 3, will drive for about 272 miles on one charge, which is more than enough for daily commuting or even a road trip without fear of being stranded on the side of the road.   The other aspect of Tesla ownership that has helped ease consumers’ range anxiety is the Supercharger network, with its wide availability of fast, reliable chargers (more on that later).                            The Supercharger Network                   Charging an electric car is a very different process compared to filling up at a gas station. With dozens of different charger types and payment apps, plus a still-developing infrastructure, making sure you always have enough juice to get to where you’re going can be a slightly daunting process. Tesla has worked to simplify this process with its Supercharger network, making it as quick, easy, and seamless as possible. Despite having a difficult start to 2024, experiencing its first drop in revenue since 2020 and consequently going through a mass layoff, the company is still investing in  expanding the Supercharger network , with a $500m cash injection aimed at creating new sites and expanding existing ones.   In fact, the Supercharger model is so good that  EVs from other brands  will shortly be able to use it as well, opening up thousands of chargers to non-Tesla vehicles. The path towards Supercharger adoption by other automakers hasn’t been smooth, with  delays expected  to push things forward until next year, but this is still a move that will dramatically accelerate the progress of EVs on the US automotive landscape.                            Groundbreaking So-Called Self-Driving                   Aside from bringing electric cars into the mainstream, Tesla’s other claim to fame is the development and progress of driver assistance technology; the company’s goal is to eventually achieve full self-driving abilities.   The current “Autopilot” package, often criticized due to its slightly misleading name, consists of a slightly more intelligent cruise control function paired with automatic steering (under ideal conditions, with a clearly marked lane).   The “Full Self-Driving Capability,” also  sporting a hyperbolic moniker , is a more advanced package that includes automatic lane change, automatic parking, and a “summoning” feature (which moves the car in and out of a tight space without the driver being inside it), plus traffic sign and traffic light identification (currently still in the testing phase).   That being said, the road towards self-driving Teslas has been anything but smooth. The company is currently  facing a lawsuit  regarding the “Full Self-Driving” functions, being accused of misleading its customers about what Teslas is really capable of on the autonomous driving front.                            Constant Over-The-Air Updates                   Access to over-the-air updates means you can  keep your Tesla up to date  and with all the latest features in the comfort of your own home without having to upgrade components or replace your vehicle every year.   Teslas’ onboard software received periodic updates to keep it running smoothly and efficiently, and comfort features such as heated seats can be activated remotely as well. Over-the-air updates are also used for more complex driving features such as autonomous capabilities, although Tesla has been  slightly more cautious  with that as of lately, making sure to emphasize the updates do not give your car fully autonomous capabilities due to complaints about the misleading nature of the “full self-driving” it had originally promised.                            Affordability: Electric Power For The People                   Tesla is often credited with bringing electric vehicles into the mainstream, and its prices reflect this. Electric motoring is now firmly within reach of the ordinary American family, with Tesla kickstarting the wave of affordable EVs hitting the market. When the company's very first model, the first-generation Roadster, made its debut in 2008, electric vehicles were still a rarity rather than a part of the everyday consumer's reality, and price tags were accordingly eye-watering. These days, things are different, partly thanks to Tesla.   If you are looking into buying a Tesla and have a spending limit of $50k, there are several options for joining the Tesla club on a budget. The Model 3 is the least expensive path into Tesla ownership, sitting just above the $40k mark at $38,990; the base Model Y isn’t far behind at $42,990. And that's before you subtract the sweet $7,500 tax credit from the government.                            Supercar Performance At A Budget Price                   Aside from the spaceship looks and the tech gizmos, Teslas are also known for their blistering performance, especially when it comes to acceleration. Even the slowest member of the family, the Model Y, can reach 60 mph in 3.5 seconds, and the fastest, the Model S Plaid, can reach 60 mph in under two seconds, which is beyond insane for something that, on the outside, looks like a fairly ordinary modern sedan.         Related     Planning an all-Tesla drag race? Here's what you can expect.            All this performance, however, does not come with a supercar-level price tag you would expect. The new  Model 3 Performance , with a 0-60 time a hair under three seconds and a top speed of 163 mph, is on sale starting at $53,990. This makes it over $10,000 cheaper than its rival electric sedan, the  BMW i5 , which is slower on both the acceleration and top speed fronts. Tesla is also responsible for bringing the possibility of owning a  1000 hp vehicle  to ordinary Americans, thanks to the Model S Plaid, the only car on the market with four-figure horsepower sitting under the $90k mark.                            It's Just Cool To Own A Tesla                   A big part of Tesla’s appeal, and part of what makes Tesla owners come back for more over and over again, is the company’s place in pop culture. Owner Elon Musk’s larger-than-life and frequently controversial figure has become inseparable from the brand itself; as a result, driving one of his cars has become synonymous with wealth, technological progress, and social clout. Bridging the gap between the world of cars and the world of tech with its sleek, futuristic aesthetic, Tesla has become the vehicle of choice for tech-bros, finance-bros, and anyone who simply wants to look cool.         Related     The man secured the future of EVs.           The same element of Tesla ownership that some people view as cult-like is seen as a selling point by others; driving a Tesla makes owners feel like they are a member of an exclusive club, somewhat removed from what Tesla fans refer to as “legacy automakers”. Thanks to the company’s Apple-esque approach to vehicle repair, as well as a separate charging network, owning a Tesla is less like owning a car and more like owning the latest status-symbol tech device. And much like with tech, once you are part of a brand’s ecosystem, you are likely to stick with it."

Elon Musk wins record-breaking Tesla pay deal from shareholders - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1ZcDJjS1FOQ0pIaFBvbTIzZURRVjJJMUxRUkZfRHFGX01BQVozbTlONmxqbV8wR3ItSTFIa2t0Q09Xc2JPTmZkbWhoTDVOT21ydXNtTVJZNUcxZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5ldXBOUlRxNDBrOFgwU3R4emJyZTJzVGV2d1d5YmpQaEtreEFfNGJyQXhMelRpMVc4X09hRGk4X2lXNUdiQ29wcEp4QUZLM0dOdnhNcTFtbWxoNXNDbjZZ?oc=5,"Fri, 14 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla shareholders have backed a record-breaking pay package for boss Elon Musk and approved a plan to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas. The deal was blocked earlier this year by a judge in Delaware over concerns it was unfair to shareholders. The vote is a victory for the multi-billionaire, who had campaigned fiercely for the payout, which is worth up to $56bn (£43.9bn). The exact amount depends on the Tesla share price. ""Hot damn, I love you guys,"" he told a crowd of enthusiastic shareholders who had gathered in Texas for the firm's annual meeting. The deal is worth more than 300 times what the top-earning boss in the US made last year, and more than 3,000 times the average CEO's pay package. However, the vote is not binding and legal experts have said it is not clear if the court that blocked the deal will accept the re-vote and allow the company to restore the pay package. ""The vote changes nothing,"" said Mathieu Shapiro, a managing partner at law firm Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel. ""It only offers Tesla opportunities to try to use the vote to obtain a better decision going forward. “It will be interesting to see if another court is willing to credit a vote taken after the trial court’s decision.” The eye-popping sum had sparked criticism and raised concerns that the board of Tesla was too submissive and close to Mr Musk.  In the January court ruling , Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled the sum was ""unfair"" and the process for determining the package, by a board dominated by Mr Musk, was ""deeply flawed"". Chancellor McCormick had pointed out that Antonio Gracias, who had been a board director at Tesla, had ""the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis"".  She also highlighted Todd Maron, Tesla's former general counsel, ""who was Musk’s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition"". Mr Musk announced that he wanted to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas after the court in Delaware, where it is currently incorporated, voided his pay package, siding with a small investor who had sued over the deal. The fight over the plan had aired concerns about Mr Musk's leadership, at a time when Tesla's share price has fallen from its height and its position in the electric car industry is under pressure. But Mr Musk rallied his fan base in support of the deal, appealing particularly to individual investors, who make up an unusually large portion of the firm's shareholder base. The pay proposal received 72% of the votes cast, similar to the 73% total in 2018, when it was first approved. ""It's a pretty ringing endorsement,"" said car industry analyst Karl Brauer. Mr Musk got more than enough shareholder support ""to justify the package,"" he added. Mr Musk had previewed the results in a post on his social media company, X, formerly known as Twitter. Shares in the company closed up nearly 3% after Mr Musk's announcement. The compensation plan gives Mr Musk rights to roughly 300 million shares - the equivalent to a 10% stake in the firm -   as a reward for Tesla meeting a number of goals set out in 2018 which are linked to sales, profits and the share price. Tesla had said that Mr Musk's goals were challenging. However, the original lawsuit that led to the Delaware court blocking the pay deal alleged that the targets were the same as internal growth projections that were being shared with banks.  ""My understanding is that there's been about 1,100% appreciation in Tesla stock. And that's pretty, pretty impressive. Most chief executives have never done anything like that,"" said Mr Brauer. On whether Mr Musk deserved such a large pay aware, Georg Ell, former director of Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme: ""If I was an investor who put a substantial amount of money into this in 2018 and had held it throughout the period, I’d be very happy because I would have seen anywhere between... 13 and 16 times my money back.  ""That’s a very, very good return,"" he said. Mr Ell disclosed that he has a small shareholding in Tesla, worth around £6,000. Tesla's board said Mr Musk deserved the package because the carmaker had achieved its targets under his leadership and that it was necessary to ensure he remains dedicated to the company. Mr Ell said that the result of the vote gives Mr Musk ""a very strong validation"" ""At Tesla of course he doesn’t do it all alone but he definitely sets the agenda, he sets the pace and he is a relentless person to work for, there’s no doubt about that,"" he said. Tesla executives expressed support for the package in social media posts, saying that Mr Musk was crucial to the company's success.  Meanwhile, Mr Musk promised a personal tour of Tesla's factory in Texas to some shareholders who cast votes. Shareholders also approved the re-election of two board members at the meeting on Thursday: James Murdoch, the son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, and Mr Musk's brother Kimbal Musk."

This article presents 4 sections: Example Bear and Bull Outcomes Updates To ARK’s 2023 Tesla Model Business Opportunities Not Included In The Model Risks And Limits Of Our Model Example Bear and Bull Outcomes We do not provide a single bull or bear case, because we dimension their outcomes as the 75th and 25th percentile output from the simulation. Nonetheless, the table below presents what are plausible forecasts for each case.  Example Outputs for Bear and Bull Outcomes  Example Output*  2023 Actual Example Bear Outcome 2029  Example Bull Outcome 2029  Cars Sold (Millions) 1.8 5.8 14.4 Electric Vehicle Revenue (Billions) $81 $250 $394 Autonomous Ride-hail Revenue (Net, Billions)  $- $603 $951 Total Gross Margin**  18% 56% 53% Total EBITDA Margin** 17% 32% 32% Enterprise Value/EBITDA  39 16.8 18.1 Market Cap (Billions)  $540 $7,000 $10,900 Share Price and CAGR***  $170 $2,000 (56%) $3,100 (69%) Free Cash Flow Yield 1.50% 4.30% 4.10% Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2024. In the table above, we share examples of two possible scenarios that correspond with our bear and bull price targets. Please note, however, that there are multiple outcomes within our million simulations that could correspond with the bull and bear price targets. *Note: Figures are rounded for simplicity and consistent with reasonable variance in the forecast. 2023 Market Cap and Enterprise Value/EBITDA is as of June 11, 2024. **Note: The similarity in bear and bull example EBITDA margins and total gross margins reflects our view of the most plausible economics of the two scenarios. In the bear case, Tesla doesn’t scale as aggressively and can remain at a higher price point for longer, which benefits its margin structure. In the bull case, the gross margins and EBITDA margins on Tesla’s electric vehicle business decline as it sells into lower priced car segments, offset by the ride-hailing business lines, which make up a larger percentage of profits. ***Note: CAGRs as of 6/11/24 for two possible scenarios that correspond with our bear and bull price targets. Please note, however, that there are multiple outcomes within our million simulations that could correspond with the bull and bear price targets.  This forecast relies on data that have not been verified, and are subject to numerous criteria, assumptions, risks, and limitations that are inherently uncertain, and there will be variations with real life that could cause substantially different results. The forecast includes assumptions on gross margin and capital efficiency, and certain other metrics, which are subject to change or revisions over time, which are influenced by ARK’s subjective judgments and biases that heighten the risks and limit the uses of the forecast as a decision-making tool. Given the unpredictable nature of markets and other future events, relying on forecasts is inherently risky.

Note that in cases where robotaxis do not launch, Tesla could launch a human-driven ride-hail service for both strategic and tactical reasons, as we have analyzed  previously . 2 From a modeling perspective, we previously estimated that Tesla’s take rate would be ~40-60% on average, higher than Uber’s ~20-30% take rate. 3  This year, we fine-tuned our analysis to include the assumption that, initially, Tesla will own and operate its vehicle network, retaining all revenue per mile for the first one-to-three years. For later years, we assume that third-party companies will own and maintain the vehicle fleet, earning ~$0.20 per mile for their services, while the remainder of revenue per mile accrues to Tesla. In effect, Tesla’s take rate is ~80% on average in the final year of the model. Meanwhile, we revised our median case expectation for the start of a robotaxi service to late 2025.  While we pushed back our median launch date for Tesla’s robotaxi service by one year, we remain confident that the service will launch within the next five years. With the release of Full Self-Driving (FSD) v12, Tesla transitioned to a neural network that learns from video data and directly controls the vehicle, eliminating over 300,000 lines of manual code. 4  This update has enabled human-like—and in some instances zero-intervention driving 5 —by leveraging Tesla’s significant data advantage, which now exceeds 1.3 billion cumulative FSD miles. 6  According to our research, Tesla is accumulating data at ~110x the rate of Waymo, as shown below.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any particular security. Furthermore, our research suggests that a Tesla in FSD mode is ~5X safer than a human-driven Tesla, as shown below, and ~16X safer than the average car on the road, also shown below. No longer constrained by AI training compute, 7  Tesla's accelerated software updates are enhancing performance and safety. 8  As a result, Tesla should be able to demonstrate superior, statistically significant safety metrics and receive regulatory approval for its ro"

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

This decision breathes new life into a lawsuit previously dismissed last November.   U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled on Monday that Tesla owners could proceed with their case, attempting to prove that Tesla coerced them into paying exorbitant prices and enduring long waits for vehicle repairs under the threat of losing warranty coverage. The owners argue that this alleged coercion violates both federal and California antitrust laws.   Thompson cited evidence   suggesting Tesla’s control over the repairs market. Specifically, she pointed to Tesla’s alleged failure to open a sufficient number of authorized service centers and its design of vehicles that necessitate diagnostic and software updates exclusively available from Tesla. Furthermore, she highlighted evidence of a parts monopoly, including Tesla’s restrictions on original equipment manufacturers, limiting their sales to entities other than Tesla. Additionally, Tesla allegedly only sold parts to consumers on a limited basis.   Read more:  EU Investigates Unfair Subsidies for Tesla, BMW and Renault   The judge also found potential evidence of illegal “tying” practices, wherein Tesla’s control over various markets allegedly forced customers into unwanted purchases.   Tesla and its legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. They have previously argued that the lawsuit was based on an “illogical theory,” claiming that Tesla would not deliberately degrade its repairs and parts services as it would harm its more lucrative vehicle sales and leasing business.   Matt Ruan, an attorney representing the plaintiff owners, expressed satisfaction with the court’s decision, describing it as well-reasoned and thoughtful. He stated that they look forward to the next phase of the case.   This lawsuit consolidates five separate complaints from vehicle owners who have paid for Tesla repairs and parts since March 2019. The plaintiffs allege that Tesla, headquartered in Austin, Texas, differs from its competitors by insisting on handling all servicing and parts needs internally, rather than allowing owners to use independent repair shops and third-party parts.

Shareholders voted with the board recommendations on nearly every proposal, including approving CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation package and reincorporating from Delaware to Texas. We see no reason to change our outlook for the firm after the vote. Accordingly, we maintain our fair value estimate of $200 per share and narrow moat rating. Tesla shares rallied the day of the vote, as Musk announced on X (formerly Twitter) that his 2018 compensation package would likely pass. We think the market was responding to the reduction of key person risk, since Musk may have potentially reevaluated his role at Tesla if the compensation package did not pass. While we think Musk’s departure would initially cause its stock to fall, we don’t believe Tesla needs him as much as it once did; thanks to its deep management roster, it should continue to meet its strategic priorities. These include rolling out a new more affordable vehicle, developing full self-driving autonomous software, and implementing cost reductions to boost profit margins. We view Tesla shares as slightly undervalued, trading a little less than 10% below our fair value estimate, but in 3-star territory. We recommend investors wait for a larger margin of safety before considering an entry point. The vote does not necessarily mean Musk’s compensation package, which a Delaware judge invalidated, will be reinstated. However, Tesla may appeal the ruling, and a higher court could consider the 2024 shareholder vote in its decision.

He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

The Lidar U-Turn: Elon Musk’s “Fool’s Errand” Becomes Tesla’s Secret Weapon - CDOTrends,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQMWpqNm1vVGdyRU1WSTY2SnJMbUZ1aEkwMm5oMElSQVFsbFhKZDN5YUlkX0FPSWd3dEowaXJwWEZxckJtY3JhLVg3enhLb2lRanJ3T20tSEhOUUdJNnRsTUVPQVMzQS1aRGx4N212QldBWDZhNXEzRkkzeHRsa1RZMDBXTjVXa3Rmd0kweVFaTXpXS053TEZ6b2xtcFhXcGd6c0hrQw?oc=5,"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","When Tesla boss Elon Musk attacked Lidar technology’s use of in-vehicle navigation as a “fool’s errand” back in 2019, this was seen as a major setback for the future use of the technology. Musk’s continued comments on Lidar have been quoted many times. In 2020 he said that its use in cars was “freaking stupid.” “It’s expensive and unnecessary,” he said. “You have expensive hardware that’s worthless on the car.”   Lidar stands for light detection and ranging, and while it was invented in the 1960s with the invention of lasers, it was in the development of autonomous vehicles that many hoped the technology would come into its own. Negative comments from the leader of a visionary company that was also leading the world of autonomous vehicles were not what Lidar technology needed. Tide is turning A few years later, however, it was quietly revealed that Tesla had become the biggest customer of  Luminar , a major Lidar manufacturer. The Luminar earnings report released in May showed that Tesla contributed over 10% of the company’s first quarter 2024 revenues, totaling more than USD2 million. Those numbers are not huge, but they could indicate that the tide is turning in Lidar’s favor. “The emergence of Lidar in the lower-priced segments reflects the rapid fall in the cost of the technology.” According to a recent report from analysts  IDTechEx , the global market for automotive Lidar will reach USD9.5 billion by 2034, representing a CAGR of 19.5% compared with 2024. It is not just the automotive industry that is using Lidar now. Alongside the longstanding deployment of radar, Lidar is now finding some military applications with commercial implications. Lidar systems mounted on drones, piloted aircraft and ground vehicles assist in target identification and tracking. They deliver accurate distance measurements and detailed imagery, which help distinguish between objects, such as enemy personnel and equipment. Civilian drones are also developing as a promising Lidar market. Japanese company  Kudan  announced in June that its SLAM lidar technology had been incorporated into the Terra Lidar Dual, launched by drone solutions provider  Terra Drone . This deal integrated the laser technology developed for drones by Terra Drone, making it possible to switch between ground and airborne measurements with a single device. It also enables the SLAM Lidars to take measurements where drones cannot fly, such as under bridges, and integrate the data with the UAV laser. Another positive development for Lidar is from tech giant Apple, which uses the technology in its iPhone cameras beginning with the 12 series introduced in 2020. Lidar helps the camera take sharper photos, especially in dark conditions. The scanner also taps into augmented reality to combine the real and virtual worlds. Chinese automakers lead the charge Tesla is not the only player turning to Lidar in the car industry. In 2023, more new cars were released with Lidar technology than in the previous four years, with Chinese manufacturers leading the charge. Chinese manufacturers are set to release around 128 models with Lidar this year, according to analysts at the  Yole Group . “This makes it a far bigger market than Europe, where around 10 new car models are expected to be released, and the US with only two,” says Yole Group analysis. Price, which has historically been Elon Musk’s bugbear, is also coming down. Yole says that the average selling price for Chinese cars with Lidar is around USD450-500, a sharp decrease in 2022, while the price in the rest of the world averages between USD700-1000. The global Lidar market for passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and robotaxis was estimated at USD538 million in 2023, representing a 79% year-on-year increase. Right now, more passenger cars are being manufactured with Lidar than robotaxis, but this segment is set to grow, and that gap will decrease over time, representing another growth market. At least three car platforms with Lidar are likely to be released by Japanese and South Korean OEMs in 2024 or soon after. “The emergence of Lidar in the lower-priced segments reflects the rapid fall in the cost of the technology because if you have a lower price for the car, then all the equipment is much more cost-sensitive,” said Pierrick Boulay, senior analyst at Yole Group. All of this shows that with some technologies, it takes time to mature, but growth can take off rapidly when they find their moment. In Australia, QR code technology was never a thing before the COVID-19 lockdowns; now, it is everywhere. Hollywood star Hedy Lamarr developed Bluetooth technology and filed a patent in 1941, but it is only in recent decades that it has become one of the bedrocks of connectivity. At one time, Elon Musk was a fierce critic of Lidar. Now he’s installing it, although he has yet to come out with a ringing endorsement. We’re still waiting for that.  Image credit: iStockphoto/ Frank Armstrong"
Reviewing The Tesla Cybertruck Is Totally Pointless - The Autopian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOcERnMDRSSHFKTXk2Q1dQV2xnTzRIUUlrcUlqV2x5WnFaaDVDbnlTWW1Kc1lBNU96WVdqalQyTmtPSHF6eUo2T2V6ZS1pWUFFaVhCTGNrNWtLano3aVJCcXlLMksxbEFWNmlEYWZIVjkzS21VUWtkYWoxYjA3dTRodHhlbUpxQW8?oc=5,"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","I just wrote what I intended to be a measured review of the  Tesla Cybertruck . I simply drove the machine and wrote down my thoughts. My review pointed out the truck’s flaws and ultimately concluded that I think it’s “cool” despite its controversial founder. That may sound like the most lukewarm take in automotive media history, but even it was enough to cause people to go  absolutely   crazy . 442 comments (and counting)!   I initially wondered “How  are  you supposed to write about the Cybertruck these days without people getting upset?” I’ve concluded that the answer is: You can’t. The Tesla Cybertruck should be renamed the Tesla Powderkeg, and reviewing it is totally pointless.     The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   I’m exhausted by the comments sections of my  Tesla Cybertruck review . Readers are pissed. YouTube viewers are pissed. Twitter/x users are pissed. Your neighbor’s dog that just laid a mound on your lawn probably did so because it was pissed. Everyone is pissed! And I don’t like it; I want people (and dogs) to be happy. I want them to enjoy their Sunday, not spend it banging away at a keyboard arguing with people.   But like I said, folks were LIVID the other day. “spooky cartoon spider-man,” in particular, let me HAVE IT on Twitter:     Do I think ripping on such a handsome devil’s looks because said HD called a truck cool is a great way to spend a Sunday? Not at all! Go outside! Throw that dog a frisbee so it doesn’t shit on your lawn again!   To be sure, I get  why  everyone is pissed. The Cybertruck’s primary proponent, Elon Musk, is a ridiculous person who has offended numerous groups, including ones that have already been marginalized. That’s a big deal, and it’s good that people take that seriously. But if you’re going to promote social unity/fairness, you gotta practice what you preach! That’s the thing about the Cybertruck and my review; it turned people who are normally nice and rational, and who regularly speak up to preserve civil discourse and dignity, into that which they denounce.   There are plenty of parallels to the current political situation. You have one group that believes that you  must  actively and endlessly hate someone or you yourself are condoning all of the bad things they’ve ever done (one commenter even wrote “There are some people (myself included) that consider Musk a large enough problem that they will  judge a persons character when that persons uses or praises his work.”  For reference, Tesla sells half a million cars annually in the U.S.). And then you have the other group that worships that person and thinks that anyone who slightly criticizes him is an ignorant hater.   While I think both groups — those who love Tesla and those who loathe it — have good intentions, oftentimes neither can think clearly. One is blinded by hatred, one is blinded by admiration; it really is a tale as old as time.     As such, writing my review was pointless. Solely because I called the Cybertruck “cool,” people are throwing tomatoes and soiled underpants at me and my beautiful, carefully crafted words, saying the writing is somehow “flawed” and that I wrote it solely for “clicks.” Clicks?! THE AUDACITY.       To be a bit more serious: I’m sympathetic to these folks. They are commenters on this site, and I’m grateful they’re here — even the ones who make fun of my looks. At the very least, they are purporting to be standing up against bad things Musk has said. To them, they are championing for a better, more civil, more accepting world, and that’s what we should all want. Does being mean online help their cause? Probably not, but the anonymity provided by the web often ends this way.   But it’s not just the haters, it’s also the lovers.     They believe Musk is saving the world, and in some ways, he’s definitely helped! He’s pushed the world towards electrification, which will end up having huge positive climate change implications (a macho Cybertruck to lure folks away from fuel-sucking SuperDuties could help, too). He’s changed the way the world does space exploration with SpaceX. And he’s done a bunch of other great things, but as was the case before when talking about his flaws, no matter what I say here, I’ll get criticized for not mentioning all of what he’s done. Suffice it to say: He’s done some amazing things in addition to the dumb things he’s said and done.   So when Musk fans see all the compromises I mention in my review and say things like “It’s a dumb, poorly disguised ‘hit piece’ peppered with ads. Don’t waste your time. Zero real insight,” I’m sympathetic. They want Musk to succeed — to sell lots of trucks, so he can save the universe.   I don’t think either group has bad intentions (and we here at The Autopian are totally cool with both writing in the comments section (in a civilized way) their strong opinions about the truck or Musk). I think the problem is that there are only two vocal groups. This is the world we live in today; it’s black or white, and there is little nuance. As a result, people in both groups are allowing the topic to get the best of them, and neither group is going to actually read a Cybertruck review with an open mind, making my endeavor to write one — as previously stated — thoroughly  pointless .   Maybe I Should Have Included In My Review Every Single Good And Bad Thing Elon Musk Has Ever Done   Lord knows I’m fallible. While I did point out that the truck cannot be disconnected from highly controversial CEO Elon Musk, some folks felt I should have criticized Musk more. They wanted me to make a special exception for this vehicle review and add a paragraph about the transgressions of the CEO of the company that built the truck.   I personally think that pointing out that people have big feelings about Musk is enough, especially given that The Autopian (and everyone) has written ad nauseam about Musk and his foolish words/actions. I’ve never seen a car review spend that much time focusing on the transgressions of a company exec; plus, I know Elon proponents would have demanded that I add another paragraph of all the good stuff Elon has done. Should I do this for all cars? When I write about Lucid, exactly how many paragraphs do I need to commit to the Saudi Royal Family and the murder of  Jamal Khashoggi? If I write a VW review, do I need to talk about Dieselgate? Should reviewers of the Ford Model A and VW Beetle have included paragraph-long asides in their reviews about Henry Ford’s nasty prejudices and the Third Reich, respectively?   [ Editor’ Note:  I feel sort of compelled to step in at this point, because I’ve been separating the terrible people who ran the companies of the cars I’ve loved from the cars themselves for pretty much all my life. That’s what happens when you’re a Jew who loves VW Beetles, like me. At some point, you just have to let the car be the car. This I suppose can bleed into the idea of separating the art from the artist, which I think generally I tend to do as well, though there’s always some point of too far or too much. Or at least, there can be. It’s blurry, and I think at this moment we’re in an era where no one wants to see gradients or shades, everything is all or nothing, so you either hate the Cybertruck with the heat of a thousand suns or love it with the heat of an equal and opposite number of suns. But that’s not how reality works.   We’re going to be deeply fucked if we, collectively can’t get past this. Not everything is pure good or pure evil, but we can always try to keep our eyes on being as good as we can to as many people as we can, and if that means that sometimes we accept that people will find a truck cool even if the guy whose company sells it is a steaming pile, then maybe that’s not the worst thing. I’ve never seen car fandom/hatedom quite like this ever before, and I sincerely hope this is an inane phase we’ll get past, because at this moment, we all seem kind of nuts. – JT]   No one is objective, and not everyone writes from my perspective, but my perspective is that Elon Musk is a lot of things both good and bad, but he’s definitely a bit of an edgelord with some awful takes and even awful-er communication skills. And because of his megaphone, those are indeed a big deal. My perspective is also that people care about the Cybertruck, and I care about trucks, and I want to know how the truck drives. Doing so, and communicating it in a cogent, uncontaminated way, is my job.   And I have to believe that what some people want  is  a car review without politics. I’m not saying “stick to sports,” as we write often about politics, and the larger world has to be considered when talking about Tesla — but how much throat-clearing is enough throat-clearing? It is, in a way, absurd to assume that anyone reading a review in The Autopian doesn’t already know about Elon Musk and hasn’t already formed an opinion about him.     Think about how many Tesla Model Ys are sold each year (I’m using this example because loads of them are already out; you likely know somebody who owns one) — roughly a quarter million. The people buying that car just want a good, clean, fun-to-drive, cheap-to-operate car. LOADs of people who drive a Model Y are not Elon Musk supporters. And when they read a review, they want a review — they already know about Elon and his weirdness. They want to know what the reviewer thinks of the Model Y so that they can make an informed purchase. While I suspect Cybertruck shoppers are a bit more opinionated on Musk’s antics than Model Y owners given the polarizing nature of the truck, many — and I’d guess the majority —  just think it looks cool, and want to know what it’s like to drive. “It’s only a ’cause’ to you. To me, it’s a truck that does what I need it to do,” writes Cybertruck owner Loudog in the comments of my article. “It’s my money. I had an F-150 I daily drove before this (A Powerboost. Excellent truck but too m"
Tesla Factory is Ordered to Fix Toxic Emissions. It's Got Over a Year to Do It - KQED,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPYUtadlpmVTA2OTJHQ1BWSTluVWNNQlY5QjQxM1ZVODI3dzVTZTJjWFZhSEJtTVl1X2V6VjBKcV9qVHc3d01vNm55MDdON1FtamZ0MEc0M0h2czd3SVhqd01wWVRDQzdtWlg5Qy1qeWh1Z2U0NWhZck8yeVZGRzFqOGc3RTM5azNrSVpSa09pbV9vcXlIc3Y1SWNsdG52U0hiaEtPMXppWnF4eklCQWZLcnNOUEQzUmxJ?oc=5,"Thu, 27 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","According to the air quality district, the releases have stemmed from equipment malfunctions in the Tesla plant’s two paint shops, where the auto bodies and components for the hundreds of thousands of vehicles the facility produces each year are spray-coated.   Most of the malfunctions have involved systems designed to prevent the release of pollutants from the paint shops. The air district’s complaint also notes that releases sometimes occur even when the anti-pollution systems are operating normally.   Failures anywhere in the factory’s production line, “such as vehicles crashing into one another when they are not properly overseen by Tesla staff,” can result in an automatic shutdown of the pollution-abatement systems “even if the abatement equipment is still working properly,” according to the complaint.   The air agency’s order gives Tesla a maximum of about 15 months to retain an engineering firm and devise a process to stop all toxic emissions from the paint shops except in emergencies when releases may be unavoidable. Once the air district signs off on the plan, the company will have six more months to implement it.   Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order.   The air district’s case is the second major pollution action against the automaker this year.   In February, district attorneys in 25 California counties  sued the company  for mishandling hazardous waste at dozens of facilities across the state, including the Fremont plant.   The lawsuit filed in San Joaquin County said Tesla improperly discarded toxic materials — including batteries, fuel and paint — in Dumpsters or at landfills not permitted to accept hazardous waste.   The company settled that case for $1.5 million."

Tesla shareholder vote on Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package heats up - NBC News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxObzRTLVJnRTZ4RHcySGlQbzhxNXZjYlBESjllYXRFMnE1SmtfdkhqRFpNc3hEMDQ5MkladC0zSDdKYXdxdmw5MkdWRHZheVlLLXlOWFk2ZjUwRDd4U1lIYkctZWRPRGIzWjRwcW5Ya2xrS0JUMkV5Nld0SkVOTTJlbVpYSGlBUkFmTFoyd2Qwbk8xbUpfOHBiR25JRU9KemhJ0gFWQVVfeXFMTlNpU284QW51aFNFNFdRNTZ3cWJqTTBVOThJaTdReFZHdDQwWVJCVjlZdzdDRGh2WFV1cDhqNFNwcHNGRDlHWGN2UlJlU1k5WXBfbG81TUE?oc=5,"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 07:00:00 GMT","It may be the highest-stakes popularity contest in history.  Friends and foes of tech billionaire Elon Musk are nearing the end of a two-month battle over whether to reinstate a record $56 billion pay package for the Tesla CEO, months after a Delaware state judge  struck down his compensation  as improperly awarded. The fight is in the form of a shareholder vote: Nearly all owners of Tesla stock, including Wall Street firms and thousands of individual investors, are casting ballots for or against the pay package, voting mostly online ahead of the automaker’s annual meeting Thursday in Austin, Texas. Voting began in April, and the final votes are expected in person at Thursday’s meeting.  The question before shareholders: whether to bless a pay package that they originally approved in 2018 but that the Delaware judge deemed illegal under that state’s corporate laws.  The vote is unusual not only because of the fortune that Musk stands to gain — it’s 250 times larger than the median among Musk’s peers,  according to the judge  who voided it in January — but also because of the public and private jockeying on both sides of the pay vote. Tesla  has bought advertisements  and  launched a website  to try to sway investors to vote for the package — tactics that experts say are unheard of in a debate about a corporate executive’s pay. Some Musk backers are also making online videos and reaching out to potential swing voters one on one, as if it were an election for public office. The vote appeared to be going down to the wire this week, with shareholders announcing their votes in press releases and on social media. Investing magazine Barron’s predicted, based on an informal survey of analysts, that the pay deal  was “likely” to win  the majority needed for approval.  Musk is aiming to capitalize on his popularity among individual Tesla investors. He said Saturday  on his social media app X  that about 90% of retail shareholders who had voted by then voted in favor of the massive paycheck.  But opponents of Musk’s compensation deal have been organizing, too. Several investors released a joint letter last month urging fellow shareholders  to vote down the package  as excessive, and large institutional investors including a  Norwegian sovereign wealth fund  and  California pension fund  announced in recent days that they are opposed.  Two influential companies that advise investors on proxy votes, ISS and Glass Lewis, also  weighed in against the pay package , which they opposed the first time around in 2018.  The vote is a test of investors’ continued faith in Musk, who has become an increasingly polarizing public figure especially because of  his extreme views , including on immigration and  transgender issues . One of the world’s wealthiest people, he maintains a base of loyal fans. James Park, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said investors are likely thinking about an array of factors in deciding whether to reward Musk for his performance as CEO. “It’ll be partly a popularity contest, but I think the shareholders will also do a hard-nosed rational calculus about whether it’s worth paying this sum to ensure he doesn’t go somewhere else,” he said. Musk has all but  threatened to abandon Tesla  if he doesn’t get additional shares in the company. In January, he  posted on X  that he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla” if he didn’t have 25% voting control of the company. As of January, he had about 13% of the company,  according to CNBC . Musk’s attention is already divided. He’s also the CEO of rocket company SpaceX, the owner of X and a co-founder of brain science startup Neuralink. Last year,  he founded  an artificial intelligence firm, xAI.  The amount of money at stake is massive even by Musk’s standards. He has a net worth of about $200 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , so the package is equal to more than a quarter of his wealth. Musk was never paid the money: By the time the package was voided, he had stock options equivalent to 304 million Tesla shares but had not yet exercised the options to acquire them, according to the Delaware ruling. Tesla shareholders approved the pay package in 2018, with compensation tied to Tesla’s performance including its market value. There was dissent even then, with 73% of votes in favor compared to a typical 95% approval level for corporate CEO pay,  Reuters reported . To some of Musk’s critics, the vote on whether to reinstate the $56 billion package is a brazen attempt to get around the ruling of Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick. She ruled in favor of a handful of Tesla shareholders who argued the pay was unfair in part because the board that approved it was  too close to Musk to be entirely independent  and shareholders were unaware of all the facts. “At least as to this transaction, Musk controlled Tesla,” McCormick  wrote in her ruling . The situation is far from a textbook model of how to run a major corporation, said Nadya Malenko, a finance professor at Boston College’s school of management. “These are not good examples of governance,” she said, pointing to the conflicts and lack of transparency brought to light in the Delaware litigation. After the Delaware ruling, lawyers for the plaintiff shareholders  asked the judge  to award what would be a record $6 billion in attorney’s fees for winning the case. The judge hasn’t ruled on that request, and Tesla’s board said in a proxy statement that a fee award may not be warranted if shareholders reapprove the compensation package. A Tesla Supercharger location in Santa Monica, Calif., on May 15. Patrick T. Fallon / AFP - Getty Images Musk and the board say they plan to appeal McCormick’s ruling, and they’re hoping a second vote will, in effect, override McCormick’s concerns about the pay package. The board is also separately asking shareholders to approve moving Tesla’s state of incorporation to Texas. But it’s far from clear that a second shareholder vote will pass court muster, said Ann Lipton, a Tulane University law professor. She said even if a majority of shareholders vote “yes,” there will almost certainly be further litigation in Delaware — meaning the case will go on. “This just hasn’t been done before,” Lipton said, calling the whole matter unprecedented. “This idea of, after a trial, after a finding of a violation of fiduciary duty, to have a vote again — I’m unaware of anything like this happening before.” From a legal standpoint, Lipton said, corporate boards are supposed to maximize shareholder value, and it’s unclear how the pay package benefits shareholders in a tangible way. The $56 billion would be back pay covering a period since 2018 during which Musk has already done his job, and if it were framed as a bonus or a gift, a court still might rule it unreasonable, she said. “Gifts are nice. Gifts are fine. But a gift of corporate assets with no corresponding benefit falls into the legal category of ‘waste,’” she  wrote in a blog post . Some of Musk’s supporters say that despite the Delaware ruling, they see the 2018 pay package as a promise that Tesla should follow through on as long as Musk holds up his end of the bargain by meeting the package’s performance goals. “A deal is a deal,” several investors have posted on Musk’s social media app X, alongside screenshots of confirmation that they voted and the hashtag #VotedTesla24. The performance requirements set in 2018 were based on three factors: Tesla’s market capitalization, revenue and profitability. Musk has met some of those, growing market capitalization — a measure of the company’s value — from $59.1 billion in 2018 to  more than $570 billion  this year. And he still has time to meet goals he hasn’t reached, including on revenue, because the pay package had a 10-year term. In the  440-page proxy statement  explaining the vote, a committee of the Tesla board noted the “novel circumstances.” It recommended approval to “avoid further uncertainty regarding Mr. Musk’s compensation and motivation.” The committee wrote that it couldn’t predict the eventual court outcome if some shareholders challenged the vote. The shareholder voting process is complicated enough that some Musk fans made how-to videos and posted them on X. Some shareholders could vote on their own online, while others had to do so through a broker. One Musk fan, using the handle @TeslaBoomerMama on X, was asking shareholders to fill out a form for assistance if they run into any difficulties voting. It’s the kind of public and private jockeying that sometimes occurs when there’s a contested election for corporate board seats — as there was this year  for the Disney board of directors  — but not when the issue is compensation. So far, many institutional investors aren’t saying how they voted or will vote. One top-10 shareholder, T. Rowe Price, has expressed some support but stopped short of announcing a vote in favor. “We do not think it’s fair to set out a new set of options subject to a fresh set of performance hurdles. The requirements of the 2018 package were extraordinarily ambitious — and they were delivered,” the firm wrote in a letter to Tesla’s board, according to the proxy statement. But T. Rowe Price told NBC News last month that it was premature to say how the company’s funds would vote. The firm didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was among the institutional investors  signing a joint letter  opposed, along with union-owned Amalgamated Bank. “Shareholders should not pretend that this award has any kind of incentivizing effect — it does not. What it does have is an excessiveness problem, which has been glaringly apparent from the start,” they wrote. The shareholder votes aren’t public unless an investor shares how they voted. Some people began sharing screenshots of their votes in April, shortly after the Tesla board announced the vote, "

The crowd at the meeting in Austin, Texas, cheered after the announcement, according to the livestream of the event.  Ehrhart also said shareholders voted to move Tesla’s corporate home to Texas from Delaware, fleeing the state where  most big companies are incorporated , after Musk said Delaware’s court system was “ broken .”  The win for Musk came on the shoulders of Tesla’s individual investors, who Musk said backed him by a wide margin, in contrast to some institutional investors who criticized his pay. He used his account on X, where he has 187 million followers,  to rally support among retail investors  and criticize those who opposed him, such as a Norwegian sovereign wealth fund.  But the fight over the $56 billion isn’t over. The Delaware judge who struck down Musk’s compensation in January is likely to be asked to rule on whether the latest shareholder vote was fair under the state’s business laws.

She found that it was 250 times larger than the median pay among Musk’s peers.  Musk has argued that he has worked without pay for years because he had yet to exercise any of the stock options and that he would have to hold the shares for five years before he could sell them.

In a ruling this week in the US Northern District Court of California, district judge Trina Thompson said that the case dating back to March last year could move forward.   The class action lawsuit claims that Tesla violated the law by tying repairs and parts exclusively to Tesla purchases, thereby prohibiting vehicle owners from using third-party repair shops or seeking aftermarket parts.   In March 2023,  two proposed class action lawsuits  were launched addressing the limited repair rights of Tesla owners. These cases alleged that Tesla caused ""owners to suffer lengthy delays in repairing or maintaining their EVs, only to pay supracompetitive prices for those parts and repairs once they are finally provided."" They were among a number of similar cases the court consolidated in June 2023.       However, in November last year, the judge dismissed the cases. The following month, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with seven claims.   In  a ruling this week  [PDF], the judge found the plaintiffs had ""plausibly alleged a cause of action for monopolization"" relating to one claim – that Tesla's practices violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act for Unlawful Tying, where services are used as a tying product. Tying is a term under monopoly law that suggests an agreement between a seller and a buyer means the buyer must buy certain other products, and not alternative products.   The right to repair movement has exerted growing influence across the tech and related sectors. Last month, the US state of Colorado  introduced  what it claimed to be the ""best in the world"" repair law.   Meanwhile, the EU  has adopted a right to repair  directive making fixing goods more accessible and cost-effective, although it still needs formal approval.   Apple has bowed to pressure to  begin supporting iPhone repairs with used parts . ®"

David Swanson | Reuters Elon Musk  says he can grow  Tesla  into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from  Nvidia  to build up its infrastructure. On Tesla’s  first-quarter earnings  call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also  wrote  in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.” But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter. Tesla shares slipped as much as 1% on the news Tuesday morning. By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. “Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.” A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic  layoffs  and warned that head-count reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory. The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital. A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Critics have said Musk is  only a part-time CEO  of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023. X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a  post on X in November , Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot Grok, CNBC has learned. Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services. While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S.,   according to the  Axios Harris Poll 100 survey , which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” Tesla’s stock price is down 29%   this year. Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla,  Musk has been  encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network. “If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,”  Musk said  on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.” To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from  Google ,  Amazon ,  Meta ,  Microsoft , OpenAI and others. ‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’ Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker  reported  its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth. Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?” In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla. Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, March 19, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies. At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a  $500 million  “Dojo” supercomputer in  Buffalo, New York , and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in  Austin, Texas . The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles. At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February. The memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It   noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and  Oracle  cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity. The Information  previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions. On May 26, xAI said it closed a  $6 billion financing round  led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly  introduced  the startup. Conflicts of interest While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a  post on X  in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post. Tesla’s latest  proxy filing  indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has  ordered  that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal. If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI. Musk’s comments in the January post rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.” Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent. “When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.” Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain. “That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said. Musk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies. For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk  enlisted  dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once. At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup. A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s  2016 acquisition of SolarCity , where he w"

According to a document  filed  with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Tesla said in March that it began to look into reports from drivers in China about what it called ""unintended hood opening events.""  Subsequent company investigations revealed the presence of deformed hood latch switches, an issue that it said ""could prevent the customer from being notified of an open hood state."" Further studies led the company to issue a voluntary recall of affected vehicles ""out of an abundance of caution."" No injuries or deaths have been reported as a result of the issue, Tesla said, and only 1% of vehicles are likely to suffer from the defect. But, it acknowledged that “unknowingly driving a vehicle with an unlatched hood may result in the hood fully opening and obstructing the driver’s view, increasing the risk of a collision."" The recalled vehicles include:  Tesla Model 3 vehicles produced since 2017 and equipped with a hood latch manufactured in China. All Tesla Model S vehicles manufactured since 2013. All Model X vehicles manufactured since 2016. All Model Y vehicles manufactured since 2020. To remedy the issue, Tesla has released an over-the-air software update, as it customarily does in instances of recalls.  The recall is Tesla's ninth of the year, and the fourth since 2022 to affect more than 1 million vehicles. The company remains under federal investigation in the wake of a  NHTSA report  that found Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 of which resulted in fatalities and “many others” yielding serious injuries."

Tesla’s Latest Earnings Report Leaves Investors Reeling - The Global Treasurer,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPdG5PRFpvRnpwSUdwOWdhUnRnRHVEWFd3VUFnX04xT3RxM3JYWXlvbU4zZm9GTlBaMXl0NC02REJsakdZWXJWanU2VldZNEttSkRJV0xKVmpqWEpUdXJuZVZ1XzFmNDZYR1ZfOVZjUGlpMU12OTBDcWFBNmdGWFNuU1RDUGkyVzhxOEU1OC1zTVd6RnVfOWVSS2hydG9sbVNLYnFj?oc=5,"Thu, 25 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla recently reported its fourth consecutive earnings miss, causing significant concern among investors.   The electric vehicle giant’s adjusted earnings per share fell short of Wall Street expectations, coming in at $0.52 compared to the anticipated $0.61.   What caused the decline and what does it mean for the market?       Factors Contributing to the Earnings Miss   Several key factors contributed to Tesla’s recent earnings miss. Firstly, the company’s adjusted operating margin shrank to its lowest in three years, dropping to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier.   This decline marks the fourth consecutive quarter of margin shrinkage. Tesla has been aggressively cutting prices and offering incentives to boost sales, which has significantly impacted its profitability.   For instance, the company introduced zero-interest loans in China and Germany and a 0.99% APR financing deal in the U.S.   Additionally, Tesla’s operating expenses soared by 39% due to substantial investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure, including the development of its Dojo supercomputer and AI processors.   These investments aim at advancing Tesla’s autonomous driving and robotics capabilities but have added considerable financial strain.   Furthermore, automotive revenue fell by 7% from the previous year, exacerbated by increased competition, particularly in China, and a decline in deliveries of Tesla’s most popular electric vehicles.   Impact on Tesla’s Stock and Market Reaction   The earnings miss had an immediate and significant impact on Tesla’s stock. Shares tumbled nearly 8% in extended trading, falling to $227.23.   This decline reflects investor concerns over the company’s shrinking profit margins and increased expenditures. Despite a 2% increase in annual revenue, the market’s reaction was largely negative due to the 7% drop in automotive revenue and the substantial decline in net income.   Tesla’s stock had been relatively stable for the year, down less than 1% before the earnings report, while the Nasdaq had risen by 20% over the same period.   The disappointing earnings have led to a cautious outlook among investors, with some analysts recommending selling Tesla shares. The company’s aggressive price cuts and increased spending on AI projects have raised questions about its ability to maintain profitability in a highly competitive market.   This market reaction underscores the challenges Tesla faces in balancing growth and profitability.   Future Outlook and Investor Sentiment   Looking ahead, Tesla’s future outlook is a mix of cautious optimism and significant uncertainty.   The company has ambitious plans to revolutionize the automotive industry with its advancements in autonomous driving and robotics.   CEO Elon Musk has reiterated that Tesla’s long-term value lies in its autonomy capabilities, suggesting that those who doubt this vision should reconsider holding Tesla stock.   The upcoming robotaxi unveiling event, now scheduled for October, is highly anticipated and could be a pivotal moment for the company.   However, the path forward is fraught with challenges. Tesla’s heavy investments in AI infrastructure and the development of new technologies like the Dojo supercomputer are costly and have yet to yield immediate financial returns.   Additionally, the company’s decision to delay the production of more affordable vehicle models until 2025 raises questions about its ability to capture a broader market segment in the near term.   Investor sentiment is currently mixed. While some remain bullish on Tesla’s long-term prospects, others are concerned about the short-term financial pressures and competitive landscape.   Analysts have pointed out that until Tesla can produce new, lower-cost models, pricing and incentives will continue to weigh on margins. This cautious outlook is reflected in the recent stock performance, which has seen significant volatility following the earnings miss.           Subscribe to get your daily business insights"
Tesla’s Profit Sees a 5-Year Low But Carbon Credit Sales Hit Record High - CarbonCredits.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOdzBRSExHc01GVzBvNTlORFhqZUR6TEdRUS1YWmdMOW1ORGxGeFE0Mk93YUxyMUt2WWxJdjI0Z2tvSGtNLU83dVN1WEpZRVBfOEd1amlycGpnRDBCNGdQdjFmWVNiQmZQX1RVNFg4aWQxUGg4WnAzcVFZLXFKZjVYQm1wWWxub3VsMjM1cm04VTNIWHExQzVDUXJtYzYxY0RhVmpjeHB4U3g0Qkh2VW1n?oc=5,"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla reported its lowest profit margin in over five years and missed Wall Street earnings targets in Q2, as the company cut prices to boost demand while increasing spending on AI projects. However, Tesla’s carbon credit (regulatory credits) revenue is at an all-time high, hitting $890 million.    Tesla Profit Struggles Amid Carbon Credit Sales Surge     Tesla  reported a 45% drop in profit for Q2, earning $1.5 billion on $25.5 billion in revenue, compared to $2.7 billion on $24.9 billion in the same period last year. Thus, the operating profit margin fell to 6.3% from 9.6%.   This decline in profit increases pressure on CEO Elon Musk to find new growth avenues. Despite this,  Tesla shares  have surged 40% since May, driven by investor optimism that Musk will transform Tesla into an AI company offering driverless taxis and robots.   Tesla’s Q2 electric car sales fell 4.8% to 444,000 vehicles, with production down 14% to about 411,000 cars. This setback follows a 55% drop in profit and a 9% revenue decline in Q1 2024.   Tesla faces increasing competition as other manufacturers ramp up electric vehicle production. For the first time, Tesla’s share of U.S. electric vehicle sales fell below 50% in Q2, according to Cox Automotive.   Amid all these lackluster results, the EV giant has seen a record-high  sale of carbon credits  at  $890 million , the highest since the company started selling these regulatory credits in 2017. This revenue stream is up 216% from $282 million a year earlier and a 102% increase from Q1 ($442m).      Competition Hits Tesla Hard: Carbon Credits to the Rescue   Most notably, the $890 million carbon credit revenue is almost  60%  of Tesla’s Q2 net income of $1,494 million. Thus, carbon credit sales bolstered the company’s bottom line.   This additional revenue stream is essentially pure profit, as companies can bank credits exceeding their immediate needs. For an EV-only company like Tesla, which has no combustion business to offset, the constant flow of these credits has been a financial “gusher,” comparable to a highly profitable oil strike in the fossil fuel industry.   Tesla continues to  profit from selling carbon credits  to competitors who need to comply with emissions standards. This business model is highly lucrative for Tesla, as earning these credits incurs minimal costs, translating to pure profit. This revenue stream has been crucial for Tesla’s financial success.   The EV maker aims to produce new, more affordable EVs by early 2025, though cost reductions will be less than expected. The company laid off over 10% of its workforce to reduce costs, and profits were impacted by restructuring charges and higher operating expenses driven by AI projects. Automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, was 14.6%, below the estimated 16.29%.          As a result of a series of price cuts, profit per vehicle plummeted.   Chart from Reuters   Elon Musk acknowledged that the influx of more affordable electric cars from other manufacturers “has made it more difficult for Tesla” to sell vehicles. From April through June, Tesla’s share of U.S. electric vehicle sales dropped to 49.7%, down from 59.3% a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.   Ford Motor sold nearly 24,000 EVs in Q2, a 61% increase from a year ago, while General Motors’ sales of battery-powered models rose 40% to nearly 22,000 vehicles. Investment analyst Dan Coatsworth noted that Tesla has missed earnings targets for four consecutive quarters.    Another Growing Business For Tesla   CEO Elon Musk highlighted that new competitors have significantly discounted their EVs, challenging Tesla. The company’s  EV deliveries  have declined for two quarters, facing rising competition and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models. Sales of China-made EVs, which are also exported, fell in Q2 compared to strong growth from Chinese automakers like BYD Co.   Despite these challenges, Tesla expects a production increase in Q3. Amid declining profits, the company has seen significant growth in its rapidly growing energy storage business.    In Q1 2024, energy storage deployments reached a record 4.1 GWh, with revenue and gross profit from the Energy Generation and Storage segment hitting all-time highs.   In Q2 2024, Tesla Energy deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products, including Megapacks, Powerwalls, and solar products. This marks a 132% increase from Q1 2024 and a 157% year-over-year rise.    The growing number of Megapack installations and an expanding fleet are expected to drive consistent profit growth in this segment.  Battery system sales, primarily for electricity grids, doubled to $3 billion in Q2.   Tesla’s Q2 financials reflect a significant drop in profit and production amid intensified competition and rising operating costs. However, record-high carbon credit sales provided a crucial boost to the bottom line, demonstrating the importance of this revenue stream. As Tesla navigates these challenges, its investments in AI and energy storage hint at new growth avenues beyond electric vehicles."

Tesla Signs A Landmark Multi-Billion Dollar 15 GWh Megapack Deal - CarbonCredits.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxORHEtNmpaNk9ydjEydHBucTRZMVRxclBfQmdHUFZoQllXdFZWOGFfLS1rWVFrR0RGdG1DbmRweFlSdjY2RWFEbmo4UHRpZXVpdEpFcWN5WEVoUDJ0UDZjWW84QTVoQnliMVIxOEhXWU1KMGcxcnI0SXRub252OEl0cFVHR3FvVEVUVWlIUFRKT3dGZmhvdFlWTQ?oc=5,"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","While Tesla’s energy storage segment is smaller than its automotive business, it has been experiencing significant growth. This segment has rapidly accelerated and expanded after maintaining consistent growth over the years, with recent massive Megapack contracts secured.    Tesla  and Intersect Power have signed a contract for 15.3 GWh of Megapacks, Tesla’s advanced battery storage system, for the latter’s  solar and storage projects  through 2030. This deal, along with previous agreements, positions Intersect Power as one of the top global buyers and operators of Megapacks. It has nearly 10 GWh of large-scale storage expected by the end of 2027.   Though the contract’s cost wasn’t disclosed, the massive energy involved says it’s a multi-billion dollar deal, depending on pricing.    Tesla’s Megapack is a large-scale lithium-based  battery energy storage system  aimed at improving grid stability and preventing outages. Each unit has a storage capacity of over 3 MWh, sufficient to power 3,600 homes for 1 hour.   Tesla’s Battery Energy Storage Crazy Growth   Despite a  decline in automotive revenues , Tesla has seen growth in other business segments, particularly in energy storage, which is becoming increasingly profitable. With the rising number of Megapack installations and an expanding fleet, Tesla expects consistent profit growth in this segment.   In Q1 2024, Tesla’s energy storage deployments hit a record high of 4.1 GWh. Revenue and gross profit from the Energy Generation and Storage segment also reached all-time highs.   In Q2 2024, Tesla Energy deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products, including Megapacks, Powerwalls, and solar products. That’s more than double the Q1 2024 deployment (132% increase) and up 157% year-over-year.     Tesla has previously supplied 2.4 GWh of Megapacks for Intersect Power’s solar and storage facilities, which are either operational or under construction.    The new agreement will see more than half of the Megapacks used for 4 major battery installations in California and Texas.  They will begin operations by the end of 2027, including some of the biggest battery installations in the U.S. The remainder will be allocated to future solar and storage projects coming online between 2028 and 2030.   Mike Snyder, Senior Director of Tesla Energy, stated,    “Intersect continues to be an exceptional partner, and their development expertise combined with the plug-and-play nature of Tesla’s vertically integrated technology enables the speed and scale needed to enhance grid resilience and support greater renewables integration.”   Amplifying Intersect Power’s Leadership in Clean Energy Storage   Intersect Power is a clean energy company focused on innovative, scalable low-carbon solutions. Established in 2016, the company develops, owns, and operates some of the world’s largest clean energy resources, delivering low-carbon electricity, fuels, and related products for both domestic and international markets.         Intersect Power is committed to advancing grid-tied renewables and large-scale clean energy assets, including battery storage,  data centers , and green fuels. It has a portfolio of 2.2 GW of operating solar PV and 2.4 GWh of storage.   The energy company is known for its large and adaptable Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) at its solar and storage facilities in Texas and California. The Megapacks are set for delivery in 2025 and 2026 and will be produced at Tesla’s Megafactory in Lathrop, California.   Currently, Intersect Power has 2.4 GWh of Tesla Megapacks either operational or under construction. These include the 1 GWh at the Oberon solar and storage facility and 448 MWh at the Athos III solar and storage facility in California. An additional 1 GWh of Megapacks is being installed at the Radian and Lumina solar and storage facilities in Texas. Their full operational status are expected within the year.   According to the  U.S. Energy Information Administration , battery storage capacity in the country has been on the rise since 2021. It is projected to increase by 89% by the end of 2024, provided that developers bring all planned energy storage systems online as scheduled.   Current plans indicate that U.S. battery capacity could exceed 30 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2024, surpassing the capacities of petroleum liquids, geothermal, wood and wood waste, and landfill gas.           Developers anticipate bringing over 300 utility-scale battery storage projects online in the United States by 2025. And about 50% of these planned capacity installations are in Texas.           Tesla Energy’s Power Gain Major Boost with Megapacks   Tesla Energy has also signed a $375 million contract to provide Megapacks for a major battery project in Australia. The agreement will support the construction of a 415 MW/1660 MWh battery, one of the world’s largest four-hour duration batteries.   The Megapacks will be used for Akaysha Energy’s Orana Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), located in New South Wales within the Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).   Tesla Megapacks have been making notable strides in Australia’s energy market. In October 2023, a 150 MW/300 MWh Tesla Megapack system was commissioned in New South Wales.    Earlier this year, a 250 MW/500 MWh project broke ground in Queensland. Additionally, in April 2024, Tesla Energy was awarded a contract by Neoen to expand the Collie Battery, aiming to transform it into the largest battery in Australia, with a final capacity of 560 MW/2,240 MWh.   This Megapack agreement, alongside Tesla and Intersect Power’s significant deal underscore the growing demand for advanced energy storage solutions. These partnerships are set to enhance grid stability and support the transition to a low-carbon economy worldwide."

A look into the Tesla Cybertruck through the lens of Tallahassee owners - Tallahassee Democrat,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNbHE1MHpQS3gteHBBbzhZV2NRVmQtazlPTkJJZV84dmFZNkRxTkRKYV96WGIxbEl4S0I0OEdPZS1FTHo5MkU0RDNtV0VjOHNPakNaMEtTaDlsWDJGMGhDNFVhbXpIV1cwWmxwV09XYzg1dl83OWp5MnRsMHhaSnNyZmJKWVBIWHRSVnU5bGQwMFVTTVhtenJYLU5sTk9HMUVSMVQzbVB6OWJwcHdBVHcxWkd1Wmdjek9URmMxWTBISFBZenF5NWFDdTk4Xy1JN3Ewb0JKNw?oc=5,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","The Tesla Cybertruck is the new spaceship-looking automobile taking the streets, and social media, by storm. In February, Tallahassee became home to two Cybertrucks. After connecting with each other in Cybertruck USA, a Facebook group, owners John Fabrega and Carl Fuqua rode to Jacksonville together to take possession of their new vehicles. “He posted on there that he was getting his, and I posted on there that I was getting mine,” Fabrega said. “Lots of people were, because it’s been years. If you got your invitation to order, then you got your (vehicle identification number), and then you got your invitation to pick it up. We were kind of back and forth, because we both got those things at the same time.” The two-hour adventure to Jacksonville to finally get their new trucks was met with excitement and anticipation. Quickly, the pair, both Tallahassee business owners and self-proclaimed tech-geeks, became good friends. The two sleek, stainless steel pick-up trucks were parked right next to each other at the delivery center. On the way back to the capital, they became the first and second in Tallahassee. Both Fabrega and Fuqua, owners of Line1 Communications and Fuqua Insurance Agency respectively, acknowledge the truck's unconventional appearance. Fuqua had a firsthand glimpse of the prototype at the Tesla shareholders conference in Austin, Texas, last year, and thought the truck was unbelievable in person, which change his initial thoughts when the vehicle was revealed in 2019. At the time, the allure of being a trailblazer in automotive innovation superseded the truck's physical appearance. “Being a Tesla owner for nearly 10 years, you have to be an early adopter,” Fuqua said from his office. “It’s like you’re driving a beta in the early days. Not so much anymore, because they’ve become mainstream. But definitely for the early adopters, you had to be a real tech geek and not mind being almost a beta tester.” His commitment to the brand led him to unique experiences, like escorting Motown legend Smokey Robinson in a Tesla Model S to a Ruby Diamond Concert Hall concert in 2017, fulfilling a clause in the artist's concert rider contract. Fabrega echoes similar sentiments, emphasizing the appeal to its features and functionality over form. “Back in 2019 when they announced it, I said, 'man, that thing is ugly,' but I still put my reservation down,” Fabrega said. “It was because of the technology, and because I like things that are a little off the wall. It was ugly, but interesting.” Both men own the Cybertruck Foundation Series model, which costs $102,235 new. Fuqua purchased his under his insurance agency, since it is used for business travel. Because of that arrangement, the vehicle qualifies for tax deductions based on  the IRS tax code . A look inside Some may believe Tesla has done away with the gas, since the U.S. based company produces solely electric vehicles. But the unique flatulence sound made through its Toybox feature says otherwise. Quirky elements like this, along with its innovative technology, the spacious five-seat interior, and hidden gems like the 'frunk,' and power outlets and an ice cooler in the trunk bed are what attracts its owners. On a recent morning, Fuqua took a Tallahassee Democrat writer and photographer on a test-drive in his Cybertruck, which is wrapped matte-black to stand out among the traditionally stainless steel look. On this trip, he provided insight to the appeal many owners find with its cutting-edge features and technology. In a quick spin around the block to a local grocery store near Fuqua's headquarters, the sports car feature was most impressive. While the Cybertruck weighs 6,700 pounds, it picks up speed exceptionally fast. According to Tesla, the truck has great durability. The company says its ultra-hard stainless-steel exoskeleton is bullet proof, preventing dents and damage, and the glass windows are both shatter resistant and tinted so no one can look inside. While taking a pitstop in a grocery store parking lot, onlookers stopped to take pictures and tell Fuqua how 'awesome' his truck is. He says that to be a Cybertruck owner you have to be social, at least for the next few years until the initial ""wow""factor dies down. He says that while online it seems like the Cybertruck has a lot of critics, the response in-person almost never reflects that. Oftentimes, people simply question what it is. Fuqua emphasizes that the design, while unconventional, sets the Cybertruck apart. Unlike its competitors, it was crafted as an electric truck with an intentionally futuristic appearance. CEO Elon Musk created this vision, inspired by a question one of his children asked, ""Dad, why doesn't the future look like the future?"" “You said this to the richest, most innovative man-child on the planet,"" Fuqua said. ""And what did he do? He made the Cybertruck."" While it may not resemble traditional pick-up trucks, the functionality remains. With its 11,000-pound towing capacity and 6' x 4' trunk bed dimensions, Tesla claims the Cybertruck is big enough to haul construction materials. The Cybertruck is nimble and floats on the road, despite its large frame. This can be traced back to the embedded steer-by-wire and four-wheel steering Fabrega says is his favorite feature. ""It is so unique and it kind of changes the driving experience,"" Fabrega says. ""Though ironically, I don't notice it as much, when I'm driving it (the Cybertruck). But then, when I drive a car that doesn't have that, it feels really weird."" Fuqua describes the featured squircle steering wheel as comparative to a video game controller, in the sense that the wheel isn't directly connected to the tires and it doesn't rotate an entire 360 degrees, like a traditional wheel would. The amount force used on the wheel determines how wide or sharp a turn will be, instead of the tires turning with the wheel. The steering wheel can actually double as a game control with some of the games available on the navigation screen in the Toybox center. Even though it doesn't take hours to charge a Cybertruck, nobody wants to be bored at one of the many Tesla Supercharger stations. Tesla owners can sit in their vehicles and engage with the fully functional theater, arcade and Toybox, where they can activate 'Musk's must' with the fart sound it exudes. Next for Tesla in Tallahassee Now, in Tallahassee there are six Supercharger stations. More recently, a sign for the new Tesla Service Center on West Tennessee Street went up, marking the establishment of the brand's presence in the capital city.

Please let us know if you have  feedback .                Dive Brief:     Tesla was affected by the massive IT outage sparked by CrowdStrike’s software update last week, CEO Elon Musk confirmed Friday in a series of posts on the social platform X.   In response to an X post by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Musk said the outage “ gave a seizure to the automotive supply chain .”   Musk said CrowdStrike has been  deleted from all of the company’s systems . Tesla has not responded to a request for more information about how its operations were impacted by the outage, but Business Insider reported that the automaker  shut down two of its production lines  early Friday morning. The automaker has not disclosed if the lines are back up and running.      Dive Insight:   Windows computer systems crashed worldwide Friday following CrowdStrike’s defective software update. The issue, which affected the company’s Falcon cybersecurity platform, caused massive disruptions of critical functions across multiple industries,  Cybersecurity Dive reported .   But compared to last month’s CDK Global cyberattack that affected sales, the impact of the CrowdStrike outage appears to be minor for the automotive industry, said Arun Kumar, partner and managing director in the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.   “I’m sure that some suppliers were impacted by [the IT outage],” Kumar said, but noted it pales in comparison to COVID-era disruptions and even the CDK cyberattack. Additionally, he noted the firm’s clients have not yet reported any major disruptions.   Rockwell Automation’s 2024 State of Smart Manufacturing Report found that  cybersecurity is the biggest concern for automotive industry leaders  worldwide. Yet with the growing market for connected cars and software-defined vehicles, top executives aren’t concerned enough, Kumar argues, referencing how many chief security officers still report to chief information officers, rather than to CEOs.    “I think that level of visibility and rigor has not gone all the way up to the top,” he said. “We believe that we still have a long way to go in making sure that we’re truly protected.”    Kumar said the broader question should be around what quality-control mechanisms are in place to avoid such situations in the future, both internally and externally. Meanwhile, many U.S. OEMs are sprinting to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation, which can lead to security lapses in an effort to gain a competitive edge.   It’s about finding balance between robust internal controls for security and keeping up with the competition, Kumar said.   “It’s the biggest challenge for a lot of the automakers, and suppliers, too.”"
Tesla Energy deploys company record 9.4 GWh of storage in Q2 2024 - Utility Dive,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPYUp2WjY2aDdRR1FOZ0xHTlgyWkJkVzZIdDNyekJaVWFLV1ZMTjFreWROMzJrZFRUY2V3cG9QVGdnckxPdEZLYV9LNWtDRk85ci1PQmQzeGRLc2RnUmhnR0lNczdFcXRzUGtNU2NFcE1ZSkdWYUdnWnI4M2JQTTYtWG5xOU1NQnM3bEJXd2hucXg0WEJyUXpsckp6SlZvOEpKdy1WUEJWR2o?oc=5,"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Listen to the article          4 min                          This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have  feedback .                Dive Brief:     Tesla’s energy generation and storage division deployed 9.4  GWh  of energy storage products in Q2 2024, more than doubling its previous record, set in the prior quarter,  the company said July 2 .   Tesla Energy deployed 4.1  GWh  of energy storage in Q1 2024, bringing its total storage deliveries to 13.5  GWh  in the first half of 2024. The company delivered 14.7  GWh  of storage in all of 2023, according to its financial reports.   “Our non-automotive business is becoming an increasingly profitable part of Tesla,” the company said in its  Q1 2024 earnings report . “As  Megapack  continues to ramp and as our fleet continues to grow, we are expecting consistent profit growth of our non-automotive business.”     Dive Insight:   The United States added nearly 26 GWh of energy storage in 2023, according to a  report  released by Wood Mackenzie earlier this year. Though  90% of total U.S. storage deployments  were utility-scale and 77% of those bulk installations occurred in California and Texas, the 2023 figures represent a 90% increase over 2022, Wood Mackenzie said.   Tesla Energy’s storage deployments jumped 157% year-over-year and 132% quarter-over-quarter.   The Q2 2024 figures suggest Tesla Energy’s Lathrop, California, Megapack factory is nearing full production capacity,  Tesla commentator Sawyer Merritt  tweeted July 2. The Lathrop facility has a 40-GWh annual production capacity.   “We have our second [assembly] line allowing us to increase our exit rate from 20 GWh per year … at the start of this year to 40 GWh per year by the end of the year,” Tesla Senior Director of Megapack Mike Snyder said during the company’s Q1 update.   Larger Tesla Megapack customers typically order batteries 12 to 24 months in advance of delivery, allowing Tesla to plan production several quarters in advance, Snyder said.   Tesla expects to begin production in Q1 2025 at a second 40-GWh Megapack factory it’s building in Shanghai, China, Tesla Senior Vice President of Automotive Tom Zhu  told Teslarati  in May. The Shanghai factory will be the company’s first dedicated energy storage facility outside the United States, Teslarati reported.   Megapack is designed for utilities and large commercial users, with each unit capable of storing 3.9 MWh,  Tesla says .   Tesla will release detailed second-quarter financial results on July 23, the company said July 2.   In Q1 2024, Tesla Energy booked a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 140% year-over-year jump in gross profit thanks to higher Megapack deployments, “partially offset by a decrease in solar deployments,” the company said in its Q1 update.   Tesla expects its energy storage deployment and revenue growth rates to outpace those of its automotive business in 2024, the company said last quarter.   “Our non-automotive business is becoming an increasingly profitable part of Tesla,” Tesla said. “As Megapack continues to ramp and as our fleet continues to grow, we are expecting consistent profit growth of our non-automotive business.”   Still, energy storage and generation is a small part of Tesla’s overall business. The division booked revenues of $1.64 billion in Q1 2024, compared with automotive revenues of $17.38 billion."

Tesla Model Y Secures Position as World’s Best-Selling Car in 2023 - Body Shop Business,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPVC16YVJiX0RkWUxBVmlKRHpIQW82aFZ6c2d1bzZOeFdoNFdGVU1ZV0hOenN3NXdybGhKdGxUV1FlbzYwbV9fNlZhd0lLUEZzdGVablhUTzlSU3NLWmVwSmFhMVAyY3BWNkp6Z1RUdmRwRkc1OUl1SDIyODZaUTVVS1V1T0NvVU84NVBaeXN0T0xsRElRa2IxU0x2MUNnMTJf?oc=5,"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Despite facing many challenges, the global automotive industry performed well in 2023, according to JATO Dynamics. JATO data and estimations showed that for 151 markets across the world, a total of 78.32 million new passenger cars were sold last year. This marks an increase of almost seven million units from 2022 — a 10% increase.       “The growth seen in 2023 is remarkable, especially considering the ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and the USA; the instability generated by conflicts across Europe; the high interest rates that persisted in most of the Western world; and the high price of vehicles,” said Felipe Munoz, senior analyst at JATO Dynamics.   However, last year’s positive results were not driven by China. While the annual volume for this region increased by 6% when compared to 2022, both the USA-Canada and Japan-Korea saw an increase of 12%. In fact, Europe was the fastest-growing market in 2023 as a result of booming demand in Turkey, the region’s fourth-largest market, ahead of Spain. In addition to this, the strong push from the local authorities to incentivize demand for electric vehicles (EVs) also contributed to accelerated sales, JATO data found.   Every region, except Africa, saw demand for new cars increase. According to JATO Dynamics data, sales volume in this region decreased by 6% to 956,000 units. JATO said this result can be explained by a significant decline in Egypt, which was the continent’s second-largest market in 2022 and the third last year. South Africa accounted for 51% of the continent’s total, while North Africa represented 34%.   Over One in Five Cars Sold in Emerging Economies   While the industry generally focuses its attention on the European, U.S. and Chinese automotive markets, 22% of new car sales in 2023 came from emerging economies.    “Over 17.5 million new cars were sold in the emerging economies in 2023,” Munoz said. “That is more than the total sales in U.S. or Europe during the year.”   India led this group by a significant margin — as the fourth-largest individual market in 2023, it sold 4.19 million passenger cars, JATO said. Brazil and Iran followed with 2.12 million units and an estimated 1.43 million units, respectively. Approximately 1.30 million units were sold in Mexico, while Turkey accounted for 984,000 units.   The market share of Chinese car brands grew across regions such as the Middle East, Eurasia and Africa, while posting growth in Latin America and Southeast Asia. These cars also gained a share in developed economies, including Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. In contrast, the U.S. and India saw little uptake of Chinese cars, similar to Korea and Japan.   In 2023, Chinese brands outpaced their American rivals for the first time. Chinese-origin brands sold 13.43 million new cars in 2023, up by 23%, while their American brands sold 11.93 million units, up by 9% from 2022. Japanese brands maintained a strong position in the global market with a total of 23.59 million units.   “As the domestic market shows signs of deceleration, Chinese manufacturers are searching for sources of growth abroad,” said Munoz. “Ambitions to develop a presence in the U.S. and Europe have been disrupted by robust policy measures designed to protect legacy manufacturers. Chinese brands have already been successful across emerging economies due to easier access policies, lower trade barriers and higher price sensitivities among consumers. The EU decision to impose tariffs of up to 38% on imported Chinese EVs from as soon as July this year offers fresh rationale for a continuation of this strategy.”   SUVs Gain Further Traction   With 36.72 million units sold last year, not only did SUVs post a new sales record but also recorded their highest-ever market share, according to JATO data. Between 2022 and 2023, SUV volumes increased by 16%, accounting for closer to 47% of the total global passenger car sales last year.   Growth was largely due to the success of Tesla in the SUV segment (+62%), alongside increased demand in Europe, India, the Middle East and Eurasia, JATO said. China and U.S.-Canada remained the largest markets for SUVs, accounting for 54% of the global total.   Among the top 10 largest car makers in 2023, Hyundai-Kia was most dependent on sales of SUVs, with these vehicles accounting for 56% of its passenger car sales, followed by Ford (49%) and Volkswagen Group (48%).   Tesla Model Y Becomes World’s Best-Selling Vehicle   As anticipated in JATO’s preliminary 2023 results, released in February, the Tesla Model Y made history last year. The midsize SUV secured the top position in the global ranking as the first-ever pure EV to lead the global market.   JATO data found that the Model Y secured this position without a presence in most emerging markets, where it continues to be unaffordable for the majority of consumers.   Sales of the Tesla Model Y totaled 1.22 million units globally, up by 64% from 2022, or 480,000 more units than 2021 — a result achieved by no other manufacturer before. Consequently, the Model Y managed to outsell traditional global top-sellers like Toyota’s RAV4 and Corolla sedan.   In previous years, these models have featured at the top of the ranking due to healthy demand in North America, China, the Middle East, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and many markets across Latin America, Africa and Central Asia.   The RAV4 sold 1.07 million units (+5%), while the Corolla sedan placed fourth with 803,000 units (-19%). Weakening sales of the compact sedan can be attributed to its age — the vehicle was first released in March 2018 — along with the arrival of the Corolla Cross, its SUV counterpart, which quickly gained popularity in developing economies. The Honda CR-V occupied the third position following an 18% increase in sales.   Toyota placed another two models in the top 10, while the Tesla Model 3 secured the 10th position. Other big players included the Ford F-150 and the Nissan Sentra.   The most popular Chinese model was BYD’s compact sedan, the Qin. This was placed in the world’s top 25 alongside two other BYD models. Among the top 25 were 13 Japanese models, five American, three Chinese, and two Korean and European models."

""I'm just going to give you a figure,"" Thierig said at the Tesla factory, which employs some 12,000 people in a sprawling complex southeast of  Berlin . ""We've bought 65,000 coffee mugs since we started production here. 65.000! Statistically speaking, each of you already has five Ikea coffee cups at home.   ""I'm really tired of approving orders to buy more coffee cups,"" he said to laughter and applause, promising there would be no cutlery in break rooms if the thefts didn't stop.   Environmental and safety concerns   Even before the tens of thousands of purloined cups, and the most recent workers' council elections, Tesla's Gigafactory in the Grünheide, in the state of  Brandenburg , has been a center of controversy.   Almost immediately after Germany beat out bids by at least eight other EU countries to host Tesla's first European factory in 2019, criticism began to mount about the environmental toll  of constructing the factory . This included clearing hundreds of hectares of forest and concerns of groundwater contamination.   Soon after the beginning of production in 2022, German magazine  Stern  published an expose alleging serious violations of worker safety and health regulations as well as environmental laws. The report found that the Tesla plant had registered three times as many emergencies as a similar Audi plant in the city of Ingolstadt.   In 2024, the factory was the site of  environmental protests  against a planned expansion of the plant, which was finally given the go-ahead  after a protracted political battle over the plans . Battling Tesla's Gigafactory To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that  supports HTML5 video   Layoffs spark factory in-fighting   More recently, a push from Tesla CEO  Elon Musk  for factories worldwide to reduce their workforces by 10% have resulted in layoffs of many temporary and part-time employees, and called into question how much the factory is going to boost Germany's economy in the long run as was promised.   Although the Grünheide plant only reduced staff by about 2%, Works' Council member Uwe Fischer told  Handelsblatt  that there was ""obvious pressure"" on employees to take what was billed as an ""attractive"" voluntary redundancy offer.   According to IG Metall union secretary Jannes Bojert, Tesla workers are facing extreme pressure, bullying and frustration over the number of safety accidents at the plant.   This was countered at the staff meeting by Michaela Schmitz, the recently reelected leader of the Worker's Council, who believes the union is exerting undue influence on its members to agitate within the workforce.    ""Nobody is controlling anyone,"" the union responded. Bojert, in turn, accused Musk, management and other employees of stirring up anti-union sentiment that he described as ""unconstitutional.""   He described a strike as a ""last resort"", but not out of the question given the current climate at the factory.

Tesla recalls 1.85 million vehicles over hood latch issue that could increase risk of crash - USA Today,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOclNVYmRrZUxTWVRLbFl2dE8wM2FLTUk3X3VQOUUwdjEyR3dQR1dhUHhQQTJ5SmZlM29Zc1Q0S0dlaGN5Z05PR2tHOHo5SmI2MlZhSmxLYVNmOFZ6d3pkOWI1Nmk0WWYtLWNrMUJVeTVTZUtQZTRVdFl0Q1gtai1EVnZyYUszZXl3OElBTFdBN1BtYWY3WVZvYjFxTUY?oc=5,"Tue, 30 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla is recalling nearly 1.85 million vehicles in the U.S. due to concerns over a hood issue that could cause the vehicle's driver to crash. The recall pertains to certain 2021-2024 Model 3, Model S, Model X, and 2020-2024 Model Y vehicles, according to the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA). The recall was issued because the affected vehicles' ""hood latch assembly may fail to detect an unlatched hood condition after the hood has been opened,"" the NHTSA said. The federal government agency added that if the Tesla's hood is fully open, it could obstruct the driver's view and increase the risk of an accident. Tesla has released a free over-the-air software update that will detect an open hood and alert drivers, the NHSTA said. Owner notification letters should be mailed out on Sept. 22. Owners can contact Tesla customer service or the NHTSA Vehicle Safety Hotline. Tesla's number for this recall is SB-24-00-012. Tesla has been investigating hood latch issue since March The Tesla models a part of the recall were equipped with a hood latch produced in China by Magna Closures Co Ltd. Tesla has been investigating customer complaints of unprompted hood openings in certain Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China since March. The company then began a latch hardware recovery and in-service vehicle inspection. Tesla confirmed three reports of the hood issue in the U.S., but no reports of crashes or injuries have been connected to the recall. Largest Tesla recall since December 2023 This is the  largest recall of Tesla vehicles since December  when the automaker recalled 2.03 million U.S. vehicles to install new safeguards in its Autopilot system. Despite Tesla installing the safety features, 20 crashes were reported involving vehicles that had the new Autopilot update, prompting the NHTSA to open a probe that found ""several concerns"" concerning the recall. Last month, Tesla voluntarily recalled  thousands of its popular Cybertruck models  due to windshield wiper malfunction and a trunk bed trim issue. Contributing: Reuters"

"Despite Tesla Slide, EV Sales in Q2 Mark New Record - Cox Automotive Inc.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE1UUG5PXzM3djUxVHg2bzNmaWxGNm9nZ0MzWDR5dFpzU0Z4VXNuem9FbGRoYzNGT3lFSThERU5GaV9UOEdKRUpENWk5N3dHUzRXcVZlSkdPNVZCWHFWc3pISlY1OVEyaGhxRTdyLQ?oc=5,"Thu, 11 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. grew by 11.3% year over year in the second quarter, reaching a record-high volume of 330,463 1  units, according to new estimates from Kelley Blue Book. This growth was driven partly by improved availability, higher discounts and elevated levels of leasing. Total EV sales last quarter were higher than Q1 sales by 23% percent. In Q2, market leader Tesla sales volume declined by 6.3% year over year, but new products, notably from General Motors, helped lift overall volume higher. In the second quarter, Tesla’s share of EV sales fell below 50% for the first time in the U.S. to 49.7%.   The sales estimates from Kelley Blue Book show that electric vehicles accounted for approximately 8% of total new-vehicle sales in the second quarter, higher than the 7.1% share in the first quarter of the year and higher than the 7.2% recorded in Q2 last year.   Cox Automotive Industry Insights Director  Stephanie Valdez Streaty  commented: “EV sales exceeded expectations during a record-breaking quarter. Despite Tesla’s declining sales, with its EV sales share now below 50% for the first time, the overall competitive landscape for electric vehicles is intensifying. This increased competition is leading to continued price pressure, gradually boosting EV adoption. Automakers that deliver the right product at the right price and offer an excellent consumer experience will lead the way in EV adoption.”   TESLA SHARE OF TOTAL EV SALES       While Tesla remains the dominant player in the EV segment, new electric offerings by mainstream competitors – and more aggressive pricing – continue to provide shoppers with interesting alternatives. Notable new entries in Q2 include the BMW i5, Cadillac Lyriq, Honda Prologue, and Kia EV9 SUV. Higher volumes of the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning helped the Ford brand retain its No. 2 position, behind Tesla, in the EV market.     New EVs from General Motors are also helping grow industry volume. In Q2, GM added more than 21,000 EVs to the market. New models include electric versions of the Chevy Blazer, Equinox and Silverado, which tallied more than 10,000 sales in Q2, although the extra volume was not enough to offset the discontinued Chevy Bolt. In Q2, Chevrolet’s EV sales were lower by 19% year over year.  Other major players who lost ground year over year in Q2 include Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Porsche, Volvo and VW.   Q2 2024 EV SHARE OF TOTAL BRAND SALES       Added Valdez Streaty, “We remain bullish on electric vehicle sales in the long term. The growth will, at times, be very slow, as all-time horizons in the automobile business are vast, but the long-term trajectory suggests that higher volumes of EVs will continue over time. As EV infrastructure and technology improve, and more models are launched, many shoppers sitting on the fence will eventually choose an EV.”     1 Kelley Blue Book counts exclude super exotics."
Tesla's energy business is growing — and it could be company's next big earnings driver - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNYmJNeXFuYW5VX2FiTVZaYzRFMUFRR0c0QlJGeTlMaEoxYUg2OWlzRFBSZWhJaUp1NUdwN0V6Tnc3X0ZYT2xsdmZMbjVXLTg2b2gxOUdTM2ZTYmZOd0RZanA2V3VRZGR4eDB2bWl6c1VlMHNCT0lieFpTZnVSampTQ183dTQ5SUF6YmkydGItMUZPS0lyWDQ1V29CaHJHV3JhLTdwaUJuckl3VnFoU3lYUXVHZ1NWME40NzdfZ3hJQmlyR3RYLW9iM2lB?oc=5,"Wed, 10 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","When it comes to valuing and analyzing Tesla ( TSLA ) stock, Wall Street analysts — at least the bullish ones — say the company is more than an automaker. And one area of outsized growth for Tesla beyond its car business could be energy.   In its  second quarter production and delivery report , Tesla said that it deployed 9.4 GWh (gigawatt hours) of battery energy storage, its highest quarterly amount ever, and more than double the amount of battery storage the company deployed in the first quarter.     Fuel for growth? A Tesla Megapack energy storage unit. (Tesla.com)   ·   Tesla   Tesla’s energy storage business, part of  Tesla Energy , includes installations as small as  Powerwall batteries  for the home to massive  Megapack storage facilities  meant for utilities and municipalities to store large amounts of energy for deployment at peak energy usage times.   While a Powerwall typically holds around 12.2 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, or enough to power a small home for a day, one Megapack installation can hold 3.9 megawatt-hours of energy, enough to power 3,600 homes for one hour, Tesla said.   Though Tesla only booked $1.6 billion in revenue from its energy storage business in the first quarter, the company reported a healthy $403 million in gross profit from the business, good for a gross margin of 24.6%.   Tesla’s overall gross profit was $3.7 billion in Q1, with a gross margin of 17.4%, which was down from 19.3% a year ago. The drop in gross margin was due to Tesla’s EV price cuts, which were meant to spur demand and have been eating into profits over the past year.   Here's why energy could be another catalyst for Tesla stock.       Tesla’s auto business, which represents the lion’s share of the company’s revenue and profits, is now actually weighing on Tesla’s overall gross margin, notwithstanding the positive effects of the growing profits and operational efficiency of its energy storage business.   But with Tesla doubling storage deployments in Q2 versus Q1, the effect on the company's bottom line could be substantial — and Wall Street is of course noticing the growth, and profit appeal, of Tesla’s energy storage business.   Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas dubbed Tesla’s Q2 energy deployment storage figure a “show stealer,” noting the 9.4 GWh deployed was double the firm’s forecast.   “We believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the US electric grid accelerated by the AI boom,” Jonas wrote in a note to clients last week.   Morgan Stanley has a $310 price target on Tesla.   Jonas believes generative AI spending and resulting buildouts will spur a “multigenerational increase in energy demand,” electricity generation, and data center investment, and Tesla’s energy storage business is poised to benefit."

The interesting news is that the company will release a more affordable vehicle in the first half of next year. The bad news, if you think of Tesla as a car company, is that CEO Elon Musk is sticking to his line that it isn’t.   It was also another weird, low-energy call from Musk, though I find he’s a bit more honest when he’s in these down moods. Elsewhere in the Tesla-verse is a judge’s ruling in the company’s favor that it can pursue a trial against Rivian for allegedly encouraging its ex-Tesla employees to steal trade secrets.     The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   Alphabet, aka Google’s parents, aren’t so bothered by GM’s robotaxi shift and are doubling down with a $5 billion investment in its robotaxi arm Waymo. Does it sense blood in the water?   We work hard around here. It’s our culture. But we don’t, I hope, have the stereotypical “Japanese salaryman” kinda vibe. Toyota, also, is hoping to move away from those vibes as it takes a deliberate pause to fix the company.   Tesla Margins Drop To 14.6%   VIDEO   If you want to lose money, bet against Elon Musk. He has been right more than he’s been wrong, and his companies have made a lot of money for investors. He’s also destroyed shorts with the same intensity of an imperfectly potty-trained toddler after a frito pie bender.   I guess I should clarify: If you bet against Musk in the last year, depending on the timing of those bets, you might have made some money.   My question yesterday about Tesla was more about revenue than margins. Specifically, I was curious how much the company’s push to move cars at a discount would hit Tesla’s historically high margins.   If you look at the  company’s Q2 financial disclosure  you’ll see the answer is: a lot. Tesla’s margins, after you take out regulatory credits the company gets from other OEMs, dropped to 14.6%, versus  analyst estimates of 16.29% . The company did make about $1 billion more in revenue than expected, it just made less money than usual doing it.   If The Autopian were making billions of dollars (it is not) I think I’d be fine with making a little less per dollar if I was making it up in volume. Tesla doesn’t work that way, and its margins were a big part of its perceived value. That’s at least how investors seem to be feeling today. Tesla’s stock is down almost 12% this morning.   Even though the company made a little more in total revenue (up about 2%),  where  it made those revenues is important:         I’m turning a bit into a broken record here, but Elon Musk  does not think of Tesla as a car company . One of the few times he didn’t sound listless during the hour+ call was when he talked about buying chips and AI and his Optimus robot.   Here’s what Elon had to say about all of that:   The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright. I really just can’t emphasize the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus. Although the numbers sound crazy, I think, Tesla is producing at volume with and supervised MSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate a giant autonomous fleet. And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.   That’s not a lot about cars, though Musk did basically confirm that the affordable Tesla is coming in the first half of 2025 and, rather than some mostly gigacast car, it’ll be a more traditional Tesla model that can be built on existing production lines:   We won’t get too much into the product road map here because that is reserved for product announcement events. But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.   I would suggest listening to this section (which  you can do here ) and you’ll notice he barely finishes his thought about the car before jumping into:   The big — really, by far, the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy. In addition to that, we have scale economies and, I think, we’re the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.   If autonomy is so important to Tesla how long do we have to wait to see a fully self-driving robotaxi? Musk was immediately asked this question and gave a more-than-usually accurate assessment:   “It’s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that — to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.”   Musk has made it clear that he’s not content with having a car company, and he doesn’t believe a car company is a particularly interesting or valuable thing to own. He owns an autonomy/robotics/taxi/airbnb/energy storage company. If you think he can pull even half of that off then you don’t really care about a short-term share drop because the impending value of the company makes it a future Apple.   If you don’t believe in him then you should run.     Tesla Can Go Ahead With Rivian Lawsuit     Did Rivian encourage Tesla defectors to steal Tesla’s company secrets in order to improve Rivian’s products? That’s the question at the heart of a lawsuit from Tesla against its rival EV automaker.   Rivian, for its part, denies this happened, and tried to get a judge in California to dismiss the case outright.  According to  Reuters , that’s not going to happen:   Judge Theodore C. Zayner of the Santa Clara County Superior Court tentatively denied Rivian’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, stating Tesla presented sufficient evidence for a trial.   “Tesla’s evidence establishes that some Rivian employees were less thoroughly investigated and not disciplined,” the judge wrote in the tentative order.   This will be one to watch.   Google/Alphabet Puts $5 Billion Into Waymo     Maybe autonomy  is  important. Google’s parent company Alphabet announced it’s putting $5 billion into its subsidiary Waymo just as  Cruise said it was discontinuing development of its steering wheel-less robotaxi .   From  CNBC :   “This new round of funding will enable Waymo to continue to build the world’s leading autonomous driving company,” Alphabet’s outgoing finance chief Ruth Porat said Tuesday on the company’s second-quarter earnings call, adding Waymo is an “important example” of Alphabet’s long-standing investments.   Porat announced the “multiyear” investment on the call and said more information would be available in the company’s quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing, expected on Wednesday.   The next steps for Waymo are replacing the Jag i-Pace-based robotaxis with Zeekr-based Waymo Drivers and a more robust commercialization.   Toyota Pushes For A 4-Day Workweek     The stereotype of a Japanese “salaryman” is an overworked white-collar employee who puts in 60 hours for his beloved employer, only taking a few hours off to get absolutely blitzed while singing John Denver songs in some seedy karaoke bar.   In a way, that’s how the whole Toyota company has worked for the last few years. Toyota ended up  making more money than any other public Japanese company  in history last fiscal year, but at what cost? Toyota’s employees were  so stretched they started cheating on emissions and safety tests  they would have probably otherwise passed. Suppliers are taxed. Investors are wary.   Hans Greimel over at  Automotive News  has a story  about how Toyota is joining a larger corporate shift in Japan to reconsider what an employee-employer relationship should look like as the company tries to slow down.   Executives likened the pause to “pulling the andon,” the Japanese term for the cord factory workers pull to stop the assembly line when they spot a problem and need to troubleshoot.   “Existing workloads should be reduced for the time being,” Sato said in May. “We should question whether a particular work is necessary or not. We might need to stop certain types.”   Will Toyota actually go for a four-day workweek? Maybe not. The overall goal is to achieve a work/life balance, whatever that means.   What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD   VIDEO   This is not my joke, but someone today reminded me that the real song of the summer has been/will always be Len’s “Steal My Sunshine.” And, look, I don’t want to get too political, but there’s been a real vibe shift this week and I think we can all appreciate a little Len right now.   The Big Question   Do you like a four-day workweek? What do you do now?"

The  earnings report  fell short of Wall Street expectations for profit. “There have been quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market and mostly, they have not done well, but they have discounted their EVs quite substantially, which has made it more a bit difficult for Tesla,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk told analysts on Wednesday. Tesla shares  plummeted  more than 25% at the outset of 2024 but the company had recovered all of those losses this month after it released a better-than-expected report on vehicle deliveries. The stock price decline on Wednesday puts shares at their lowest level in more than three weeks. The earnings results released on Tuesday mark two consecutive quarters of declining profits. Revenue from government credits increased to $890 million in the most recent quarter, accounting for more than half of the company’s profits. Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, said the boost in revenue from government credits afforded the company a financial lifeline even as it struggled in its main line of business: selling vehicles. “What is the core business doing?” Johnson told ABC News, suggesting the decline in performance was even worse than the earnings indicate. Critics say demand for the company’s vehicles has slowed as a result of its failure to release a new, affordable model, as well as a softening in the overall EV market. As competitors roll out alternatives, Tesla faces a difficult path to regain its previous breakneck growth, analysts previously told ABC News. Proponents, however, point to the company’s record of industry-leading innovation, suggesting the breakthroughs that fueled its sprint ahead of the competition could reemerge as it readies for new EV models and perfects its autonomous driving software. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on Mar. 22, 2022, near Gruenheide, Germany. Christian Marquardt/Pool via Getty Images Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, who is bullish on Tesla, downplayed the weaker-than-expected earnings report and highlighted potential gains from the company’s development of autonomous vehicles. “We were not looking for major fireworks this quarter from Tesla,” Ives said on Wednesday in a note to investors. “The next phase of the Tesla growth story is around autonomous, Robotaxis, and AI playing out for Musk & Co. in our view and that vision is on the doorstep.” Speaking to analysts on Tuesday, Musk said the company had made “a lot of progress” on its full self-driving software over the most recent quarter. “We think customers will experience a step-change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works,” Musk added. That product has faced challenges, however. In December, Tesla  recalled  about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system. Two months later, the company  recalled  about 360,000 more cars over crash risks tied to its self-driving system. Musk said on Tuesday that the company is delaying the launch of its Robotaxi service until October. Johnson, of GLJ Research, voiced skepticism about the Robotaxi initiative. “Tesla doesn’t have one Robotaxi on the road,” Johnson said."
Will Tesla's Cybertruck define its future? - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNRmMyNDBqb2ZZYU5KYWFrYzM2YldHV3BkbG9CSVNpOVJwV05VU3hHWG1GejNudXBvWmJHU1NkbldESjNmMVF4eTZTdGFQcUlPOHNhQTBxLTZ0cnVPQW9FV0NYd2ZwcXFDRUlpVzc3YXhzdmM0bVZmZmN6Y3JWTmZsVk5JZVFCc3doRXZCcTVGUQ?oc=5,"Sat, 20 Jul 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla’s ( TSLA ) Cybertruck is divisive.   The electric truck received nearly 2 million  preorders  before its 2019 release, but the hype has cooled off in some corners of the market. That’s partly due to its higher-than-expected price tag,  recalls leading to safety concerns , and its design.   “It’s got a really ugly look. Ugly is interesting.”   That’s how Shark Tank investor and entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary described the car to Yahoo Finance in May 2023. O'Leary has invested in companies providing the technology behind the truck.   As of mid-June, Tesla was producing  1,300 Cybertrucks  per week, with a goal of reaching  2,500 weekly vehicles  by the end of 2024. With a price tag reaching almost $100,000 for the top-of-the-line model — the  Cyberbeast  — the truck is more expensive than the roughly $50,000 price investors were anticipating.   Will the Cybertruck become Tesla's next big hit, as pervasive as the Model 3, or will it be a miss for the EV company? Here are a few things to consider when evaluating the potential impact of the Cybertruck on Tesla’s financial future.     In this Nov. 21, 2019 file photo, Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, Calif. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu, File)   ·   ASSOCIATED PRESS   Bulletproof. Stainless steel skin. A steering wheel that feels electric. These are all features that are unique to the Cybertruck, the first vehicle in the US to use a full steer-by-wire system.   Steer-by-wire differs from typical pickup trucks in that it uses electronics to steer rather than having a steering rack that connects the wheel with the tires. It's considered to be a more energy-efficient system.   While the bulletproof exoskeleton of the car is a draw for some consumers, for others, it’s a  nonstarter .   “The Cybertruck is way out there … harkening to this sort of Blade Runner-esque, dystopian sort of looking, kind of hard edges stainless steel,” according to  Pras Subramanian , Yahoo Finance’s senior automotive reporter.   The car's aesthetic could be here to stay. Walter Isaacson, who  wrote a biography of Musk , has seen preliminary sketches of the much-anticipated (and  delayed ) robotaxi and said it  looks like the Cybertruck .   In terms of demand, the Cybertruck could be a key differentiator in an increasingly competitive EV market.       Tesla’s share of US EV sales  fell below 50%  for the first time ever in the second quarter. At the same time, the Cybertruck was the highest-selling EV pickup truck in the US in the month of May, according to  S&P Global .   While Tesla hasn’t revealed how much it costs to build the Cybertruck, the vehicle was first built at the company’s new Texas Gigafactory, which Musk said was a $10 billion investment.   And the process of building the truck is not easy. The unique exoskeleton is formed using a technique called air bending, which uses high air pressure to shape the stainless steel.     Tesla’s goal is to get the price tag near $50,000, but these manufacturing costs could make that difficult to achieve.

Despite mixed reviews, loyal Tesla fans may continue to support Musk’s product visions — and Tesla's stock price. Tesla’s short sellers have  lost over $60 billion  since the company went public, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners. Ultimately, company fundamentals, such as sales numbers for the Cybertruck, are not always what drives Tesla's stock performance. “Really, it’s what the market is doing rather than exactly what Tesla is doing,” Dusaniwsky said.

The crash happened April 19 when the Tesla driver, a 56-year-old man from Snohomish County, was driving on autopilot behind the motorcycle on eastbound State Route 522 east of Maltby, the state patrol said. The driver told authorities that he was looking down, distracted by his phone, when “the next thing he knew, there was a bang,” and the Tesla hit the motorcycle, said a statement of probable cause said,  NBC affiliate KING  of Seattle reported. Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood was ejected from the motorcycle and died at the scene, authorities said. Chris Loftis, a spokesperson for the state patrol, told NBC News on Wednesday that the Criminal Investigative Division confirmed the vehicle was in ""Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) mode"" at the time of the collision. The conclusion was reached after information was downloaded from the car's event-data recorder, State Patrol Capt. Deion Glover told  The Associated Press.  Loftis said it's illegal to drive in self-driving mode without ""active control and attention of the driver. Bottom line — if you are behind the wheel, you are responsible and must be in full awareness."" The car — a 2022 Tesla Model S — was not impaired at the time of the collision, according to the state patrol. The driver, who was not named, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide based on his admission that he was distracted while he was using the autopilot feature. However, the driver was not officially charged. He posted bond before his initial hearing, and the case was referred to the prosecutor for an out-of-custody charging decision, authorities said. The investigation continues, and the Snohomish County prosecutor will ultimately determine whether any charges will be filed. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

5th Circuit rules for Tesla in its fight to sell electric vehicles directly in Louisiana - Louisiana Illuminator,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1BT2IwUkNTWWwtXzRIcEJwbFNJWkozTVRjTDBfWTJvQ0tsYzFZRG13Qi01RmllbEo1LWZGSGdHYV9uTklUN1FnSVdVdTRwdHdOXzhna0QtT3BwQXdTdUt0N2tscw?oc=5,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","A federal appellate panel has jump-started what had been a stalled lawsuit from electric automaker Tesla against Louisiana auto dealers and the state commission that regulates them.    A change the Legislature made to state law in 2017 has prevented Tesla from selling or leasing its vehicles directly to buyers in Louisiana, forcing customers to go out of state if they want to purchase one. In August 2022, the company sued the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission and the Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association, whose members hold a majority of the seats on the commission.   The case was dismissed last year in the U.S. District Court for Eastern Louisiana. But in a 2-1 decision issued Monday, judges from the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeal sent the case back to the lower court. Its decision found that the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission, with the deck stacked in favor of dealers, is biased against Tesla.   In its original court complaint, Tesla’s attorneys cited email correspondence between members of the auto dealers association and the Motor Vehicle Commission that revealed they have collaborated to keep the EV brand from conducting direct sales in Louisiana.   “… (T)he bias is predictable. The Commission will always be incentivized to exclude new business models from entering the market,” 5th Circuit Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote in his opinion.   Smith, a federal court appointee of President Ronald Reagan, ruled in the majority with Judge Catherina Hayes, who President George W. Bush selected for the court. Judge Dana Douglas, a selection of President Joe Biden, dissented.   “We disagree with the opinion and expect further appeals to follow,” Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a text message through her spokesman. Her agency represents the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission.   Claude Reynaud Jr., attorney for the auto dealers association, declined to comment on the 5th Circuit ruling or a possible appeal.    Mark Beebe, a New Orleans-based attorney representing Tesla, also declined to comment, citing the company’s policy for not discussing ongoing litigation.

"NY prepared to charge Tesla rent, slash job penalties in new deal - Investigative Post",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPNGs4cDdjY2hSelBWaEFGR1B2SjBkSE5RZ3ZoMmFWYllod0I3V3ZKMlBJeEI3el9OSlZFS1FLNEJNZW4xMVJWV0pKVXFJalVFTEp3RzRKTlZIYnQxTG5SSXF0VkpiYlhtejU0eWRLR0JHUVNjeko1aU5nYjRmaHEtVlVVSlhfR3hxamZRSjZOOVk?oc=5,"Wed, 14 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla took over the lease for the South Buffalo factory in 2017 and currently pays $1 per year in rent. A new 10-year lease includes some major perks for the electric vehicle manufacturer.         VIDEO     New York State officials are prepared to slash penalties on Tesla in coming years, even if the company fails to hire enough workers at its South Buffalo plant and across the state.   Under the company’s current arrangement with the state, Tesla must employ 1,460 workers in Buffalo and 2,000 statewide or else pay a $41 million fine. That deal, however, expires this year.   According to details of a draft agreement, which could run through 2034, Tesla must employ 1,800 in Buffalo and 3,000 statewide. The current penalty will stay in place through 2029 but will drop to $10 million after that.   Before CEO Elon Musk announced company-wide layoffs in April, state officials were prepared to cut the fines sooner and more steeply. Tesla and state officials agreed to fines no higher than $3,333 for every job Tesla fell short on hiring, according to a letter of intent signed in January that outlined terms of the new deal. Had the company missed its goal by 1,000 jobs, for example, it would have only owed a $3.3 million fine.   Officials have since reinserted existing penalties of $41 million for the first half of the new agreement with the company, with reductions not occurring until 2030.   Other terms of the new deal — details of which Empire State Development released in response to a Freedom of Information Law request — include:     Tesla will locate its “Dojo Supercomputer” at the Buffalo factory, a $500 million project Gov. Kathy Hochul announced in January.   Tesla will pay rent — $2 million annually through 2029 and $5 million annually through 2034.   Tesla will hire 500 more employees if state lawmakers allow it to open 10 direct-to-consumer car dealerships across the state.     The agreement, which is not believed to have been signed, would also see both Tesla and Empire State Development invest more in job training programs in Buffalo.     Letter of intent, correspondence between New York and Tesla. Records obtained via FOIL.     Despite Tesla’s increased investments and job commitments, critics of the state’s original deal with Tesla said the new lease doesn’t go far enough to hold the company accountable to taxpayers who paid for the $959 million factory the electric vehicle manufacturer occupies.   “It makes a bad deal better,” said state Sen. Sean Ryan, chair of the Senate’s economic development committee, who noted neither the original agreement nor the draft agreement required higher wages for Tesla employees.   Empire State Development declined to make officials available for interviews for this story. An agency spokesperson also provided limited information in response to questions from Investigative Post. It’s not clear, for example, if a final agreement has been signed yet.    In response to questions about whether or not Tesla had agreed to have higher fines reinserted into the deal and if the agreement had been finalized, Empire State Development spokesperson Matthew Gorton suggested Investigative Post contact Tesla.   A Tesla representative did not respond to a request for comment. The company  disbanded its public information team  in 2020.   Details of draft deal   Tesla’s current lease with New York — which it took over from SolarCity and the solar panel parts maker Silevo — went into effect in September 2014 and was slated to last for a decade. That means it expires next month.   Tesla and Empire State Development signed a letter of intent outlining terms of a new lease and broader agreement Jan. 18. A week later, Hochul announced that Tesla would spend $500 million and locate its supercomputer in Buffalo.   Investigative Post filed a request under the Freedom of Information Law for details of that agreement shortly afterwards. For six months, Empire State Development failed to turn over records, despite state law giving agencies about a month to process requests. Investigative Post then appealed the agency’s delay and received 12 pages of documents in late July. Empire State Development released the January letter of intent and several pages of correspondence.   The correspondence showed that Tesla’s April layoffs alarmed Empire State Development and caused the agency to reopen negotiations with the electric vehicle manufacturer. Empire State Development President and CEO Hope Knight penned a letter to Tesla May 13 demanding to know how many workers the company was laying off and what its plans were for the Buffalo factory. Tesla responded two weeks later assuring Empire State Development that it was committed to New York and meeting its job goals.   The agency was unmoved. Knight responded in a July 25 letter that said, because of the layoffs, “ESD will not move forward with the project revisions outlined in the [letter of intent].” She said additional negotiations were needed.   Prior to the layoffs, Tesla employed 1,804 in South Buffalo and 2,707 statewide. It cut 345 positions in Buffalo and 450 in total. Under the terms of the new agreement, it must employ 1,800 in Buffalo and 3,000 statewide. Empire State Development, records show, worried that Tesla wouldn’t be able to meet the terms of the agreement.   While some details of the deal have changed since the layoffs, other terms are still in place.    Tesla, for example, is still on the hook to invest a total of $5 billion in New York, not including its $500 million supercomputer project. The company must also now pay rent to occupy the publicly-owned factory on South Park Avenue: $2 million annually through 2029 and $5 million annually after.   In the event Tesla doesn’t invest $500 million in its supercomputer — discussed as part of larger regional effort to make advancements in the artificial intelligence sector — Empire State Development will double its rent until it meets that level of spending.   Tesla’s rent payments, however, will largely go towards maintenance and improvements at the factory, benefitting the company.    “It is intended that the base rental payments will provide a source of revenue to ensure the continued maintenance and repair of the Gigafactory New York manufacturing facility,” the letter of intent outlining the agreement states.           Subscribe to our free weekly newsletters         New York will further use $250,000 of the rent for job training programs through 2029 and $1 million of the rent for the programs through 2034. Tesla will separately pay $250,000 annually to job training programs.   Under the agreement, existing pots of money for facility improvements will remain. Investigative Post revealed in November the existence of a $29 million pot of money  that Tesla has already tapped  for factory projects.   It further stipulates that New York will ensure Tesla can win all regulatory approvals for its supercomputer.   “Tesla’s commitment to locate supercomputing capabilities at the Gigafactory New York manufacturing facility is premised upon ESD ensuring rapid and efficient permitting and a State commitment not to unreasonably withhold or delay all approvals, consents, permits, modifications or waivers,” the letter of intent reads.   The agreement also includes language that Tesla will hire 250 more workers in New York should lawmakers grant approval for the company to open up five direct-to-consumer dealerships, and another 250 jobs for an additional five dealerships.   The car dealership question   Tesla’s ask to open up more car dealerships is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the draft agreement. For one, it would take an act of the state legislature.    Prior to 2014, Tesla opened a total of  five showrooms  in New York despite a state law that restricts direct-to-consumer sales by auto manufacturers. Auto dealer associations sued the company but lost in court. In 2014, under a threat by the state legislature to ban Tesla from direct-to-consumer sales, the Cuomo administration brokered a deal allowing the company to keep its five existing dealerships open.   When Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016, its consultants contemplated whether it should move into the Buffalo factory at all — or simply pay a fee to New York and walk away. The company chose to move into the existing factory, records show, in part because Tesla wanted to curry favor with state leaders so it could expand in the future.   “Any action by SolarCity related to this project that is viewed negatively by the local policymakers could negatively impact policies for the combined entity,” the consultant report concluded.   If Tesla wants to open more locations, state law would have to change. For now, it’s moving forward with a plan to open a  sixth dealership  on Oneida land near Syracuse.   Ryan suggested lawmakers would not have an appetite to approve more dealerships for the company.   Auto dealer associations are also opposed.    “They should become a franchisee if they want to expand and play under the same set of rules that every other franchise dealer and independent dealer in New York State is currently exposed to,” said Paul Stasiak, president of the Niagara Frontier Auto Dealers Association.   He added: “I think Tesla should focus on keeping their employment where it should be and not worry about adding more locations. They’re getting a very generous tax break to be here, very generous, that most companies don’t achieve and now they want to take advantage of that further.”   Ken Girardin, research director at the Empire Center think tank, also questioned Empire State Development agreeing in principle to allow more Tesla sales locations. He, too, noted that there would be “lots of variables” at play to get the state legislature to approve more locations for Tesla. He said more comprehensive reform was needed, rather than catering to one company.   “They are dangling a carrot there,” he said. “It shouldn’t be a questi"

"Tesla issues recall for 9,100 Model X cars, but this one is a bit more serious - Mashable",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTFA0UWRIbEJDelMtSkFHdmlsY2t5dzBBOHBhNE1zQlFVbmtySlBTZkxET1FINU9SckZqX0FlSnBnS3VvU196akdMYjAwenVqSWJlY0xoWURJRUw0Z1lsZ0E?oc=5,"Thu, 22 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla issuing a recall for just over 9,000 cars is hardly a surprise these days, given that the company has recalled millions of cars over the years, including a recall for  1.8 million cars  just weeks ago.  However, while most of Tesla recalls are for issues that can be fixed with software updates, this new one is notable as it requires a visit to the service center.  According to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report (via  Reuters ), Tesla has issued a recall for 9,136 Model X SUVs over a trim on the roof that could separate and increase the risk of a crash.    ""The Model X is equipped with a cosmetic applique at the front of the roof just behind the windshield, known as the front applique, as well as an applique at the center of the roof in between the upper falcon door roof glass, known as the spine applique. Both appliques are adhered to the vehicle using urethane. If the applique-to-urethane interface lacks primer, then, over time, the adhesion may weaken, causing the applique to separate from the vehicle,"" the report said. Owners of affected Teslas, which are all of the 2016 model year Model X vehicles, will have to go to a Tesla service center where the roof trim adhesion will be tested and trim pieces reattached to make sure the cars are safe to drive, at no cost to the owners.    Also notable is that this is the  second time  these Model X vehicles have been recalled for the same issue. The first time it happened was in 2020, but now Tesla says that fix was not sufficient to truly remedy the issue.    According to the company, there have been about 170 reports and claims due to this issue. Tesla said it wasn't aware of any crashes or injuries related to the issue."
Menlo Park Police Department’s Tesla patrol vehicle pilot finds that Teslas don’t appear to be ‘patrol cars of the future’ - The Almanac,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-AFBVV95cUxQUWVCZ3ljVEU4S0phZFdNTVg2SlZKZ3FXM2FQLWx5LWhLZUYyZlM2WmtDTkdGX2dlU1Q2LVFSeTQ2Q1JKWjhGSXNZUGxFVjFyVnNHdmx5OWtGdTRTYklqSlhHYi14M2kwWXVucnhhRnZiV3RwS1VRXzY3SG9CTThhcW9PNjVBQ0duNWU3alJCN3oxOHVmZTZvSGg0Mkh5TWlDSzlIaWtNV0FBTGZ0RVlNcTBVa3RRaUVaeXdxbTV3d01jdVZjNHBtbXFIZTUtQi15SEZqYXQyaThZbEw5LUVEVWRpMDNrTVJHYUlXUUs1a1FCMDZ6Z3JjTg?oc=5,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Menlo Park’s three Model Y Tesla patrol vehicles. Courtesy city of Menlo Park.  On Tuesday, Aug. 27, the Menlo Park City Council received  an update  on the Menlo Park Police Department’s Tesla pilot program, which aims to see whether Teslas, or other electric vehicles, could be used as patrol vehicles.  Over the course of the program, police staff found that while “Teslas are useful within the department for patrol and non-patrol operations, (they) do not appear to be the ‘patrol cars of the future,’” due to officer safety concerns, lack of off-roading ability and limited space for gear, personnel and detainees.  In 2021 , the City Council  voted 3-2 to implement the Tesla patrol car pilot program  as part of the city’s effort to be carbon neutral by 2030. As part of the city’s Climate Action Plan, Menlo Park has vowed to eliminate fossil fuel use in all city operations by 2030.  Because Tesla does not manufacture any purpose-built police vehicles, the police department had to outfit and modify the vehicles to be used as patrol vehicles. Modifications included the addition of lights, sirens, plastic seats and specialized seatbelts in the rear of the car, communications equipment, a gun rack, window guards and ballistic door panels. According to  a city staff report  on the pilot, at the time that the program was initiated, there were no zero-emission patrol vehicles available direct from a manufacturer.  While purpose-built police vehicles can be upfitted by the manufacturer to include upgrades such as the ballistic door panels, the Teslas had to be sent to an additional outfitter located in southern California, which proved to be more expensive, according to the staff report.  The base price of the Tesla Model Y was $64,270 and upgrades and outfitting cost the city $38,482 per car, which made for a total cost of $102,752 per car. The hybrid Ford Explorers that police otherwise use cost $51,620 for the base price of the car and $21,224 for upgrades and outfitting, for a total cost of $72,844 per car.  Despite concerns over vehicle driving range due to the added weight of the outfitting and ballistic panels, the pilot found that the vehicles had sufficient range at 80% charge to complete all shifts.  Officer safety concerns One of Menlo Park’s Tesla Model Y patrol vehicles. Courtesy city of Menlo Park.  According to the staff report, a majority of the challenges that police staff faced were due to the outfitting of the Tesla, and the “smart” features of the car.  Officers reported that their weapon access was restricted by the center console height, that the car’s lights would time out at night, that the cars locked themselves without a key inside and that autopilot would occasionally interfere with the types of driving necessary during the course of police patrol.  Officers relayed in the staff report that “on occasion, the Teslas automatically stop when an officer attempts to pull off to the side of the road to approach vehicles or people.”  Officers also said that they experienced issues with lighting controls, as Tesla does not allow direct access to the lighting system, and they were required to go through a “multi-step touchscreen process” just to dim their lights. According to the staff report, it was also difficult for officers to keep car lights on during traffic stops when they stepped away from their cars.  The smart locking functions of the cars also posed a challenge to officers, as the car would automatically lock when the key was out of range, and automatically lock when the key was in range.  City staff looked into modifying some aspects of these smart features to make the vehicles more appropriate for patrol use, but “the outfitter relayed that they attempted to reach out to Tesla but were not able to access or modify the central operating system,” according to the staff report.  Police department staff provided a list of recommendations that Tesla could address to support patrol use of Tesla vehicles, including a “public safety mode” that disables some autopilot steering corrections, a customizable sleep mode that would keep car lights on and unlimited digital keys for police accounts.  Staff also found that future outfitting of Teslas for police patrol should include a checklist to ensure that voice commands are turned off and that the rear doors do not open from the interior, as well as wider seats and lower consoles to accommodate officers wearing patrol gear.  “I am very proud that we tried the Teslas, and not everything works,” said Council member Betsy Nash. “I appreciate all the work that the police department did with working through all the bumps.” Despite the space constraints and challenges with outfitting, officers reported that they did appreciate the acceleration, steering and vehicle speed compared to the hybrids and gasoline-only patrol vehicles.  Climate action plan 2022 data shows that Menlo Park’s police patrol vehicles account for a significant portion of the city’s emissions. Courtesy city of Menlo Park. The Tesla pilot program was implemented as part of the city’s climate action plan, which aims for the city to be carbon neutral by 2030. When Menlo Park last completed a greenhouse gas inventory for city operations in 2019, emissions from the city’s car fleet contributed nearly half of the city’s overall carbon emissions. Among city departments, the police department generates the most vehicle miles traveled, and within the police department, patrol vehicles specifically generate the most vehicle miles traveled. According to  fleet mileage data  gathered from February 2022 to February 2023, police department patrol vehicles accounted for 58% of emissions and 38% of vehicle miles traveled. This made patrol vehicles an easy target for lowering the city’s carbon emissions.  According to the staff report, the Menlo Park Police Department will continue to use the Tesla vehicles that they have already purchased. Staff will also continue to monitor the market for all-electric patrol vehicles as they emerge.  In 2023, the City Council approved the purchase of a Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle that is rated for police pursuit, and staff are hoping to deploy the Blazer as the next stage of the pilot by early 2025."

Mixed results for Tesla and BMW in European EV market - Autovista24,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOa2tlM3dTdzV2S04wbjNaZEZMNDRBampET2FEQ1NOb0YwRDhTV2dNS24wc3FyM040UU1wNTZncHVBcnFJd1pPWkRaeXo0MG1KaDBSUDcyUXRoS1JqSDFRMzBkbjlJVHhLLXF4bk44a1BCZWRsWGphUmUtNk9JUWZld2gxT081d1lJeXZqUWJwa0I4Ynk4ZkU5RkVqMWRXQ0k?oc=5,"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Mixed results for Tesla and BMW in European EV market   19 August 2024     Tesla led Europe’s electric vehicle (EV) market during June, as other local brands faltered. José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, looks into the data with Autovista24 journalist Tom Hooker.   Tesla emerged as  Europe’s  best-selling  EV  brand in the first half of the year. It accounted for 11.4% of battery-electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV)  registrations  between January and June. This was up from its 10.5% share recorded in May, as it benefitted from the carmaker’s traditional quarterly delivery schedule.   However, compared to the same period last year, Tesla has lost ground. It fell 1.7 percentage points (pp) from its 13.1% share during the first half of 2023.   In second place, BMW captured 9.9% of Europe’s plug-in market. This was a 0.4pp decline from its result posted in May. Yet, the  manufacturer  achieved growth compared to the first six months of 2023, when it accounted for 7.9% of EV deliveries.   Mercedes-Benz took third with an 8.8% market share. Like BMW, the marque lost ground, down 0.2pp from its position in the first five months of 2024. Despite this, its share increased from 12 months ago, up 1.4pp on the first half of 2023.   Volvo followed the same trend in fourth, dropping 0.2pp to an 8.6% share in the first half of the year. However, this was a significant improvement from the 6.5% recorded at the same point last year.   Many brands could be affected by the EU’s  provisional tariffs  which are aimed at BEVs built in China. Confirmed in July, these duties are added to the existing 10% rates applied to models coming into the EU. However, these tariffs do not apply in non-EU member states.   Audi slips   Rounding out the top five was Volkswagen (VW) which made up 6.5% of registrations, up 0.3pp from May. Yet, this was a stark contrast to its 8.5% share from one year ago. The carmaker finished in the European EV top three in eight of the last nine years. So, it can be expected to try and accelerate sales until the end of 2024.   The carmaker is focusing on the future of its EV fleet, although there are challenges ahead.  Handelsblatt  recently reported that the brand may delay the launch of its Trinty EV to 2032 instead of 2026.   Instead, a fully-electric Golf May be launched in 2029 or sooner. This would make it the first VW model to use the OEM’s new scalable systems platform, also known as the SSP. In the meantime, the modular electric drive matrix, or MEB, is due to be upgraded to the MEB+ in 2026.   VW overtook Audi, which fell 0.2pp to a 6.5% market hold in June. This drop was largely due to the poor performance of its Q8 e-Tron. The manufacturer sat 1.2pp ahead of its share in the first six months of 2023.   Kia and Peugeot sat outside of the top six. Both brands accounted for 4.5% of EV deliveries during the first half of the year. For the former, this was a decline from its 4.7% market share in May. Meanwhile, Peugeot’s share fell 0.3pp from the previous month, and 0.2pp compared to the same period last year.   VW Group’s comfortable lead   Grouping carmakers under their parent  companies , VW Group maintained its comfortable lead in June. It captured 20.2% of Europe’s plug-in market, a 0.1pp improvement from its May result. The OEM has grown from its 19.9% share recorded in the first six months of 2023.   Tesla came in second, reaching an 11.4% market share. The brand jumped three positions in June, despite losing 1.7pp compared to its performance from the first half of last year.   Third place went to Stellantis, which continued to struggle. The group dropped to an 11.2% share from 11.7% in May. This contrasts starkly from its 14.3% share recorded at the same point last year.   Stellantis will be hoping to profit from its new and more affordable EV models. The OEM may also be helped by the introduction of artificial intelligence into new group models. The Alfa Romeo Junior and Citroen C4 look set to benefit from  SoundHound Chat AI  with integrated ChatGPT.   Reuters  reported that Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares was ready to axe underperforming brands after poor first-half results this year. Meanwhile, the company still expects to launch 20 new models this year.   BMW in fourth   BMW Group finished the month in fourth, making up 10.7% of registrations. This was a drop of 0.2pp on May, yet 1.2pp above its performance recorded in the first six months of last year. Geely-Volvo took fifth with a 10.6% market share. Despite falling 0.1pp from May, the OEM jumped 1.9pp compared to the same period in 2023.   Outside of the top five, Mercedes-Benz Group secured sixth, capturing 9.1% of Europe’s EV market. This was a 0.4pp decline from May, but an increase from its 8.3% share recorded in the first half of last year.   Elsewhere, Hyundai Motor Group accounted for 7.8% of plug-in deliveries. This was down 0.3pp on May’s result and marked a 0.4pp decline on its performance from the first six months of 2023.   The OEM may benefit from its development of an extended-range EV powertrain in the future, as reported by  The Korea Economic Daily . Meanwhile, according to  Korean Car Blog , a European hatchback version of the South Korean-built Kia EV4 is being developed and may be produced in Slovakia.   Finally, Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance took a 5.1% share, up from its 5% market hold in May."

Nevada’s Manufacturing Boom: From Tesla to a New Industrial Frontier - Urban Land Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNX3BnWFlZbEZXSmJlMVRBTXZWZU9wRVFOUmRraG1ZSTZqM05DLWQ3ZENaVENEbkNsWTNqdTVUMnFRMjZDVXl5Wi03b2gxTDBCTkp1UXFEQVZ0TWhscV9JTm91YXlkeXh4bTVkUzNWV1R1ZmduSEd2TDhoVzROS3drcGlMWE55S29FQjA2UE5jbE1YVnBySUM1YTEtSmowa3A4RWdMbV9tdnd0Nzk1S2NpeEstRzFoWHc?oc=5,"Mon, 05 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","For many Americans, Nevada brings to mind stunning natural beauty and—for most, of course—Las Vegas, the country’s entertainment capital. What the state has not been well known for is its manufacturing industry, but that may be changing. Since 2017, when electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla opened its 5.8 million-square-foot (538,800 sq m) battery manufacturing facility in the desert outside Reno, Nevada, state officials have made efforts to grow the burgeoning industry in hubs statewide. The expansion has led to a rush of interest and deals in the real estate sector, but despite abundant opportunities, challenges to growth remain. Turning point Ten years ago, Tesla started preliminary work on the company’s facility—dubbed the “gigafactory”—near Reno. The project’s size and scope drew attention from around the globe. Not only was it planned to cover nearly 6 million square feet (557,000 sq m), the project was intended to be a net zero energy building. Tesla also purchased surrounding land in case company leaders decided to expand the facility. The factory will support production of 35 GWh of battery cells every year—roughly enough to allow assembly of 500,000 EVs annually, according to the company. To staff this massive development, Tesla said it plans to hire 6,500 full-time employees over the next decade as it expands the Reno facility, the first to be built in the company’s ongoing gigafactory program. Tesla’s multi-billion-dollar project marks an important moment in the state’s manufacturing industry, which has been expanding rapidly in recent years. According to the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), in 2024, the state’s manufacturing GDP hit $4.5 billion—thanks to Reno alone. Although the state has become a major player in the EV supply chain, particularly in the manufacturing space, Nevada also has many businesses revolving around the production of lithium or products that require lithium, including batteries. GOED identifies advanced manufacturing as one of its key target industries for its State of Nevada Tax Abatement incentive package. The state grants tax abatements to qualifying companies to help promote economic growth and diversification, and prioritizes ones that help drive regional competitive advantage, innovation, and wage gain, among other things. Firms that receive the incentives gain abatements on such things as capital equipment purchases, business taxes, personal property taxes, and recycling. “The package has proven to be an excellent fit for all facets of manufacturing and attracting, promoting, and maintaining a strong, healthy, competitive manufacturing sector,” says Melanie Sheldon, senior director of business development at GOED.                   CapRock Partners recently announced its purchase of 3200 USA Parkway, a 707,010-sq.-ft. (65,683.4 sq m) Class A industrial asset in Sparks, Nevada.       Attracting interest Incentive packages are critical to attracting companies to the state, but other important factors are also at play. Nevada is known as a more business-friendly state, with lower costs for startup, regulatory, licensing, and annual fees, as well as lower taxes and competitive utility rates for commercial operations, according to GOED. In fact, the state ranked seventh in the Tax Foundation’s 2023 State Business Climate, an independent ranking of states in five areas of taxation. What stands out most about the ranking is how it compares to neighboring states that also compete for businesses: California ranked 48th, Arizona ranked 20th, and Idaho ranked 21st. Having an edge over its neighbors has become a big advantage for Nevada. “I think a driver for Las Vegas has been that we’re close to Southern California but not California,” says Rob Lujan, senior managing director for JLL’s industrial team in the brokerage’s Las Vegas office. For many companies, across the real estate spectrum, looking to plant a flag on the West Coast or even to move out of Southern California in search of a lower-cost market, Las Vegas’ geographic location has been a big driver in its growth. Now, manufacturers seek to do the same thing, Lujan says: “Lease rates have skyrocketed in California, but in Nevada we are less expensive, the transit costs are cheaper, and labor is less expensive.” Major markets in Nevada, such as Reno and Las Vegas, are less than a day’s drive to 60 million customers and five major US ports serving the Pacific Rim, according to GOED—a big selling point for companies in search of distribution centers. Nevada also has more than 7,500 acres (3,035 ha) of flexible, available Foreign Trade Zones—secure areas supervised by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that are referred to internationally as free trade zones, which can offer advantages to manufacturers and other types of companies through lower duty fees, taxes, and international shipping costs.                   Apex Industrial Park was created to be a sprawling manufacturing hub in North Las Vegas that spans 18,000 acres and has planned industrial developments by Prologis, Dermody Properties, and CapRock Partners.       Path to growth Numerous major industrial parks have been built recently and land has been rezoned for industrial use to accommodate companies planning to expand or relocate their manufacturing operations. The Apex Industrial Park was completed earlier this year, about 20 minutes drive north of Las Vegas. Spanning 18,000 acres (7,300 ha), the project was envisioned to be a massive manufacturing hub and was in the works for decades. Now, several high-profile industrial real estate developers, including Prologis, Dermody Properties, and CapRock Partners, are all building projects at the site. As of November 2023, there are six  large projects underway  at Apex that total 9.8 million square feet (910,000 sq m). CapRock, an industrial developer and owner based in California, started expanding into Arizona and Nevada markets back in 2017. Since then, the company has steadily built up its Las Vegas portfolio to more than 4 million square feet (372,000 sq m) of space, whether acquired, built, or entitled, says Taylor Arnett, senior vice president of acquisitions at CapRock. “We’ve found that Nevada is really a great place to invest, especially [by] being an overflow market for California,” Arnett says. “Development regulations are more streamlined, quicker—it’s easier to entitle designs and develop industrial buildings.” CapRock’s latest purchase in Nevada happened in July, when it acquired a 700,000-square-foot-plus (65,000 sq m) distribution warehouse property in Reno. Despite all the growth and promise of the state’s industrial and manufacturing industries, however, various factors could still hamper further expansion. For one, Nevada has long confronted water shortages. With demand for water expected to rise as the state targets growth in batteries, renewable energy, and other green technologies, Nevada officials have been focusing on water conservation and developing new, smart infrastructures and technologies to help scale those efforts, according to GOED. One of the biggest barriers, though, is that most of Nevada’s land is owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Just over 80 percent of the 56.2 million acres (22.7 million ha) of land in Nevada is federally owned and managed by BLM, meaning a scarcity of private land remains for development of more industrial and manufacturing facilities. A partnership of developers, brokers, and industry groups such as NAIOP is pushing the government to release BLM land for future development, however, especially given the rate of population growth in such cities as Las Vegas, according to JLL’s Lujan. “The focus is for Nevada to continue to realize its vision for the future,” says GOED’s Sheldon. “[Namely,] a sustainable, innovative, and connected economy with high-paying jobs for all Nevadans. Nevada’s unique economic assets—from its competitive business environment and nascent innovation ecosystem, to natural resources and geographic location—make it primed for explosive growth in the years ahead and [to be] a cornerstone of national security.” Learn more about development opportunities in Nevada at the 2024 ULI Fall Meeting."

It would leave most muscle cars, and even some purpose-built dragsters, eating its dust. Achieving this level of performance takes immense power and unwavering grip. Plus, the Roadster's cutting-edge battery technology and sophisticated powertrain make it a force to be reckoned with on the drag strip. The Tesla Roadster's 0 to 60 and quarter-mile times demonstrate its ability to not just compete but dominate in the world of high-performance vehicles.                Tesla Roadster In Action                                  Tesla          There's no sugarcoating it: the  $50,000  reservation fee for the Roadster is almost unheard of in the automotive world, and it speaks volumes about the high demand and exclusivity surrounding this car. The hefty reservation fee alone will guarantee that this Roadster will only be available to a select few. Still, the $50,000 reservation price adds to the allure of what  Tesla is promising  to its prospective drivers. If you're in the market for something truly one of a kind, reserving the Roadster might just fulfill your needs.

Take the Model 3 Performance, for example; it has 60 miles less range than the  Model 3  Long Range with rear-wheel drive. Based on the claims, the Tesla Roadster can cover an extraordinary  620  miles on a full charge, despite its unmatched performance. It tackles one of the main concerns with modern-day EVs—range anxiety—by delivering a range capacity that no other competitor can come close to reaching. This extended range would allow for long road trips and spirited drives without constantly worrying about finding a charger.                            10,000 Nm: Unbridled Torque                                       Tesla          There were gasps when the Tesla Roadster was revealed with  10,000  Nm (7,375 lb-ft) of torque. That  number is actually wheel torque , which differs substantially from engine torque. It's still a towering number, though, and helps the Tesla deliver its shattering acceleration. This is possible thanks to the car's electric motors, which deliver instant torque from a standstill, propelling the Roadster forward with unmatched urgency. If the final product delivers this promise, its wheel torque will serve as a look into the future of electric powertrains moving forward.                            4: Pace And Practicality                                       Tesla          Unlike many other supercars that focus solely on the driver, the Roadster seats  four . This adds  practicality and versatility  to its performance-focused design. Now, you can share the thrill of the ride with friends and family, creating lasting memories. While the rear seats are still cozy, they're a valuable addition for a car of this caliber, broadening its appeal and usability. Based on the images shared so far, we assume that rear legroom and headroom will be limited in the Roadster. Expect a space that is only really suitable for children.                            250: Hit New Speeds                                       Tesla          Oh, and in case you think this car didn't already do enough, its top speed of over  250  mph puts the Roadster in  hypercar territory . Simply put, it's expected to be a testament to its aerodynamic design and the immense power of its electric motors. Even still, the Roadster's anticipated performance isn't just about quick acceleration; it's also about reaching mind-blowing top speeds, pushing the boundaries of what's possible for an electric vehicle. We're excited to witness this firsthand.                            250,000: Sky-High Founders Series Price                                       Tesla Roadster          The reservation price should tell you that the Roaster isn't going to be cheap. It's expected to start at around $200,000, going up to  $250,000  for the Founders Series edition of the Roadster. This will make it the most expensive new Tesla when it goes on sale. However, looking at its performance, the Roadster is a bit of a bargain, relatively speaking. It gets close to the Rimac Nevera in many key performance metrics, yet the Never costs over $2 million. Like the Plaid Teslas, this one delivers incredible bang for your buck."

"Tesla Removes $50,000 No-Resale Policy For The Cybertruck - CarBuzz",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE12bnN5SXJqUTBsSmthcnJZNFZxWjdtcjRUOUlZTkNHYzhUMkNaWFJra19iYTFJNHNJVjlWeXpqdjRFZkVvLTR3ZEh1VHRKS2pCZ2ZJbHNlWWV2N1BfcTVnZEt2WlA?oc=5,"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Summary                                                Tesla has reportedly removed its no-resale policy for the Cybertruck.                                                                     The policy previously included a potential $50,000 penalty and restrictions on ordering new Tesla models.                                                                     Sales of the Cybertruck are increasing, but the automaker is aware that more affordable variants are needed.                                    The Tesla Cybertruck is a hot commodity, with fans of the polarizing truck clamoring over each other to get their hands on the electric pickup. In fact, earlier this year, a  dealership attempted to flip a Cybertruck for a whopping $290,000  - $170,000 more than the list price. To prevent this, Tesla introduced a clause that prevented customers from selling their Foundation Series variants within a year of taking delivery.   This wasn't just a gentleman's agreement;  the no-resale policy  stipulated that Cybertruck owners who broke the contract would have to pay a penalty of $50,000 or more. But now it seems the all-electric automaker has removed the section from the purchasing agreement. Does this mean Cybertruck owners are now free to sell their vehicles?                     Engine        									 										 											Electric  										 																	           Horsepower        									 										 											600-845 hp  										 																	           0-60 MPH        									 										 											4.1 seconds  										 																	           Top Speed        									 										 											112 mph  										 																	           Towing Capacity        									 										 											11,000 pounds  										 																	                                          Threats Of The Old Cybertruck Resale Clause                   It certainly seems that way. The updated policy comes as changes have been made to the Cybertruck configurator. No longer are customers required to place a reservation order, but can rather configure their electric trucks to their exacting specifications. While the previous policy may not seem fair - after all, people should be able to do what they want with their vehicles - Tesla implemented the rule to protect other customers and the resale value of its high-demand vehicles.            	  						Google News 			       Add CarBuzz to your Google News feed.       Aside from the hefty financial penalties, Tesla has even banned customers from ordering additional vehicles, as a punishment of sorts. The automaker also noted that it had the right to cancel any order it believed had ""been made with a view toward resale of the vehicle or that has otherwise been made in bad faith."" What's more, Tesla would keep the order deposit and fee, along with the transportation fee.         ""Tesla may seek injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the vehicle or demand liquidated damages from you in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater. Tesla may also refuse to sell you any future vehicles.""       - An excerpt from Tesla's former Cybertruck resale clause.         Sales Of The Cybertruck Are Increasing, But...                   It's possible that Tesla no longer has a need for a no-resale policy. So far, more than 16,000 examples have been sold, which is impressive considering it now has a six-figure starting price. It's one of the best-selling electric trucks on the market, besting even the  Ford F-150 Lighting  in recent months, but it must be said that those figures are a far cry from the 2 million pre-orders the Cybertruck had when company CEO Elon Musk said it would cost around $40,000.         Related     Tesla's cheapest Cybertruck variant has disappeared.            More affordable models are needed now , not in a few years. Customers are less likely to spend over $100,000 on a truck that is now readily available (delivery is between September and December). Tesla is also increasing production of the Cybertruck, hopefully allowing the automaker to finally meet demand and fill outstanding orders, but if cheaper versions don't return soon,  Ford may gain the edge in a couple of years . Without this clause, there may be more interest in the wacky truck, but for how long?  Porsche has forced 911 S/T customers to lease their vehicles  for a year before buying them, to prevent  pesky car flippers  from getting their hands on the desirable limited edition, but the desirability of low-volume 911s is never in question.

"Save Up To $2,500 on a New Tesla with Revived Referral Program (Updated) - CleanTechnica",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOenRoVXBzVUQ0ZTJQakgtdHhzNGZyZmdJTEUxc1dRaU9DX2FDLUN2bUlzSW1fTVFYZkQzdFlPTFJVN01Mb1RobDZObkstd1ozckJJWjNubVV2eVZTTDFKdHF0Mm1vaW9tR1ltWEEtaWNheXd4bzBNb0tLd1licE5DV1QwSUVVeEZLV0hrWU9LbFlDVjd3d1JoWDJ3Z3bSAaIBQVVfeXFMTk9GVXdEQVpCRHpnVnJ5ZWFDb09NLVZudk5KcUlqdG1oTmp4aVZsWVFXdmpDMGhUWjQ3ZU5KeVlDZTExb01keVB6Mk4xZC1JTVFfMnV5S1FXRU51RGkwOGZqRl9xbDE2djkxR3dxNHFGeHZXUHBpbFk2TFI1bnpGbDYxVFVDallzSXd6WkFfNHNicDZzU1hwZmt4YXBUaHlMMjlB?oc=5,"Sun, 25 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Sign up for  CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries , sign up for  our daily newsletter , and/or  follow us on Google News !       Last Updated on:  7th February 2025, 11:15 am    When Tesla discontinued the referral program earlier this year, Elon said it would be back. The company has made made good on that promise, and now Tesla car buyers can save up to $2,500 on a new Tesla car purchase when they use a referral code or referral link. The referrer gets a $500 credit toward merchandise in the Tesla shop, a new car purchase or even service or maintenance performed at a Tesla service center and the buyer gets an instant discount off a special order or inventory Model 3, Y, S, X or CyberTruck.   UPDATE (February 1, 2025)  – Tesla has increased the referral or loyalty discount on Model 3 from $500 to to $2500.  CyberTruck is also now available for a $1000 referral discount. Use one of the below referral links (or one from a friend of family member) to save $1,000 off the purchase price of a Tesla Model S, Model X or CyberTruck, $500 of a Tesla Model Y (excluding Launch Series) or $2500 off any Model 3.   If you need a referral code for the discount, feel free to use any of our referral links (some may have already reached the referral cap, so just try the next one down until you see the discount appear on screen after clicking the link):     Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Christopher55570)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Steve81051)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Kevin51692)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (John49040)   Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,500 on a new Tesla Model S, 3, X, Y or Cybertruck (Brian33170)     As the company did previously, Tesla has included a cap on the number of referrals a Tesla owner can make in the new program. Only the first 10 referrals from a single person will earn the buyer and the referrer the referral reward in a calendar year.  And while a referrer can refer up to 10 buyers per year (and the buyer and referrer will get the credit), the company is capping the number of “loyalty rewards” (where you use your own referral code to buy a new Tesla) to 10 referrals “per lifetime.” Tesla has been known to modify the terms and conditions of its referral program without warning or notification, so it’s best to check the “ Terms and Conditions ” page on the Tesla web site for details.     As a regular referrer myself, I will say it’s nice to see that the referral rewards can be applied toward actually useful things like a new car purchase, Tesla merch or even service and maintenance expenses. I still have a chunk or Reward Credits from the previous version of the program that I haven’t used yet, but I expect these new referral credits will come in handy in the future.  According to Tesla, Referral Rewards do currently expire 1 year after they are earned, though there is currently no expiration date visible in the “Tesla wallet.”   Is the Tesla CyberTruck, Roadster or Tesla Solar Eligible for the Referral Discount?   Yes! As of November, 2024, Tesla has added CyberTruck to the list of eligible vehicles and is currently offering a $1,000 discount on Cybertruck purchase with a referral code or referral link. The current referral reward applies toward the purchase of a Tesla Model S ($1,000 discount), Model 3 ($2,500 discount), Model X ($1,000 discount), Model Y ($500 discount) or CyberTruck ($1,000 discount). The Model 3 was previously ineligible for referral bonuses (with the redesign) but it is again eligible for referral rewards in the new referral program. The Tesla Roadster 2.0 is not currently eligible for rewards. But Tesla did add Solar Panels and Powerwall back into the referral program in late 2024.   Who Can Get a Tesla Referral Code or Referral Link?   Any person who owns a Tesla car and lives in a region that is eligible to earn referral rewards can refer a new customer to Tesla and get the referral reward. If you are buying a Tesla car and have a friend or family member who owns a Tesla, ask them for their referral code or referral link so you can both earn the reward bonus. Tesla customers can find their referral link in the Tesla mobile app in the “Refer and Earn” link in your the account section (the three lines on the top right of the app screen).  The referral code is usually a combination of the customer’s first name and 5 numbers.   Existing Tesla customers can find details on the Tesla referral program in the “Refere and Earn” section of the Tesla mobile app.   What Does the Referrer Get?   As of February 1, 2025, the Tesla customer who successfully refers a new person to buy a Tesla Cybertruck, Model S, Model 3, Model X or Model Y earns $500 toward Supercharging, software upgrades, merchandise, service payments or the purchase of a new Tesla for each person they refer who takes delivery.  A referral for Tesla solar earns the referrer a $250 credit in Tecla Bucks. The referral will show up as “Ordered” in the Tesla app until the buyer takes delivery of his or her car. Upon delivery, then the status changes to “delivered” and the credit appears in the referrer’s Tesla Wallter. The first 10 people who order a new Tesla car using the referral link (per year) will receive an instant discount off the purchase price of a Model S, X or Cybertruck, Model 3 or Model Y (not including Model Y Launch Edition). Tesla’s referral program is currently capped at 10 referral rewards per referrer per year.   The Bottom Line   Tesla has never been big on marketing or advertising, but they have been effective at driving new customers by tapping into the loyalty and enthusiasm of current Tesla owners with the Tesla referral program. Despite the CEO’s online antics,  Tesla still leads the automotive sector for brand loyalty , with 87% of Tesla owners saying they plan to buy another Tesla. By offering useful rewards like a discount on the purchase price of any Tesla car and even service credits and free Supercharging for current customers, Tesla should be able to stimulate sales with this revised program.   >  Tesla Referral Link – Save Up To $2,000 on a new Tesla Cybertruck, Model S, 3, X or Y (note: if this link is maxed out, see additional referral links above)   Related Reading:   Tesla Referral Program FAQ (updated)   Tesla Leads Automotive Sector with Highest Brand Loyalty  (2024 Study)       Whether you have solar power or not, please complete  our latest solar power survey .

Donald Trump is a big fan of Elon Musk and Tesla's 'incredible' electric cars — but not all EVs - qz.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE9aUGRxdFltcWNqN1RCYk5DVE1YZmFvNGJwZWZuQnhja1EwQ0tlby1oQnE2U1ByM2oxdHU0MExSMnRCeWlHLUN3REtuTy0zczJSRS1VSDJRM3ZsbkgxLXhNNmg1MkRSUy1LYU1HSmNCZkF6YkZxYkZqUDQ3WlY?oc=5,"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Former President  Donald Trump  on Monday complimented  Tesla  CEO Elon Musk’s “great product” —but maintained his opposition to the electric vehicle industry.  How Trump’s tariffs could make your iPhone cost $3,500 “That doesn’t mean everybody should have an electric car, but these are minor details, but your product is incredible,” Trump said Monday evening during a roughly  two-hour conversation  with Musk on Musk’s social media platform X. It was just the latest instance of Trump expressing his admiration and support for Musk, who has  endorsed  the Republican presidential nominee and launched a super PAC  working to aid his candidacy . But that sentiment doesn’t extend to the broader electric vehicle industry, which is worried a possible Trump administration  would gut his predecessors’ push away from vehicles that run on gas . In the past, Trump has said  electric cars  will “kill” the U.S. auto industry and labeled automakers’ moves to produce more EVs a “ transition to hell . While his rhetoric has softened somewhat in recent months, he claimed as recently as last month that ending a  so-called mandate on EVs  would save the auto industry from “complete obliteration.” “I’m for electric cars. I have to be because, you know, Elon endorsed me very strongly,” Trump said during a Georgia rally earlier this month. “ So, I have no choice .”   1/1             Skip  Ad       Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser website GO TO PAGE At that rally, he clarified that he supports EVs as a “small slice” of the larger auto industry, which he wants to have “every kind of car.” Trump has rallied against a recent federal rule on tailpipe emissions that was favored by  automakers , repeating an oil-lobby claim that it is an EV “mandate” that bans gas-powered cars. Trump has also promised to put a freeze on the grants included in President Joe Biden’s   Inflation Reduction Act , which helped push companies to invest $124.7 billion in clean energy projects since it was passed in August 2022, including some $77.6 billion in EV projects, according to  Manufacturing Dive .  Pro-EV advocates are also concerned that Trump would do away with the $7,500 tax credit for EVs, which has helped persuade consumers to make the switch to electric.  As of May, EV buyers have  saved $600 million  since January on buying new electric cars, according to the Treasury Department. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, has  submitted legislation  to remove the EV tax credit and replace it with a similar credit for gas-powered cars.  While doing away with the federal tax credit could hamper EV adoption rates and sales for automakers, Musk has expressed his support for removing all subsidies on the auto industry. During an  earnings call  last month, he said  doing away with the IRA tax credits “probably actually helps Tesla  TSLA +1.13% ” in the long term because it would hurt rivals. After poor sales last quarter, Tesla’s  share of the EV market sank to below 50%  for the first time since it rose to the top."
"Tesla models, prices, charging, stock: A complete guide to the electric vehicle maker - Business Insider",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTkFVX3lxTE9mQVZxRFNLNk1oSTZjSzVDVkZnbkQ3V2VtWWtETEZQN2ZZQ3RjXzFVdXRRZERPc3R0R3R4YXUyTEFQME5KbnVpNHlkTmsyZw?oc=5,"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Since Tesla was founded in 2003 and its IPO in 2010, Elon Musk's electric-car company has contended with high highs and low lows. And throughout  Tesla's history , the automaker managed to put electric vehicles on the map and become the most valuable car company on the planet.   Working at Tesla   Tesla CEO Elon Musk  has led the company to outperform traditional automakers over the last few years.   But that doesn't mean the carmaker is immune to economic headwinds. Tesla has been through periods of rapid growth — and numerous rounds of  Tesla layoffs , with the most recent in 2024 seeing over  10% of Tesla's workforce laid off .    Musk has also been very critical of work-from-home and starting in the summer of 2022, all but killed the  Tesla WFH  policy, telling executive staff that they needed to return to the office or resign.    Musk officially moved  Tesla headquarters  from California to Austin, Texas in December 2021. However, it still employs thousands of workers in California. In February 2023, Musk said the company was moving into office space in Palo Alto that was previously occupied by Hewlett-Packard.    Tesla has six gigafactories in the US, Europe, and Asia, where it builds batteries and electric vehicles. Musk spoke at Tesla's 2022 annual meeting about wanting to 10 to 12 more in the next several years. Expanding the  Tesla gigafactory  network would boost the company's manufacturing capabilities.    TSLA Stock   Tesla's stock price was essentially flat for several years after its 2010 IPO. But in 2013, Motor Trend named the Model S its Car of the Year. At that point, Tesla's share price took off. If you bought  Tesla stock  right after the IPO and held on, you'd be looking at a 1,000%-plus return.   Tesla revenue  was $96.8 billion in 2023, with $78.5 billion of that coming from sales of its EVs. The company also makes money from its energy business and through selling regulatory credits to other automakers — a side hustle that earned Tesla nearly $1.8 billion in 2023.    Investors have recently been most concerned about price cuts, a lack of new vehicles, and Musk's commitments at his other companies.   The latest  Tesla earnings  call in July 2024 revealed overall revenue rose 2% to $25.5 billion, but operating profit fell 33% to $1.61 billion, $200 million below estimates.   Along with the rest of the auto industry, Tesla's business has been hit by the slowdown in EV sales. Musk told investors in January 2024 that the automaker was ""between two major growth waves.""     Tesla products   From least to most expensive, the  Tesla models  are Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X. The names of the models spell out the word ""S3XY."" Leave it to Musk to sprinkle in some juvenile humor wherever possible.    The company also sells the  Tesla Cybertruck , a futuristic pickup truck that it began delivering to customers in 2023, and the  Tesla Semi , an 18-wheeler that was released in 2022 and is Tesla's first commercial vehicle.    The Model 3 and Model S are sedans, while the Model Y and Model X are SUVs. The vehicles fall in a  price range  of $38,990 to $94,990. Because Tesla sells direct to consumers, its prices have been known to change.   The entry-level Tesla  Model 3 cost  is one that often fluctuates. The current starting price is $38,990, with some Model 3 versions eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit in the US.    Tesla's Model S , a luxury family sedan, is the EV maker's oldest vehicle still in production. It costs nearly $75,000 for the most basic version, and Tesla claims it's the most aerodynamic production car on Earth. Tesla delivered the first Model S to a customer in June 2012.    For a buyer comparing  Tesla Model 3 vs. Model S , the Model 3 will be more accessible to more buyers because of its lower cost. For drivers looking to splurge, the Model S delivers a high-end luxury vehicle with more space and better performance than the Model 3.    The  Model X SUV  is the biggest and most expensive vehicle Tesla sells to everyday drivers. At a starting price of $79,990, it comes with five seats, but you can pay extra for a third row with six- or seven-seat layouts.   The Model X's falcon-wing rear doors swing up instead of out, making it look like some kind of spaceship. The all-wheel drive version of the Mode X is eligible for the $7,500 tax credit in the US, but the more expensive Plaid version is not.    Tesla's smaller SUV is the  Model Y , which is one of Tesla's cheaper offerings alongside the Model 3 sedan. It starts at $44,990 before tax incentives, and recently became the best-selling vehicle in the world.    The Cybertruck  is the newest addition to Tesla's vehicle lineup. The space-age pickup has a stainless steel body and comes packed with futuristic features. It's also extremely pricey, with the cheapest Cybertruck starting at just under $100,000 — though Tesla has said cheaper versions of the Cybertruck will be coming next year.   EV features   Some  Tesla features  are what you might expect from a modern electric car, like the app and keycard. Others reflect Musk's unique sense of humor and have added to Tesla's cult following. While Autopilot gets a lot of attention, the cars come equipped with many more, including the ""frunk,"" ""Dog mode,"" and ""Ludicrous Plus Mode.""

Tesla interiors  were among the first to cut the instrument cluster and introduce a steering yoke.   Tesla's Full Self-Driving software beta was first released in 2020 and is now available to anyone who pays for the software upon request.  Tesla FSD  is not self-driving, despite the name. The tech enables Teslas to automatically change lanes, enter and exit highways, recognize stop signs and traffic lights, and park.   Charging and batteries   Superchargers are the fastest way to charge a Tesla and the closest you can get to gas station-like refueling times. The company says the best Superchargers can add 162-200 miles of range in 15 minutes.   The company offers a  Tesla Supercharger map  where users can look up locations of chargers. There are more than 50,000 worldwide, up from 10,000 in 2018.   Where possible,  Tesla Supercharger cost  is charged per kilowatt hour (kWh) used. Where Tesla is unable to bill per kilowatt hour, they will instead charge a per-minute fee. To access the Tesla network as a non-Tesla owner, you will need the Tesla smartphone app.   A  Tesla destination charger  lets users charge their cars at locations like hotels, malls, and restaurants. Unlike Supercharging, destination charging is designed more for overnight stopovers or to stay topped up while running errands, as opposed to short breaks in a road trip.    There are ways to charge your Tesla without stopping to charge — some are more realistic than others. One YouTuber's experiment involved a  Tesla with a generator , powering his Model S during an 1,800-mile road trip through the Midwest without stopping to plug in. (He did have to stop for gas for his generator, ironically.)   How long does it take to charge a Tesla  at home? A full charge can be achieved in 8 to 10 hours if you install a 240-volt outlet, like the kind used to power clothes dryers. You can also charge with a $230 Tesla mobile connector plugged into any standard outlet and get from three to 30 miles of range per hour charged.   Tesla guarantees its batteries for eight years or 100,000-150,000 miles, whichever comes first. The  cost of Tesla battery replacement  would be steep. In 2019, Elon Musk put the cost between $5,000 and $10,000.    EV competitor comparisons   Tesla isn't the EV game in town, with new competitors popping up all the time. But are any worth considering over a Tesla?   One up-and-coming electric car brand gunning for some of Tesla's success is Polestar. The Tesla Model 3 competes directly with the Polestar 2. Putting  Tesla vs Polestar  head to head reveals that the brands have a lot in common, including online ordering, simple interiors, and an emphasis on performance. The Polestar 2 has a more user-friendly touchscreen setup and is more expensive.  Rivian, one of the most successful electric vehicle startups in the US, is another Tesla competitor. The Tesla Model X and Cybertruck pickup compete with Rivian's R1T pickup and R1S SUV. When comparing  Tesla vs. Rivian , Rivian, whose brand is all about getting outdoors, is catering to buyers who want a larger vehicle and better off-road capability. Tesla's cars are more about on-road performance, and they deliver that in spades, particularly if you choose a sportier model, like the  Tesla Model S Plaid . Lucid is a promising EV startup based in California. Lucid's CEO, Peter Rawlinson, was previously a top engineer at Tesla. Lucid's entry-level Air Pure starts at $75,225 before taxes and fees. The model's pricing goes all the way up to $249,000 for the Air Sapphire, a super-powerful speed monster.   In a Tesla vs. Lucid matchup, Tesla's closest competitor would be its Model S sedan, which also delivers tons of range, awe-inspiring quickness, and lots of advanced technology.    Future products   EV fans are patiently waiting on several  future Tesla models , including a new roadster, a cheap EV, and a self-driving taxi. Many of these vehicles have already faced long delays.   Tesla is expected to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi in October. Musk has been promising that Tesla will release a self-driving vehicle since 2019, when he said the company would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the following year.    The billionaire has said Tesla's driverless taxi business will function like ""a combination of Airbnb and Uber,"" and tied the automaker's future to its ability to cr"

More “See-Saw Effect” with Tesla FSD 12.5.3 - CleanTechnica,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxON0lsaDVVN0NLRkZ2OWNVNVNGRHdVV0JYSGl3RkwzSktnZExuVmdyeWNJc2RKakpmaWNhYXpaUjlfYlJDWmkybnZPTHdObnlkS2lKU25VQ0QwVG84eU0ybnVZc0NWTUFPLUR1WnZhdGwtQkZVbmNzczgtT1hkT0hxMmhYN3dSZ9IBiwFBVV95cUxPN2pCb084SF9hbG9nWFBOUlpUVjlWS2x5TzA0UElnSnJ4RE1Sa0k2ZGxLSzhtejVfWmFzNGJlSEE5UXdkbndIallYT1dZUk53T1pBRWYxOFltUTl5eDU2WmhkMDZTM2xkYTdYdmNkVVZLLXV4TEZKVjBhb0FGSjUyYTkzOUN2NV9VOVFJ?oc=5,"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 12:40:54 GMT","Sign up for  CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries , sign up for  our daily newsletter , and/or  follow us on Google News !       I wrote the other day about Tesla “Full Self Driving” (FSD) reportedly getting much better with the 12.5 update. As I explained in that piece, I normally don’t go by what other people are saying on this because my history with doing that was massive disappointment and a tremendously different experience with FSD when I used it. However, in this case, there seemed to be broad and objective praise for the update. Also, Tesla has decided to delay updates on older Teslas without the latest FSD hardware, and my 2019 Model 3 doesn’t have the latest hardware. So, I’m going to be delayed testing the latest versions of FSD myself.   While initial reports on FSD 12.5 seemed positive, another user provided a short review that seems to bring us back to that “see-saw effect” theory I put out there years ago and  Elon Musk recently confirmed . This FSD user and  CleanTechnica  reader  noted :   “5.3 is much worse than 5.2. On 5.3 it’s lost the ability to handle highway entrances and exits. On entrances its super hesitant, gotten a lot of angry horns as it just sits there. On exits, it wants to drive right past them. The nav voice knows that it’s an exit, the car has gotten over to the right hand lane so it was preparing for an exit, but when it gets to the exit it tries to drive past it forcing you to take over. It also mishandled a merge where it was supposed to get onto the highway, it tried to take an exit instead of. 5.2 was handling these situations correctly. Hope 5.4 shows up soon.”   Again, this is one user’s experience. This isn’t everyone’s necessarily happening to everyone, and we don’t know if it’s common or rare. However, it’s a clear sign that we’ve got another case of “2 steps forward and 1 step back,” or something like that. It’s also a case of, “what the heck happened?” Why did the latest update suddenly cause this problem?   Because of how much FSD has improved this year, I’m a bit more bullish on Tesla’s approach again. But I continue to be concerned about the see-saw effect, especially due to  how  Tesla is improving FSD — with neural nets and machine learning. While Waymo’s progress is much slower in some regards, it seems the more specific, directed, focused development process helps to avoid such problems — as well as the broader hardware suite.   And that brings us back to my note at the top. I have seen some other FSD users in my case getting quite upset that they are no longer receiving the FSD updates because they don’t have the latest FSD hardware. With this kind of thing, I’m typically not that bothered, but in this case, the promises around this made so many years ago make it all a little less forgivable. Elon Musk didn’t promise a date for robotaxis back in 2016, as some people claim, but he did say the hardware put in cars at the time would be all the hardware needed for robotaxi capability, while also showing estimates of gross profit per mile and gross profit per year from a Tesla robotaxi. However, by 2019, he started predicting such robotaxi capability by “next year.” In my humble opinion, anyone buying a car from then on, and especially going back to those 2016 statements and presentation, was “duped” by these statements. Now, some of those buyers are getting quite upset, and even more so with FSD updates no longer rolling out to them when they roll out to Tesla owners with newer FSD hardware.           There are a series of issues above here, so let me just summarize with a bullet list:     Tesla FSD 12.5.3 has made notable improvements according to some public testers, but it has also made some odd steps backward.   Tesla owners with newer cars and the most recent FSD hardware are now getting updates much sooner than others (and this was announced earlier by Elon Musk).  That said , everyone in the US with FSD hardware built into cars since mid-2019 should still be getting these updates in time.   There’s growing concern that claims about robotaxi hardware, coming robotaxi progress, and potential for robotaxi commercial service and revenue were all not just overly optimistic but wildly off the mark and potentially even very deceitful.     We’ll continue covering the story as more updates, news, and opinions come out, as we have done since 2015.

Tesla takes Sungrow’s crown as lead global producer of battery energy storage systems in 2023 - Wood Mackenzie,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxNWlVfdmE3SWRhTkk0RFdaRzBhRmx0WmZueGtPeGZuWklma2JMUmVLcGV1cTFWemJ6TnZ0YjZxQ21GMGlCbGRRM1NMalhtMk01ZXdoQXhzWDlBWHozRkctZmRDTVk3UWhpd0hrT0szWGdtZTNaZFdjTUpGRkJVV01ZV0ZxNjZsNW9CTlVjd24tZWlabUhJQ2R3RDhWbUNzbHBWcEZUM2Jrb2VTRVh4akx5amg3ZEFqcTVNWm9iYkZhcjBRTzRY?oc=5,"Thu, 08 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Telsa has overtaken Sungrow as lead producer in the battery energy storage system (BESS) integrator market with a 15% market share in 2023, according to Wood Mackenzie’s ‘Global battery energy storage system integrator ranking 2024’ report.   The market share of the global top five BESS integrators shrank to 47% in 2023 from 62% in 2022, with a 24% Year-on-Year (YoY) decline, stated the report.   The global BESS integrator market is becoming less concentrated, mainly due to multiple China-based companies entering the market, with six of the global top 10 vendors China-based. This is partially because the country’s BESS market is exclusively supplied by domestic companies. In addition, China installed the most BESS globally in 2023.   Wood Mackenzie’s  Kevin Shang , principal research analyst, energy storage technology and supply chain, said: “The global BESS integrator market is becoming increasingly competitive, especially in China, resulting in declining market concentration. As a sector with a relatively low entry barrier, the BESS integrator industry has attracted a significant number of new players.”     In the Asia Pacific region, Chinese companies’ dominance in the regional BESS integrator market strengthened in 2023, with CRRC jumping to the top among BESS integrators in APAC largely due to cost competitiveness, followed by Hyperstrong. While XYZ Storage and Envision tied at third place, stated the report.   For Europe, energy storage system integrator market concentration was on the rise in 2023, compared with the relatively fragmented situation in 2022. The top three players, Nidec, Tesla and BYD, accounted for 68% of the European market share in 2023, increasing by 26% YoY.   In North America, Tesla, Sungrow and Fluence remained market leaders in 2023. The three vendors captured 72% of the region’s market share for BESS shipments in 2023, growing 20% YoY in the percentage.   According to the report, market concentration has increased significantly in the North American BESS integrator market in the past year, mainly driven by Tesla, whose market share surged by 60% YoY.   “Tesla has the energy storage industry’s most vertically integrated supply chain, from manufacturing hardware to providing energy storage solutions. This enables Tesla to deliver continued improvements and new features to clients quickly and helps customers maintain storage assets for their entire lifespan,” Shang added. In addition, Tesla has been ramping up production at a 40-GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California.   “Importantly, established companies have also been bolstering their competitiveness in terms of price, performance of products and solutions across all regions,” Shang concluded.   ENDS   Reporting metrics:    Wood Mackenzie ranks vendors by the number of shipments in megawatt-hour (MWh). Only shipments with revenue recognised in the reporting year are counted towards the market share."

Why Tesla Hasn't Built A Second-Generation Model S - CarBuzz,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBBaHpFQVlsaHByZUNrRGUzYTNaa2FIeEhNTTBGcF9nUFZQNHRGRTdYS2hxaGpYTXduTGVXVTkyQlBJejVhQjVPWGpoWkVFem5KQ2tjMWsyNVQtaWZCQjBoZnZ4d0VCT2ptMnUyU19XV1hQbnRKazRPcVN3?oc=5,"Sat, 24 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","The  Model S  is Tesla’s second-oldest model, and the one that propelled it into the mainstream car market, making it a common sight on American roads and turning  Tesla  into a household name. Now that the Model S has passed the ten-year mark, the car world has started to wonder whether the brand has any plans to bring out a second generation. However, the answer to that question is more complicated than it might seem at first, partly because of Tesla’s unique approach to changing and updating models. Let’s explore the history of the Model S so far, and see why Tesla currently has no plans for a Model S 2.0.                            The First 1,000 Cars                   The story of the Model S begins in 2007. At the time, Tesla was a little-known four-year-old startup, two years into producing its very first model, the Roadster. Before being known by its final name, the Model S was developed under the codename “WhiteStar”. At the start, the WhiteStar project was headed by Danish designer Henrik Fisker, who later founded his own,  much less successful  automotive startup. Soon after, clashes began between Fisker and Elon Musk, leading to Franz von Holzhausen being appointed lead designer, while Peter Rawlinson was put in charge of engineering the thing. Rawlinson, now the CEO of Lucid, is the real father of the Model S, and a vocal critic of the company he helped make famous.         Related     Peter Rawlinson sat down with us at the Goodwood Festival of Speed for a wide-ranging discussion on everything that makes Lucid the EV pioneer.           The team worked around the clock in a tent in the SpaceX facility in Texas, and eventually the first Model S prototype was unveiled in California in 2009. Manufacturing began three years later at a former Toyota and GM facility, newly acquired by Tesla in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Production of the Roadster, which had ended six months earlier, had taken place in the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership near San Francisco.   The first 1,000 Model S cars to be produced were given the limited-edition “Signature” configuration, with a single electric motor producing 362 hp and a 0-60 time of 5.6 seconds. There was also a more powerful layout dubbed the Signature Performance, where the motor produced 416 hp and the 0-60 time was slashed down to 4.6 seconds. A total of three configurations were offered for the Model S’ first year: one with a 60 kWh battery, and two with an 85 kWh battery, with specs closely aligned to the Signature and Signature Performance editions.                            The Arrival Of The P85D                   The first substantial changes arrived during the Model S’ second model year on the market. In 2014, the high-performance P85 variant was discontinued, with the  P85D  being introduced as its replacement. The “D” stood for “dual”, as in dual motor: the biggest improvement brought about by the P85D was the addition of a front motor, supplementing the rear-mounted motor used by all previous models. This dual-motor setup has since become the standard for performance EVs, as it provides  all-wheel drive traction  without having a physical connection between the front and rear axle.         Related     The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N and Tesla Model 3 Performance are democratizing power and proving EVs can be fun to drive.           The result was an all-wheel-drive powertrain and a higher power output of 691 hp. This propelled the P85D from 0 to 60 in just 3.2 seconds. A year later, in 2015, the 70D (equipped with a 70 kWh battery, hence the name) was introduced as a replacement for the 60 kWh variant, with a combined output of 514 hp. A single-motor version with this battery pack was also available.   The 85 kWh battery was replaced by a 90 kWh one in 2016, with the 90D and P90D variants replacing the two previous models equipped with the 85 kWh pack. The 90D had a power output of 417 hp, while the high-performance P90D produced a combined output of 762 hp. This resulted in a difference of 1.4 seconds between the two cars’ 0-60 time (4.2 vs. 2.8 seconds).

The 2017 Facelift                   Halfway through 2016, Tesla announced the Model S, now three years old, was going to receive a facelift, with the updated vehicles going on sale for the 2017 model year. The mock “grille” that had characterized the older Model S was replaced by a continuation of the body panels, creating further distance in terms of design and appearance between the Model S and every other car on the market. The goal was no longer to imitate ICE cars and blend in, but to create a distinct, futuristic aesthetic unique to electric vehicles. The headlights were also redesigned, with full LEDs and a mechanism that enabled the headlights to turn with the car for better visibility.         Related     The biggest upgrades you can make to a car using a Wi-Fi connection.            The previously-defunct 60 kWh model was brought back, this time with a new all-wheel-drive dual-motor version dubbed the 60D. Around this time,  over-the-air updates began to gain traction , with Tesla as one of the pioneers: customers had the option to increase the battery capacity of their 60D to 75 kWh with an over-the-air update. This gave the car an additional 40 miles of driving range. However, the 60D didn’t last long after that, being axed at the start of 2017 to make way for more premium, higher-capacity variants. The new 100D and P100D variants, with even larger battery capacity and better performance, were another addition for the 2017 model year.                            A New Lineup                   The next major change arrived two years later, in 2019: Tesla introduced a new, simplified naming convention for the Model S lineup. The 75D, 100D, and P100D were replaced by the names we are still familiar with today: Standard Range, Long Range, and Performance. However, the Standard Range didn’t last very long, being axed later the same year. Over the years, the Model S’ performance kept improving in every single metric, with ever-higher power outputs (the Performance model produced 754 hp at this point) and 0-60 times (under two and a half seconds for the Performance). In 2020, the Long Range Plus replaced the Long Range model, and was the first Model S to break the 400-mile barrier in terms of driving range.         Related     These 10 cars are at the top in terms of range.                                    The Palladium Project And Beyond                   The facelifted Model S had been on the market for just two years when Tesla debuted the next major update; this redesign had been known internally as the “Palladium” project. This overhaul would produce the highest-performing versions of the Model S yet, turning it into the eye-popping, supercar-threatening sedan it’s known as today. The new Model S, introduced to the world in January 2021, had the lowest drag coefficient (0.208) of any car on the market. One of the biggest changes was the introduction of a tri-motor version,  the Plaid . The three motors’ combined power output  broke the four-figure barrier  at 1,020 hp. This resulted in an astonishing 0-60 time of 1.98 seconds. In 2023, the Standard Range model, absent from the Tesla family for four years, was reintroduced to the lineup. While it might be a fair assumption to think the Model S doesn’t have much room for improvement left, Tesla has a way of surprising people, and with the development of increasingly drastic over-the-air updates, they might just have a few more tricks up their sleeve.         Related     In the market for a fast EV and can't decide which one? We're here to help.                                    Conclusion: Are Model Generations A Thing Of The Past?                   To put it simply, the reason why Tesla hasn’t brought out a second generation of the Model S is that it’s already here. The Model S may still technically be in its first generation, but it only resembles the model introduced years ago, with nearly all mechanical components having had major upgrades. So many changes have been made that the Model S you can buy today has very little in common with the one Tesla released a decade ago. Original trim levels and variants were discontinued, and new ones were brought in at a rapid pace.   This has a lot to do with the way Tesla approaches the automotive market: marketing themselves as innovative disruptors, doing things differently from legacy automakers. They introduce changes and updates on a rolling basis, sometimes halfway through a model year, instead of sticking to a rigid schedule. This makes the entire concept of model years and generations almost obsolete, especially in a world where  over-the-air updates  can drastically alter a vehicle that has already been sold and is sitting on the owner’s driveway."

The crash involved three vehicles in the area of Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest Sixth Street just before 4 p.m. Sunday.   The 19-year-old driver of a 2023 Tesla Model 3 was traveling westbound at a high rate of speed on Northwest Sixth Street approaching the intersection at Northwest 27th Avenue, when he collided with the driver of a 2023 Dodge Durango, BSO confirmed.    Investigators said the T-bone-style collision then caused the Durango to strike a 2024 Chevrolet Trax, causing the Trax to roll over onto its roof. Meanwhile, the Tesla and Durango crashed through a chain link fence surrounding a cemetery, where each vehicle came to a final rest, officials said.   Godwin Ogiste, owner of a nearby food truck, witnessed the horrific crash and rushed over to help.    ""It was crazy. I was pulling people out. It was very tragic to see,"" Ogiste explained. ""I see all the smoke. I see all the cars piled up on top of each other. The one car flipped over in the street.""   Several people were taken to the Broward Health Medical Center for treatment and two were pronounced dead, BSO confirmed.   Investigators revealed the driver and a passenger of the Durango were the two people who did not survive, while a third occupant was in critical condition.    The victims were later identified as Lisa Jackson and Geraldine Francis. The person critically injured is a juvenile female, officials said.   Deputies identified the Tesla's driver as 19-year-old Gavin Dorvil, of Lauderdale Lakes, who is facing serious charges.    Broward criminal court records showed Dorvil is being charged with two counts of vehicular homicide and one count of reckless driving.   Broward Sheriff's Office Gavin Dorvil   At last check, Dorvil was still in the hospital being treated for his injuries.   Dorvil's mother told NBC6 that his leg was amputated on Tuesday. She said she didn't know much about what her son was doing.   “He always told me he’s doing business,"" Roseline Dorvil told NBC6 on Tuesday. “... I can tell you yes, he’s a good kid because I don’t know nothing he do.”   His family declined to speak to NBC6 on Wednesday and said they are seeking an attorney.   The Broward Sheriff's Office told NBC6 that they were investigating whether BSO units were pursuing the Tesla ahead of the tragedy. A spokesperson for BSO confirmed that deputies recovered a firearm from the scene, believed to have come from the Tesla.    The BSO spokesperson also said Wednesday that two deputies have been placed on restricted administrative assignment while an Internal Affairs investigation into the incident continues.    Records showed Dorvil had been arrested on July 15 on charges of carrying a concealed firearm, grand theft of a firearm and resisting without violence. He has yet to go before a judge for a bond hearing.   While detectives believe excessive speed was a factor in the crash, they said impairment is not suspected at this time. The circumstances surrounding the crash remain under investigation."

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

Tesla launches textile interior option for Model 3 RWD in Mexico - Teslarati,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5kakUwbnVpV1ItMTdKSWxBU2t6OXRPU2VaMVhGTC03cjN0aUQ5eENJRndKcmdvYS0tYUhBaUppdFhhdWwwN2o2dnJXaDkxM0lwUTZMOGdUSjJORFl5QWtvOVZKMzZWeGtSZHctQkh2R09SeUN1X3dN?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla’s ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) Q1 2025 earnings call comes on the heels of the company’s Q1 2025 Update, which was released after the closing bell on April 22, 2025.     Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

Tijuana fire demonstrates how not to charge your Tesla car - Mexico News Daily,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQa29xRThyNm5rYTJpUkVjSlJNSFhpWjB0TWZfRzlqaldFV01IbURORHBqZjVXWGhyQ0Z2VFdpejdfcXNlR3VZRzU1cEhYdm82YmJyVGhxTVpWSFY5MVE1ZHF5TWNqak1xempOTllWQld1M1NaYmVTVkcxSzVPVnUtY2U4SHhjSDlWMzRfVXczdll6X0l4X0o4ag?oc=5,"Tue, 06 Aug 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Word to the wise: after spending US $70,000 or more to buy a new Tesla Model S, don’t hook it up to an electricity pole in Tijuana to charge it.   That’s exactly what someone did this week, causing a fire Monday morning in the Baja California residential neighborhood that torched an adjacent house and severely damaged the performance-oriented electric vehicle.   There were no injuries, according to officials.   “This is something unusual that we are experiencing for the first time — seeing a Tesla on fire,” said Arturo Sánchez, a coordinator of the Tijuana Fire Department that responded to the blaze.   Social media users were a little less diplomatic about the illegal hookup that caused the fire.   “And what was a Tesla doing in that unpaved neighborhood?” wrote one person. Another said that an illegal hookup to power “Señora Pelo’s little stand with a light bulb and two fryers” is one thing; trying to charge a Tesla is another.   According to preliminary reports from the fire department, the vehicle was stealing power from a public power pole by using an unauthorized and risky connection — known in Mexico by the slang name  diablito,  or little devil .   Some suspicious-looking connections on utility poles in Mexico City. In 2021, the federal government estimated that Mexico’s national power company, the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) loses about US $2.5 billion a year to illegal hookups. (File photo)   Frequently used at construction sites in Mexico before the Federal Electricity Commission has given a building zone power lines and by individuals seeking to avoid electricity bills, a  diablito  can lead to overloaded circuits, dangerous connections, fires and even electrocution.    In 2021, the federal government estimated that the  Federal Electricity Commission loses 50 billion pesos (US $2.5 billion) a year to electricity theft.   According to most media reports, the incident occurred in Tijuana’s Lázaro Cárdenas neighborhood, close to the border between Mexico and the United States, although at least one report placed it near Lázaro Cárdenas Avenue, which is further south in the city.   Sánchez said a fire in a Tesla or any electric vehicle can be extremely challenging for firefighters for two reasons: A large amount of water is needed to extinguish the flames in a car laden with batteries that store power. Plus, in this case, the car was directly connected to high-voltage electricity.   The firefighter noted that his department has been offering training on how to fight fires in such vehicles. Nowadays, he said, “It is essential to know how.”   Sánchez noted that the house that caught fire was uninhabited and that the fire was contained quickly to prevent spreading to other homes. No fatalities or injuries were reported.   It was unknown if the car was a total loss, but it is certain that it was severely damaged.   Several news outlets reported the Tesla belonging to an American tourist, and one, the newspaper La Jornada, wondered why he or she made the illegal hookup “since in Tijuana there are charging stations for electric vehicles.”   Tesla has been in the Mexican news often in recent months,  mainly due to CEO Elon Musk announcing it has “paused” its gigafactory project in Nuevo León , but also due to viral photos of   a Tesla Model 3 being crushed by a huge, stone-carved Olmec head  (not really).   With reports from  El Universal ,  Infobae  and  La Jornada"

Models like the Model S Plaid and Model 3 Performance redefine speed with innovative self-driving capabilities and raw output.                                                                     From the Model Y to the Cybertruck, Tesla continues to push boundaries with impressive acceleration, range, and efficiency.                                    When it comes to straight-line acceleration,  Tesla  has completely redefined what is possible. These electric automotive marvels, dominated by names like the Tesla Model S Plaid and Model 3 Performance, keep breaking records like no other, leaving traditional gasoline sports cars in their dust. The question is not only why Tesla cars are so quick, but also how they are redefining speed altogether.   Tesla's best-performing models rely on an advanced electric powertrain for their swift acceleration.  These new-gen electric platforms  allow for instant torque on the tires, unlike ICEs, which need some time to build up power before delivering peak torque at high RPMs, thus resulting in explosive acceleration from zero. Tesla's intelligent software is added to this formula, which optimizes real-time energy delivery alongside traction abilities, thereby ensuring unprecedented quickness.   Yet, with its innovative  self-driving capabilities  and raw output, Tesla separates itself from the others. Their available all-wheel-drive systems, cutting-edge battery technology, and sleek body shapes make driving fun and thrilling.         In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla. The models are listed from slowest to quickest from 0-60 mph, and the quickest trims for the respective models are considered for the exercise.

Battery EV Review: Tesla Model Y - 14850.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1xVm02S2R3V080eDNVWmRxMi14X2lnZ0syQ01XM1dHZmFYZEpINHlUY0tfdnRoMy14cEJiTFdjcnRqWkxpNVVHcmhNeWZXdGphNXNTRURWZi1aMFRjellka0xFNURtRHhHc3hTRU9CbFNsZGFFOXc?oc=5,"Mon, 30 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","In October of 2023, my trusty 2011 Camry Hybrid was giving ominous warnings about an imminent battery replacement. “Check Hybrid System” convinced me that 12 years was a pretty good run and time to make the plunge into my first all-electric vehicle.  Because of their leadership position and vast charging network, Tesla was the obvious place to start the buying process.   For me, that buying process was a complete online experience.  No trips to a dealership, no walking the lot, no haggling with a salesperson and no more waiting in the show room while the manager was consulted.  Instead I perused an online catalog, selecting models, interior colors, exterior colors, wheel styles, and tow packages.  Prices and potential rebates were updated as I clicked.  I finally settled on a ruby red Model Y, with dual motor AWD, long-range, and the tow package.  The Y has ample cargo space and seemed most appropriate for family use.  The tow hitch means I could add a bike rack to family excursions.   The first thing you’ll notice when driving a Model Y or any Tesla (and what every review dwells upon) is the acceleration.  It is truly impressive and one of the main benefits of the car.  Step on that pedal and the car goes.  And it does not matter whether you are going 0 to 60, 45 -70, or up a steep hill.  The acceleration is there, and it is smooth.  This is great for climbing the hills, highway driving, or moving through intersections.   The other driving feature that I love about the Model Y is its handling.  It takes the curves very well and is just a joy to drive.  I have an occasional 120-mile round-trip commute on winding hilly country roads that I look forward to.   One of the main turn-offs to electric vehicles is their range, or the lack thereof, thus the so-called “range anxiety.”  I get it, it was a serious concern in the weeks leading up to our purchase decision.  I cannot speak for other EVs, but for the long-range Model Y this turned out to be a nothingburger.  One of the first trips we took was from my house outside of Ithaca to my brother’s place outside of Worcester, MA, 300 miles.  Tesla provides a website to plan your trip and any charging that might be needed.  This trip planning capability is also built into the car’s navigation system.  We had several options along the way, but decided to stop at the Crossgates Mall in Albany where the car could charge, and we could get lunch and shop a little.  When we were done with lunch, the battery was charged enough to continue on to our final destination, and by the time we were done shopping, we had almost a full charge.   On the morning that we were to head back, a family emergency forced us to make a detour through Connecticut, then Westchester County, and then home.  This added 75 miles of unexpected travel in a completely new direction.  But it was not a problem.  The planning application quickly charted a route and identified the needed charging locations, another mall in Connecticut and the famous Roscoe Diner for the last leg home.   For day-to-day charging, I installed a Level 2 charger in my garage, which requires a 220V circuit and a robust electric service.  If you have such, this is a great way to keep your car charged.  That 120-mile commute I mentioned earlier can be easily accomplished on an 80% charge.  In the winter, when battery performance is poorer and the seat heaters are cranking, I will charge to 100%.   The Model Y has lots of options for hauling things.  Under the back hatch there is plenty of room for suitcases, bags, groceries, inflatable pool floats, and any of the other routine things you need to move about in family life.  There are two hidden compartments that provide additional storage, deep wells on the sides that can hold all the permanent accessories such as window cleaner, tissues, playing cards, or whatnot, and a frunk (front trunk) big enough to easily hold a roll-aboard suitcase.  When you have to up your hauling needs, the back seats fold down, opening up a large space for your kit.  I recently took the car camping, and with the seats folded down could fit a giant tent, a canopy, cooler, air mattress, table, chairs, and everything else you need to glamp in style.   Tesla Model Y – 14850 Photo by Andy Page   There are some definite things about the Model Y that I would like to see improved, ranging from small conveniences to life safety issues.  Let’s start with the conveniences.  The only USB port that can be used for streaming media is in the glove box.  This is also the only place you can place a thumb drive for dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings.  This was a change from previous production runs, as the center console USB-C port previously had streaming capabilities.  A small note in the online documentation indicates that some cars may not have streaming capabilities from the center console.  As far as I can tell, some means all recent Model Ys.   OK, no biggie, one USB hub later and you can get that media player going.  But another change is a little more problematic, and that is the lack of ultrasonic sensors.  Those sensors used to be included, but in October of 2022 Tesla decided that their camera-based computerized Tesla Vision will eventually be able to replace the ultrasonic sensors.  That’s right, eventually.  Apparently, an over-the-air software update will someday make this true.  But for now, the Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon features are limited or not available at all, as the sensors have already been removed.  The kicker is that you are only informed of this loss of functionality after the purchase has been made.  You are then given an option to cancel your order or accept the reduced functionality.  At least that’s how it went down for me.   Related:  Drive Electric Challenge: Tesla Autopilot vs Ithaca Roads   A driving feature that I don’t love too much is the suspension.  Although there is no engine, the battery pack, motors, and wiring harness all contribute to a total weight of about 4,200 pounds.  The suspension just does not do a good job of cushioning this weight from even the most routine of bumps.  In my Camry, I could easily drive with an open mug of coffee and except when going over railroad tracks, and not have to worry about sloshing java juice.  Not the case with the Model Y.  Even the slightest bump seems to be amplified.  This is unlikely to be improved with an over-the-air update!   But the biggest downside to the Tesla Model Y is the lack of tactile, or physical, controls for basic vehicle functions like climate (heat and AC), radio or other audio, and even windshield wiper settings.  It’s a problem.  After driving the car for nine months, I am a bit shocked that the NHTSA gave this the green light.  The correct areas to touch are very small, and the locations are not intuitive.  This is compounded by the aforementioned poor suspension, as your finger is bouncing around trying to touch just the right place on the screen.  During normal driving, looking at the screen for even a second or two to find the control you need is too long to have your eyes off the road.  Now imagine you’ve entered a sudden downpour, and you need to use the touch screen to set your windshield wipers to high, and things just got dangerous.    So what’s the verdict?  I love driving my Model Y, though I must take extra care to keep my attention on the road.  The lack of tactile controls and the wanton deprecation of features irks me though, and if there were a strong alternative that provided the same range and driving experience, I would not let brand loyalty stand in the way of making a switch.

Tesla - International Trade Union Confederation,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSEFVX3lxTE9jMExodzFtN1lXSk5sejl3VkQ5ZTBrYkNkNVBRem1FcDZkTWd6SjBzemhRLW1fWFB0dk9IOEZIS1NEeHFuVWJfRQ?oc=5,"Mon, 23 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","The world’s most highly-valued automaker has quickly become known as one of its most belligerent employers. Tesla’s rapid market success has been outpaced only by the descent of its corporate leaders into anti-democratic, anti-union politics.    In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the  right to organise ,  refused to engage in collective bargaining , and  provoked unprecedented strike action  for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of  Worst Union-Busters of 2023 . Tesla’s factories have “ reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan  … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.”   But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that  undermine consultation standards  with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,  where child labour has allegedly been employed .   Behind Tesla’s policies, of course, is its CEO, Elon Musk, another of the richest men in history. Musk is open in his opposition to trade unions, saying unionisation  creates “a lord and peasants sort of thing.”  He  illegally threatened  Tesla workers planning to unionise in California with elimination of their company stock options, and  called Swedish workers “insane”  for striking. Musk’s anti-union zeal is apparent in his other holdings as well. SpaceX, where he also serves as CEO and is leading global efforts to privatise outer space, has joined another company on our list, Amazon, to try to have courts  declare the National Labor Relations Board  unconstitutional. The Board has governed disputes between US workers and their employers in the private sector since the 1930s.   While Musk and his companies have  contributed millions of dollars  to influence policymakers around the world, he has become a hero of the far-right. As owner of the social networking platform X (formerly Twitter), he responded to one user’s allegations about a coup in Bolivia – a country with lithium reserves considered highly valuable for electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla – by saying, “ We will coup whoever we want. Deal with it !” He has  committed to donating US$45 million per month  to a political action committee to support the re-election campaign of Donald Trump, and  sought to build close relationships  with other far-right leaders, including Argentina’s Javier Milei and India’s Narendra Modi. Musk has also  re-platformed and clearly expressed his support of white nationalist, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBTQ+ accounts since taking ownership of X."

The Lotus-based Roadster established the brand as a maker of  real cars , so to speak, as opposed to compromised conveyances that sacrificed far too much performance, style, and fun in the name of save-the-Eath bonafides. The Model S established Tesla as a maker of premium vehicles with mass appeal that happened to be electric, and to my eye it remains the best-looking Tesla. And as a luxury sedan, it was even better than most of the offerings out there since it was a hatchback (and even offered a rear-facing seat early on!).   From there, things got a bit strange. The Model X, Tesla’s three-row “SUV,” went with a headroom-cutting fastback profile and needless complex “Falcon” doors. The brand played it safe and achieved greater sales success with the comparatively conservative Model 3 and Model Y, then swung dramatically back to weird with the Cybetruck. I won’t beat the dead horse of how the trapezoid truck is less than ideal as a functional pickup, especially when compared to something like a Ford F-150 or the Maverick that’s piling up on new owner’s driveways to the tune of 100,000 units per month.     The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   Now we’re told that Tesla will be releasing a self-driving “Robotaxi,” and  images from reliable sources  point to something that seems rather unsuited to being a cab. In fact, one of their other products looks a whole lot like a great taxi concept from half a century ago that I’d like to revisit and show how Tesla could make it a reality.   If That’s A Taxi Then I’m Bobby Deniro   Until the Robotaxi is officially revealed on October 10 (fingers crossed, Elon Musk isn’t exactly known for hitting deadlines), anything we say about it now is conjecture. Jason wrote about what is reported to be a  disguised taxi mule  undergoing testing, and it that’s the case this thing will look much like the one seen in Walter Isaacson’s book  Elon Musk.  That concept was a small two-seater (or possibly three across) with scissor doors, rear fender skirts, and a hatchback cargo area in back.     Naturally, this concept raises many questions, the primary one being, “Is he kidding?” How does something this small make sense as a cab? How do you accommodate more than two people and a few smaller bags? Maybe the design team figured that if something is self-driving then it doesn’t need a separate “front seat”. Possibly studies were done to show that very few trips in cabs involve more than one or two people. That’s fine, but what about those other times when they don’t? Do you need to call for a second cab?   Again, we don’t know for sure if this is the Robotaxi. Still, if it is, it looks remarkably like a two-seat Honda Insight, a car that was never, ever considered for cab duty and, to be honest, found very few buyers as a private vehicle as well. There’s a reason for that: two-seaters have very limited usefulness as cars.   The idea of a compact cab is sound, but if that thing really is the Robotaxi then it looks more like a tech bro’s wet dream than something useable as a real cab. Others have shown far better ways of utilizing a small space not much bigger than that could-be Robotaxi. Some of the best examples were literally works of art from almost fifty years ago.   Fine Art (Taxi) Fare   In 1976, before you went out to the disco  wearing your super bad party ring , you might have stopped by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City to see a rather unique exhibit of automobiles. MoMA has beautiful cars like a Pininfarina-designed Cisitalia on permanent display, but the machines in this exhibit were all surprisingly boxy, oddly proportioned and yellow-painted objects. They were taxi cabs.   Museum of Modern Art   These were not just any taxis, but prototypes of what four different companies saw as the cabs of the future. With the fuel crisis just having passed, the curator of the design department at MoMA got a grant from Mobil Oil plus the US DOT and invited manufacturers from around the world to take on the challenge of efficiency, safety, and environmental concerns to develop a working example of a new type of taxi to be shown at the museum exhibit. After that, the prototypes that would be tested by the New York Limousine and Taxi Commission on the horrific streets of  Son Of  Sam- era  Manhattan. Let’s take a look at some of the entries and see where Tesla should have possibly taken some inspiration.   Volvo  Volvo’s entry looks almost  exactly  like you would expect the Swedish firm’s interpretation of a taxi to be, namely a 245DL wagon that’s been pulled in height and squished in length and width.   Volvo   There’s nothing wrong with that, and the Volvo taxi’s interior shows some innovation in the way of a spacious rear seat that uses the lack of front passenger’s chair to allow for wheelchair access.   Volvo   Volkswagen  At first, it looks a bit like Volkswagen phoned in their entry but you shouldn’t be hating just because they already had something in their lineup that filled the bill for the exhibit.   Volkswagen   Besides, there’s much, much more than first meets the eye in this Type 2 “Bus”, namely an early gas/electric hybrid drivetrain. The stock VW air-cooled gas flat four still lives in back, but there’s also an electric motor as well, fed by batteries stuffed seemingly all over the interior of the bus; where the passenger used to sit, under seats, and in the rear cargo area.       Volkswagen   Overall, this one might have been the most prescient about the future of automotive propulsion.   AMF Corportation   Not one but two entries were submitted by super-conglomerate American Machine and Foundry (AMF), a firm that at the time made everything from boats to gardening equipment to bicycles to nuclear reactors (really); they even owned Harley-Davidson from 1969 to 1981 (and nearly ran it into the ground). Oddly enough, the AMF prototypes were both steam powered; there’s an honest-to-God boiler and a two cylinder steam engine in front. It would seem like the idea of heating water might actually work on a vehicle that gets started, warmed up and then runs constantly for eight to ten hours (not that starting a malaise-era carbureted car was a picnic).   You can see the boiler up front in this schematic (AMF seems to have stolen Volvo headrests and Mercedes taillights).     One of the AMF taxi concepts looked a bit like a full-sized Fischer Price Little People school bus where you half expect the driver’s head to pivot from side to side hypnotically like the toy did when in motion:   AMF   The other one started with some swoopy sketches and ended up looking surprisingly like the 1984 Chrysler minivans that arrived a full eight years later.         AMF   Seriously, does that thing not look like a Dodge Caravan Family Truckster?   Alfa Romeo / Ital Design   If you’ve wasted brain cells reading any of my earlier shit on this site worshipping Deloreans, VW Golf MK1s and Lotus Esprits, you won’t be surprised to hear that the taxi concept for the 1976 exhibit submitted by Giorgietto Giugiaro’s Ital Design was my favorite, in this case branded as an Alfa Romeo. This design was a bit like a backward VW Bus, with a flat four from the Alfasud model located ahead of and driving the front wheels. Similar to the Volvo in seating layout with rear-facing jump seats in the passenger compartment, in this case the driver sat cabover-style over the wheels (note the backward-facing manual transmission and bus-length shifter).   Ital Design/MoMA   The styling was pure folded-paper fabulous; clean, functional, and looking a good decade or two ahead of its time. The black-finished rocker panels were like full-surround bumpers, and the lights (plus the stylized Alfa grille) were seamlessly incorporated into these features.     Ital Design   It looks like something that might have been released just a few years ago until you see the period pic below with a woman in a super-seventies getup like your mom would wear proudly only to hide the photos later – some styles will never come back.   Ital Design   It’s funny to see this thing in these Ital Design shots on what looks like the set of CHiPs, looking so modern against the wallpaper seventies American iron. It’s so small but does so much; so versatile.         Ital Design   It was truly a beautiful piece of work. Giugiaro explored this type of product later with civilian-aimed concepts like the Lancia Megagamma of 1978. You might have never heard of this taxi concept, but one look tells you that it influenced many, many later vehicles such as the Renault Espace and Toyota Van.   Ital Design, Toyota,  classic.com   The upper body tapers inwards sort of like a pyramid. Wait a minute? What other vehicle does that, but not even close to this artfully? I’ll give you a clue: it’s available today and it’s always silver unless you wrap it. No, I’m not going to wrap a Cybertruck in yellow vinyl, but I bet you’re thinking what I’m thinking.   Proper Use Of The Box   An angular, box-like shape will typically yield the most space-efficient form, but the Cybertruck proves that isn’t always the case. You can’t reach the bed from the side of the truck, the roofline compromises rear headroom, and the frunk space is minimal.   Tesla   By contrast, Ital Design used the sharp-edged box to its advantage with their taxi. Despite being nearly 50 years old, the overall layout of the Ital Alfa taxi is a study in perfect space efficiency. Passengers sit almost all the way at the back of the cab on a three-wide bench with huge legroom beyond the size of many stretched Town Car limos. Also, rear-facing jump seats in front of them can expand seating capacity to five   Instead of shoving luggage into a trunk or rear hatch, bags can sit in the passenger compartment or, better ye"

Initially, the model was marketed as a luxury executive-level car for families and professionals, but in recent years, it's taken on a more menacing yet playful approach. The 2024  Tesla Model S Plaid  is just about the most capable car available on the market right now, boasting an insane list of performance stats, in addition to genuine daily driver usability. If you're looking to get better acquainted with this most impressive of EVs, we have broken the model down number by number in this article, highlighting the most impressive stats and specs of the car. Everything ranging from the Tesla Model S Plaid's 0 – 60 mph time to the cargo capacity has been covered.         CarBuzz has collected all stats and specs from Tesla directly, unless specified otherwise. This article looks specifically at the Model S Plaid, and not the base-trim Model S, as that has been covered separately.               Related     The Tesla cheats slightly, but the race is still entertaining.                                    1.99: Gone In A Flash                                       Tesla          The 2024 Tesla Model S Plaid is full of party tricks and headline figures, and one such figure is the Model S Plaid's 0 – 60 mph time of just  1.99 seconds . That's a full half second faster than the Tesla Model X Plaid's 0 – 60 mph time, which currently stands at 2.5 seconds.         Model S Plaid has the quickest acceleration of any vehicle in production.         The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport, Lamborghini Revuelto, and Koenigsegg Jesko are all examples of the many supercars that would find themselves chasing the taillights of a Model S Plaid, at least up until 60 mph. Only a very  small number of cars can challenge the 0 – 60 mph time  of the Tesla, all of which are hypercars, apart from the  incredibly specialist Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 . The 0 – 60 mph time of under two seconds is certainly one way of convincing gearheads that EVs are a positive and exciting part of car culture. Plus, the latest Model S Plaid now has the ability to repeat these 0 to 60 runs many more times before performance eventually tapers off            	  						Google News 			       Add CarBuzz to your Google News feed.                                9.23: Blink And You'll Miss It                                       Tesla          This Tesla isn't just quick up to 60 mph either, as demonstrated by its 0 – 100 mph time, which is just 4.19 seconds. Keep going, and the  Model S Plaid will complete a quarter-mile in a mind-blowing time  of just  9.23 seconds . It's widely known that electric cars are quick to accelerate, but 9.23 seconds is seriously quick, even for a Tesla.   In comparison, the Model X Plaid completes the quarter-mile dash in 9.83 seconds, while the Performance-trim Model Y and Model 3 Tesla cars need over 11 seconds to cover the same distance. Bear in mind that the Tesla Model S Plaid's 0 – 100 mph time is just over four seconds, and you can just imagine what speeds you'd be hitting by the time you reach the end of the strip.

Thanks to a tri-motor setup, the rather humble-looking Tesla delivers a monumental  1,020 horsepower , which is distributed to all four wheels.   What's equally impressive is the torque output, rated for all three motors combined at a huge 1,050 lb-ft – or 275 lb-ft more than the most powerful 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning, for some perspective. While the lesser trims of the Model S are still fast cars, they don't make performance the priority. This is where the Plaid differs – it doesn't lack any of the other genuinely useful features of the lower trims, but Tesla, by adding that third motor, has ensured the Plaid is something of a genuine spectacle.         Related     Ever wondered how much it really costs to charge a Tesla? We've got all the answers right here.                                     0.208: Tesla's Sleekest Creation To Date                                       Tesla          Efficiency. It's the word on the tip of everyone's tongues these days, especially when it comes to the topic of running an electric car. In order to boast impressive EPA-estimated ranges, manufacturers must ensure their EVs are as efficient as possible, in every single way.   Well, when it comes to cutting through the air, almost no other car in history is as efficient as the Tesla Model S Plaid. It ranks as having one of the lowest drag coefficients of all time, at just  0.208Cd . How did Tesla manage this? Small things like flush door handles, a flat undertray, and that smooth front fascia all help the Plaid slip through the air with as little resistance as possible.   Not only does this help in terms of performance, as less air resistance is holding the car back, but it also helps in a more practical sense, by maximizing the effectiveness of the battery, in terms of range.                            22: Turn It Up With Tesla                                       Tesla          Although it is the performance stats that catch everybody's attention when discussing the Model S Plaid, the Tesla still does a mighty fine job of everything else, too. As an executive car from a premium brand, the Model S needs to deliver on that premium experience, too. One area in which Tesla definitely delivers, is audio.         A 22-speaker, 960-watt audio system with Active Road Noise Reduction offers immersive listening and studio-grade sound quality.         The Model S Plaid is equipped with a smattering of speakers,  22  to be exact, which ensure awesome sound quality no matter which seat you find yourself in. One plus side of electric cars is that, of course, there is no engine noise to cover up, but the road noise can still be quite intrusive. To combat this, the 960-watt audio system is coupled with smart road noise reduction measures too, to refine the experience.                            64.5: More Than Just Pace                                       Tesla          As a further attempt to demonstrate that speed isn't all the Tesla Model S Plaid is good for, take a look at the cargo capacity available. Thanks to the hatchback-like design, rather than having a traditional sedan-like trunk, the Model S Plaid packs 25 cubic feet of space in the back.   However, fold the rear seats down, and that space swells to a helpful  61.4 cubic feet  of maximum cargo space. With the seats dropped, anything from bikes through to furniture can be hauled in the Model S Plaid. Furthermore, even with the seats in place, Tesla owners have more space to play with than the likes of Lucid Air or Porsche Taycan owners. It's also worth noting that, due to not having to tuck an engine away, the Model S Plaid is extra-handy with an extra 3.1 cubic feet of space available in the frunk.         Related     The Model S has undergone countless changes since its debut. Is a new generation really necessary?                                    21: Make A Statement                                       Tesla          Priced at $89,990, or as Tesla likes to display, $83,490 with 'estimated five-year gas savings' of $6,500 taken into account, the Model S Plaid isn't to be considered a 'cheap' car. Not that it tries to be one either; it's a luxury EV, and so  a hefty price tag is to be expected . Unlike many other luxurious options though, the Model S Plaid doesn't have a hugely long and vastly expensive options list. On the list, customers can spec optional paint colors, such as Ultra Red for $2,500, or Solid Black for $1,500.   However, if they really want to stand out, ticking the $4,500 option for the striking Arachnid  21-inch  alloy wheels is an absolute must. The double five-spoke wheels are finished in a deep anthracite color, and are two inches larger than the standard Tempest wheels. The range with Arachnid wheels does drop slightly, from an EPA-estimated 359 miles to 320 miles, but that's hardly a huge sacrifice.                            359: Plaid Can Go The Distance                                       Tesla         This figure won't be especially useful to those who just want to surprise sports cars at the lights and sample the Plaid's immense power. However, for anyone who genuinely wants to use the flagship Model S as daily transport, it's arguably the most important number. Tesla's high-performance Model S Plaid offers up to 359 miles of range, when equipped with the standard alloy wheels, or 320 miles with those larger, optional, 21-inch Arachnid alloys.   The range is lower than the standard Model S can offer, which is 402 miles, but that is to be expected with the shift of focus from efficiency to performance with the Plaid model. The range is still generous enough to ensure the Plaid doesn't feel like a compromise of power and usability.   Sources:  Tesla ,  EPA"

I Bought Tesla FSD in 2019 Under an Unfulfilled Promise And Think It Should Be Portable - Torque News,https://news.google.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?oc=5,"Thu, 26 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","In 2019, I was an early adopter of  Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) package , hopeful that I was on the cutting edge of automotive technology. Tesla promised that FSD would be available in a matter of months, and I was eager to be part of this self-driving revolution. I was leasing the car and heard rumors from Tesla salespeople about possible transferability, meaning I could take my FSD purchase with me to a future Tesla. I envisioned upgrading my Tesla like I do with my iPhone—every couple of years, I’d get the latest model, and my FSD would follow me. But neither promise came true during the time I owned that car.   In my view, the most logical solution is that FSD should be portable, linked to the driver’s profile rather than the car. All modern Teslas already have the necessary hardware for FSD, so technically, this is something Tesla could implement. It makes no sense to tie such a large, expensive software investment to a single car, especially considering how often Tesla updates and releases new models. Instead, FSD should be something the owner can take with them from vehicle to vehicle. After all, it's not just software; it’s a commitment many Tesla drivers make under the assumption that they’re future-proofing their driving experience. For those of us who believed in that vision early on, it feels frustrating to see it go unfulfilled.   From a legal standpoint, there might be an argument that FSD could be treated as a separate purchase. This is especially relevant when it’s added after the car is bought to qualify for tax credits. For example, the government offers incentives for electric vehicle owners, and if FSD was added to the car separately, that distinction could matter. But Tesla seems more interested in playing the game of maximizing profit than considering fairness to its customers. And to be honest, while I love the cars themselves, Tesla as a company leaves a lot to be desired. The way they handle their pricing has made many of us feel ripped off.   Tesla's price manipulation is one of the most frustrating aspects for owners like me. I had ordered a Tesla Model S Plaid for $148,000, only to see the price drop to $105,000 within a year. Combine that with the depreciation that happens because of their frequent price cuts, and you’re looking at up to a 25% drop in value in just a year. Imagine spending that kind of money only to realize your car is worth $70,000 two years later. It’s hard not to feel betrayed by the company when something like that happens. And this isn’t just about FSD pricing—it’s happening across the board, with Tesla playing fast and loose with their prices, hurting customers financially.   Current Tesla owners who are still considering FSD should ask themselves whether it’s worth the hefty price tag. Tesla may cut prices again, and if FSD remains tied to a specific vehicle, you'll lose that investment if you upgrade or switch cars. Is it fair for something so expensive to become worthless when you trade in or sell your vehicle? Should Tesla offer refunds or credits for early adopters who paid significantly more than what the package costs today? For those who’ve already purchased FSD, it raises a deeper question: Should Tesla be held accountable for changing the terms and expectations after the fact?   As a longtime Tesla owner—I’m currently on my third Tesla and have two in my garage right now—I feel conflicted. The cars themselves are fantastic. Tesla’s hardware and software are unmatched in many ways, which is why I continue to drive them and plan to buy another. But their customer service and corporate practices leave much to be desired. It’s frustrating to see a company that leads the charge in technological innovation fall so short in how they treat their customers. We’re left feeling like we’re being taken advantage of, not because the technology isn’t good, but because the company prioritizes profit over loyalty and fairness.   For me, this all boils down to a single point: FSD should be portable. It’s a simple and reasonable ask for something as advanced and expensive as Full Self-Driving. It should be tied to the person driving, not the car they happen to be in. We’re buying into a futuristic vision, and Tesla should treat its customers like we’re part of that vision, not just dollar signs.   This was adopted from a comment, a Tesla owner, named Brian, wrote under our previous story, titled: "" Tesla Cuts FSD Prices to as Low as $4,500 – Owners Who Paid $15,000 Demand a Refund .""   So, Tesla FSD owners, are you with Brian? Did you buy in early with promises that never came true? Do you think FSD should be portable? Let's hear your stories in the comments!

Last Updated on:  22nd September 2024, 02:05 am    Yesterday, when I wrote  an article  explaining what I think has happened with Elon Musk and Tesla in recent years that has led to the conundrum Tesla is in right now, or at least its latest “bet the company” move, I knew the reader comments would be great. As some readers have said, the discussions under articles are often better than the articles themselves. There were a lot of great comments under that article, but one stood out to me as an excellent one that deserved its own feature story, and then another one was a perfect followup along similar lines. So, I’m including both of these below. Lastly, I’m going to include a couple of segments from a new book about Musk, which relate to both of these comments.   For those of you who are tired of this topic, apologies, but no need to read further if you are. I do think it’s important stuff to consider and discuss, though, because Tesla is still one of the most important and influential companies in the EV world, and thus the world at large. What happens with Tesla may not be as important today as it was a decade ago, but it’s still extremely important.     Here’s the first comment, from “ Jec ,” that I thought deserved extra attention:   “I’ve worked in Executive Search for many years and happened to serve a larger number of entrepreneurs. They are an interesting lot. They love discussing and working with new ideas and visions. The have a strong drive to Force their idea to success. They are always ‘in the future’. Hate being forced to deal with the past or with minor problems. Always on to new revolutionary ideas, which gives them energy. Remember Musk and boneheaded questions? Instead of listening to Musk and his visions for the future, the analysts wanted information about the past quarter. Musk hated that.   “EVs have now developed to a state where the technology has matured, and there is no room for technological revolutions of the sort that gives energy to Musk. Now it’s a matter of optimizing and perfectionizing, which bores Musk. It’s ‘a game of pennies’.   “That’s why he cuts down on vehicle development, and moves to FSD, which could be a revolution and therefore interests Musk much more. Time has therefore come to leave the daily leadership to a person who enjoys optimizing business and let Elon move on.   “Else, his restlessness combined with his dominant behavior will increasingly become a liability for Tesla.   “In my experience, all entrepreneurs sooner or later hit a glass ceiling and can’t grow the company further, as their negative sides now equalizes their positive sides.”   I think that is mostly backing up what I wrote in part of my article, but expounding on it and explaining it even better. However, I do think that while many people agree with  Jec  that Musk needs to move on, there are also many people (especially TSLA shareholders) who think he needs to keep running Tesla in order to keep it revolutionary. They don’t want Tesla to be “just another car company” and strongly believe in Musk’s robotaxi, AI, and robotics plans.   Though, personally, I think more people would probably be wise to guard against the notion that “because someone succeeded before, they will succeed again in this other way.” Maybe Musk will be right on Tesla AI, robotaxis, and robotics. Or maybe, as he’s been wrong (or at least delayed) for the past several years, he’ll continue to miss targets on these things and burn money indefinitely without the expected return. I think everyone, pro and con on this, has to recognize that we don’t really know where these things will go — including Musk.   But, yes, what does seem clear is that Musk isn’t in it for incremental improvements and the normal running of a large corporation.   Here’s the second reader comment I wanted to highlight here, from  Mike Sarcione :   “Successful entrepreneurs with the biggest egos fall really hard when they are either told they’re wrong, or even worse, ignored by others in authority. One authority to ignore him, current POTUS. His Administration ignored the “king” of global EVs, at the time, in crafting the IRA and EV aspects. Another authority to ignore him was the previous POTUS currently running again. However, Elon Musk saw an opening as that one would change his view of folks who would bend the knee and send lots of $. There was a potential for market uptick if he could get the bully’s followers to soften and accept EVs. Folks with big egos, lots of $, and media control have plenty of vent options for espousing their ‘way of thinking.’ Family isn’t first, his businesses aren’t first, his ego is first, and anyone who tries to hurt it, or help guide it with the best of intentions, fuels its misguided responses which ultimately requires corrections and self rationalization. In business, it’s what have you done for the shareholders lately that will ultimately decide his future. He needs an intellectual miracle. We’ll see whether the one he’s been banking on pans out. Eventually all emperors and empires get defeated, especially when they have divided interests. Between Chinese competition, personal family pressures, political fallout and intellectual failures, their are plenty of divided interests.”   This comment was not in response to that other one above, but it carries on from it. As that other commenter referred to it, entrepreneurs have a tendency toward “dominant behavior.” When they can’t be the dominant figure in the room, or in the story, they can have inflamed reactions. I think anyone who’s following on could see this is a big part of what happened with Musk and Biden. Biden didn’t acknowledge Elon in the way Elon felt he should be acknowledged and consulted. Similar to how Donald Trump ran for president after  Obama made some jokes about him  at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, I think a big part of what got Musk into politics was the way Biden was ignoring him — not just at that infamous EV event, but Biden also reportedly ignored requests for meetings with Musk, or something like that. However, if this is true, one concerning thing here is how Musk can fall into traps, side tangents, and conspiracy theories just from not getting the praise and attention he thinks he deserves. Funny enough, as I’m writing this, I just remembered something I read earlier today:     That’s pretty wild if true, and the sad thing is, it’s probably true. (Side note: I guess this is a benefit of being King of the Global Town Hall.)   In that second reader comment, I loved that line “Eventually all emperors and empires get defeated, especially when they have divided interests.” And as he noted “Between Chinese competition, personal family pressures, political fallout and intellectual failures, their are plenty of divided interests.” Indeed. Though, while many  Tesla  fans would now like to see Musk step down from his role as CEO, I think another anecdote from that new book,  Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter , shows us that he won’t. He has said many times that he’d be happy to pass on the role of CEO, but there’s no one better to do the job. This is how he sees it. A more stark example of how he seems himself as the necessary leader of everything he gets involved in, as summarized by  Rolling Stone , here’s the story of Musk promising the step down from running Twitter if the people thought he should, and then not doing so:   “Following a series of disastrous policy changes, Musk decided to hold an informal performance review for himself using one of his favorite Twitter tools: the polling feature. ‘Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll,’ he tweeted in December 2022 before embarking on a flight from Qatar to London. When he landed, he found that ‘57.5 percent of the more than 17.5 million accounts that had voted were calling for him to resign.’ Between this rejection and the plummeting value of Tesla stock, Musk became withdrawn and unresponsive, with those who did manage to talk to him worrying that he was ‘in the throes of a manic event.’ Speaking with one confidante, ‘Musk choked up and began to doubt his ability to run the company’ in light of the poll results, saying, ‘I’m never going to recover from this.’ He would, of course, go on to hire  Linda Yaccarino  as a replacement CEO in the new year — though as anyone still active on the site that soon became X will tell you, it continues to reflect his worst impulses and warped worldview.”   Musk doesn’t want to give up control of Tesla. Like with Twitter, he believes that he’s the chosen one who is the best person to run the company. Though, whereas this Twitter poll told Musk what he didn’t want to hear and thought he wouldn’t hear, in the case of Tesla, shareholders just recently revived his massive compensation package and basically gave him a full stamp of approval to keep running Tesla however he sees fit. So, even if he’s bored with the day-to-day of Tesla and the incremental needs of a corporation like Tesla, I think he’ll continue to assume he’s the only one who can do the CEO job and will remain just where he is.

The Wall Street Journal wrote  that under a proposed agreement described to investors, Tesla would use xAI models in its driver-assistance software (known as Full Self-Driving or FSD). The AI startup would also help develop features such as a voice assistant in Tesla vehicles and software for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus.   Writing on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter),  Musk said  he hadn’t read the WSJ story, but he described a post summarizing the report as “not accurate.”   “Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI,” he wrote. “The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in compressed form, most of human knowledge, and couldn’t possibly run on the Tesla vehicle inference computer, nor would we want them to.”   Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI (which he co-founded but eventually left).  TechCrunch reported earlier this year  that as part of the pitch for  xAI’s $6 billion funding round , the startup outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies (Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink and X), and its models could then improve technology across those companies.   Tesla shareholders have sued Musk  over the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing company."

I won't pretend the Model S isn't the most important car of the 21st century because it just is, but Musk and the Cybertruck are hot garbage. The great thing about Jalopnik, though, is that we've never pretended to be objective. We share our personal opinions and admit we have biases. Consumer Reports, on the other hand, works to be as unbiased as possible.  So what do they think of the Cybertruck ?   So far, Consumer Reports' testers haven't had time to put the Cybertruck through its full battery of more than 50 tests, but the truck it ordered back in December 2019 has finally arrived carrying a price of $102,000, and the staff have been familiarizing themselves with the Cybertruck enough to have a number of initial impressions after 2,000 miles behind the wheel. And they go beyond the obvious flaws such as bad visibility, distracting controls and a body that's hard to clean or keep clean.   Since the truck arrived, they've found several things they like, including how it hides its size both on the highway and on twisty roads, its acceleration and braking, the forward visibility, bed storage, motorized tonneau cover and comfortable seats.   That said, they've also noticed a few downsides, such as ""everything else about visibility,"" the way the steering combines with the bad visibility to make the truck difficult to maneuver, how unpredictably variable the steering is and the terrible camera situation. Consumer Reports' testers also dislike the giant, floppy windshield wiper, the weird motor noise they experience between 30 and 40 mph, all the limitations on washing it, how badly it absorbs jolts from potholes or highway expansion joints, the missing features, the delivery experience and the amount of attention it gets.   Because it's a Tesla, it also has issues you deal with in other Teslas, such as the steering yoke, almost all the controls being buried in the infotainment screen and the lack of traditional turn signal stalks and door handles. Also, because it's a Tesla, they've already had several issues. In fact, it arrived showing an error code for steering alignment that the Delivery Center insisted wouldn't impact performance. Regenerative braking, which you aren't supposed to be able to turn off, randomly stopped working on one trip. The windshield wiper occasionally starts wiping even when it's not raining.   And while it's not an issue with the truck itself, the Delivery Center sent Consumer Reports onto the lot to find its own Cybertruck, and when they eventually located it, it needed to be charged, washed and given a software update.   We're looking forward to the final results of Consumer Reports' long-term test, but for now, this preview will have to do. And if it's after 3:00 p.m. when you're reading this, you can also check out the video below.   VIDEO"

Cyberbullying: Tesla Cybertruck Owners Are Sick Of Getting The Middle Finger - The Autopian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxNZDl2MTNxN0FHbk0zYXh6WlVZRXN4SUYzaFZtTzYxYnNXZFRYT0ZTbHRkTTg4QWE1bjJHWldtVG1BSlU0UGZCc2hsYklFQkhjNnhqVENFV2tmbFlFc3UtUG9yNVZZVjJkOHRZMlc2aHYyX0lwdXhwUmN0MEczOWVrd3pqSFE3QUJ2ZU9ERUd2OUV4NEdKXzlzanFnUjdNdlRLaUxIZ3MwNA?oc=5,"Mon, 23 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","The  Tesla Cybertruck  was controversial long before it ever hit the streets. Some of that was down to the long delays ahead of production beginning, some of it was down to design, and many lay blame at the feet of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Indeed, we’ve discussed previously that  it’s virtually pointless to review the Cybertruck  since so much public opinion is based on the wacky antics and politics of the company’s enigmatic founder. In any case, now the vehicle is out in the real world, Cybertruck owners have been discovering their trucks are drawing a certain level of attention. Would you believe it’s not all friendly?   If you bought a  new Corolla , or even  a new Mustang , you might expect a raised eyebrow or a knowing nod from a few of your colleagues. The rest of the world would not blink as you passed by. That doesn’t appear to be the case with the Cybertruck, though. No surprise, given it looks like nothing else on the road, but still—some of the stories from the community are surprising to say the least.     Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   Drive one of these polarizing trucks, and you can apparently expect harsh words and middle fingers just about wherever you go. It might be made out of stainless steel, but the Cybertruck is a magnet for the haters — whether haters of EVs or haters of Elon Musk.   The Cybertruck was an instant laughing stock when its bulletproof windows famously shattered at Tesla’s big announcement event. In some sectors, it apparently still is.   Big Metal Thing   You might cast your mind back to David Tracy’s Cybertruck review  from June this year . Most notably, he received a charming unsolicited comment from the sidewalk. “Your truck is ugly!” went the cry.   So when David saw Cybertruck owner Don Turner post on an owner’s page how tough it’s been for him to deal with insults, we figured we’d look into it a bit. It turns out, it’s not just David Tracy getting harsh word on the streets of LA. Many Cybertruck owners deal with it regularly.   David found that at least one person in LA really didn’t like the design. Credit: David Tracy I chatted to members of the  Tesla Cybertruck Owners  group on Facebook, and heard from Floridian owner Marcus Story. “I’m a day-one reservation holder for the Cybertruck with a low VIN,” he says. “As an early adopter of Tesla vehicles, I’ve experienced firsthand what it’s like to own an EV in a southern car-loving town, and it has certainly been interesting!”   “Politics and election seasons play a significant role in people’s perceptions—many instantly assume you vote a certain way just because you drive a Tesla,” Marcus explains. “I’ve encountered plenty of false information, blatant lies, and fear-driven propaganda, like claims that the truck will catch fire in a car wash, that the battery will die after two years, or that it’s worse for the environment.”   When a vehicle looks this different, it’s always going to draw some eyes. But should it draw rude hand gestures? That’s another matter entirely. Credit: David Tracy   He’s had some darker experiences, too. “I’ve received late-night hate messages and threats, been flipped off, ‘coal-rolled,’ and had people deliberately slow down in front of me,” he says. “But I’m not a pushover, and I confront this behavior directly.” Ultimately, he usually knows where it’s coming from. “I know a lot of people in my town, and it’s easy to trace their comments back to some of the points I mentioned earlier,” he explains. “I’m vocal and quick to counter with facts and logic, which helps shut down any nonsense.”   Others tell similar stories. Gary Lopez of California told me that while kids are usually very into the spaceship-looking vehicle, adults have been profoundly negative. “Kids that see the truck absolutely lose it with excitement… then there are grown adults who throw tantrums at you for whatever reason,” he says. “Although negative reactions are ten percent of reactions, I had a range of thumbs down all the way to ‘go k** yourself.'” One suspects Gary missed an asterisk there, but I’ll present the quote as he wrote it. He notes that this is all happens out on the road while driving. “No one says anything to my face,” says Gary.   Say what you will about the quality of the truck, the company, or the people who made it. It’s hard to think of too many other cars that get such vile attention. One is perhaps reminded of the way Prius owners were once treated by die-hard pollution fans, or the kind of gendered insults so often levelled at the  Miata community .   People will probably be nice to you if they need to cop a charge. Also, hat tip to Tesla for putting out some fresh Cybertruck press pics. Really, it helps!   Meanwhile, over in Ohio, Ryan Fry says he’s seen a bit of both. “I would say it’s eighty percent positive and twenty percent negative…but the negative is really negative,” he told me. Tina Cyr agreed. “The haters are with a capital H,” she says. “Someone yelled out on a crowded street, ‘That is so ugly!'” Much the same as happened to our own David Tracy. “I wanted to shout back ‘LIKE YOUR MAMA!’ but I didn’t,” she laughs.   The Bird is usually reserved for people that can’t merge or jerks that steal your parking space. Now, though, it seems to be intimately associated with the Cybertruck based on the endless posts from owners on Facebook. “Got my first middle finger today,” said Josh Olberding on a Cybertruck owners page. “The driver that flipped me off had a Kia Soul with its bumper missing… I smiled and waved, maybe they just need some love?” Others find the attention is particularly upsetting for their family. “It’s really annoying when people give us the middle finger and our kids are in the car, or they keep pointing at our Cybertruck and then keep giving us a thumbs down,” says Sadaf Saleh. For some, these instances of negative are remarkably frequent, too. “We’ve gotten like six flip-offs and some people yelling at us,” said Ashley Sarpolis. “We’ve only had it four days, lol.”   Posts like this abound wherever Cybertruck owners congregate.   Others have seen hate escalate to violence. Washington D.C. owner Rico Clark noted he’d had a glass bottle thrown at his vehicle. Perhaps one of the uglier responses seems to come from the diesel set, too. Numerous members of the Tesla Cybertruck Owners group reported people “rolling coal” on them, wherein a diesel truck dumps a large plume of black exhaust smoke on other cars. It’s not just offensive,  it’s also illegal  as per the EPA, and pretty terrible for your lungs.   As for why it happens? You could surmise that it’s people attacking something that’s different, or tearing down what some see as an ostentatious display of wealth. However, for owner Hollie Holcombe, the cause is largely down to one big personality. “Living in a place with so many progressive people around, I get a lot of hate,” she says. “I am also progressive, but some of my friends in this area don’t agree that Tesla is a good company.” A lot of it comes down to the Tesla CEO in her eyes. “They see Elon as evil,” she says. “They’re upset about the cobalt issue, which they either don’t understand or don’t believe it when Elon says they’re reducing it… I’m not sure what else they’re upset about.”   VIDEO   This owner captured a BMW driver trying to throw a bottle at their car. Odd behavior.   Negative perceptions around the truck’s design have come up, too. “My child’s best friend is not allowed to ride in the Cybertruck because they think it doesn’t have crumple zones,” she explains. The one benefit? She’s noticed that she’s getting  less  hassle from diesel drivers now than before. “Coal rollers were only an issue for me when I was driving the Model S,” she says. “They now somehow think I’m on their side because I drive a truck.”       While plenty of owners report receiving rude comments or gestures, others have seen altogether worse conduct from members of the public.   Don Turner   Hi, it’s David Tracy. I had a chance to talk with Don Turner — the LA-based Tesla owner who works in the senior care industry and whose Facebook post inspired this article — after Lewin finished writing this piece, and I figured I’d add some notes about our chat. Turner’s post was about the mistreatment he’s received as a Tesla Cybertruck owner (that’s his truck below; he’s very proud of it).     He says there are a number of factors that make the Cybertruck a target for hate: It’s the truck’s value, it’s the fact that it’s electric, it’s the fact that it looks the way it does, and it’s Elon.   “No matter what area [I’m driving in] — it can be a very affluent area — they throw their thumbs down,” he told me over the phone while doing his daily morning walk. “Very few people say they like the truck because of Elon Musk; nobody really claims to like the guy,” Turner told me before making his thoughts on Musk clear.   “Elon Musk… that jackass — I like his technology, I like his truck — ….he doesn’t shut his freakin’ mouth. He’s a bigmouth turkey. He’s probably going to do something stupid before the election. I just don’t like Elon Musk. If he sticks to the technology and building companies, there’s no one smarter.”   “Once he gets into the political stuff, it really ruins his brand, it ruins the Tesla brand,” he told me, saying loads of folks dislike his truck specifically because of the controversial CEO.     “Thumbs up, thumbs down, middle finger — that’s normal,” he says of his experience driving his stainless steel pickup.       He says there’s definitely a class element to the hate. “I’ve had people pull up to me in beaters and they’re thumbs down,” he says. “One guy came up to me and said ‘That truck is ugly!'”       “It doesn’t feel different to me because I’ve been getting it my whole life. I’ve always had nice vehicles,” he told me, noting he used to ride a sweet high-end motorcycle. “It’s always ‘how can you afford this’?       Turner"

Tesla Plaid Models Performance: 0-60 MPH And Top Speed - Top Speed,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBIQmIzWl9DNmgwTmJZbmdaNUV1OFg4WWtTREZld1M1VHQ1ckh5QWFTc281OGcydzhEUUFRVHMzOWp4S09rdEpsZkZ2c2stN2phaVFMMXRTMV9iaEtMb2pSMHBqN3dDeVk?oc=5,"Mon, 23 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla  introduced the                 Plaid moniker in 2021  , as an all-new flagship performance derivative, boasting outstanding acceleration and top speed capabilities with the added benefit of them being marginally less expensive than the P100D predecessors. The  electric vehicle  industry reveres the Plaid trim and often uses it as a benchmark to measure how capable electric cars are competing as the electrification gold rush persists in the global automotive market. Tesla remains one of the most competitive EV brands in the world. The Plaids may not be its best-selling cars, but they certainly play a significant role in the brand's overall consistent success rate.        Flagship performance vehicles typically aren't the most profitable, but they generate a strong brand sentiment, especially if they                 benefit from being the fastest car option out there  . Tesla's Plaid twins are a perfect example of this, as they act as highly aspirational examples that motivate more potential consumers to buy into the brand. This is just another layer that contributes to market success, alongside competitive pricing, fast production turnaround times, a reliable brand reputation, and other factors. Looking beyond this, Tesla's Plaid option is one of the more special and exhilarating electric car options in its very concentrated catalog, which is a factor that's unlikely to change for quite some time.             In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including the EPA and MotorTrend.               Related     Tesla's premier performance model outperforms these 10 substantially more expensive supercar rivals.                                    Tesla's World-Class Triple-Motor Plaid Configuration                   Tesla applies an innovative triple electric motor system to the Model S and Model X Plaid's drivetrain, with a focus on efficiency, high performance, and a balanced power distribution. The system consists of two motors on the rear axle and one on the front, allowing for precise torque vectoring, improving handling and cornering stability.   One of the key innovations is the use of carbon-sleeved rotors in the rear motors. Carbon wrapping enables the rotors to spin at incredibly high speeds without expanding due to centrifugal forces, maintaining structural integrity and increasing motor performance. This design reduces thermal expansion, which is a significant improvement over traditional metals like steel or aluminum. Tesla also optimized the stator's design, focusing on tighter windings and better heat dissipation, which enhances efficiency.

Key Features Of The Plaid's Triple Electric Motors                                                   The Tesla Plaid's electric motors feature carbon-sleeved rotors, allowing them to spin at extremely high RPMs without structural expansion.                                                                     Tesla uses a tri-motor setup, with two rear motors for independent torque vectoring and enhanced handling precision.                                                                     The motors have tighter stator windings, improving efficiency by reducing electrical losses and enhancing heat dissipation.                                                                     High-strength permanent magnets inside the motors boost power density and responsiveness while minimizing energy consumption.                                                                     Advanced cooling systems in the motors ensure consistent thermal management, enabling sustained high-performance driving without overheating.                                                                     Tesla's use of lightweight materials in motor construction reduces overall mass, improving acceleration and driving dynamics without sacrificing durability.                              The materials used are lightweight yet durable, with aluminum and high-strength steel providing a balance between weight savings and structural rigidity. The battery pack, integrated into the vehicle’s floor, uses advanced cells with improved thermal management to maintain consistent performance during high-power output situations. A new cooling architecture ensures that heat is efficiently dispersed, allowing the battery to sustain high speeds and prolonged performance without overheating.    Tesla employs a                lithium-ion chemistry  for the battery, optimizing it for energy density and longevity. It built this battery pack alongside Panasonic, which has been its official battery partner since its early Roadster days. The overall mechanical design leverages lightweight materials, superior heat management, and cutting-edge innovations like carbon-sleeved rotors to deliver a highly efficient and durable propulsion system.             Related     The Tesla Model S Plaid is the world's quickest production cars while being as practical as the next-door full-size sedan.                                     Tesla Model X Plaid And Model S Plaid Specifications                                       Bring-a-Trailer          Both the Tesla Model S Plaid and Model X Plaid feature identical drivetrains, producing 1,020 horsepower and 1,050 pound-feet of torque to all four wheels, but there are considerable performance differences between the sedan and its SUV counterpart.   Being a larger option with a heavier 5,248-pound curb weight figure, this derivative accelerates from 0-60 MPH in an impressive 2.5 seconds from a standing start and hits a limited 149 MPH top speed. This is an incredible set of figures for a vehicle that can seat seven people with relatively high comfort levels. It features a 98 kWh Panasonic-designed lithium-ion battery pack that  carries it for an EPA-estimated 326 miles  and returns 34 kWh per 100 miles on the combined cycle.

Weighing in at just 4,766 pounds, Tesla claims you'll be able to enjoy 0-60 MPH acceleration speeds as fast as 1.99 seconds with a one-foot rollout subtracted. It will also  reach a staggeringly high 200 MPH limited top speed  and cover a quarter-mile in 9.4 seconds at 151 MPH.   Independent tests indicate that you can easily expect the  Model S Plaid to hit 0-60 MPH in 2.1 seconds  from a standing start in real-world conditions. Using the same battery as the Model X, the EPA estimates the Plaid will cover 396 miles on a single charge and return a 31 kWh per 100 miles energy consumption figure.

How Fast Tesla Plaid Models Are                                       Bring-a-Trailer           We all know that the Tesla Plaid models are more than                 fast enough in a straight line  , but the true test of speed is conducted on the racetrack. Many reviewers have subjected the Model S and X Plaids to extensive track testing, with some very impressive and commendable results. The most noteworthy of the lot is the Model S's Nürburgring lap time of 7 minutes and 25.23 seconds, conducted by the brand itself. It also achieved a 23.20-second result on MotorTrend's figure eight course, a 1 minute and 20.03 second result at Willow Springs, and 1 minute 26.75 seconds at Laguna Seca.       Based on these times, we can ascertain that the Model S Plaid is faster than the McLaren 765LT, SRT Viper GTS, Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S, and Porsche 911 GT2 RS, which are some formidable high performance car options. Interestingly, no one has subjected the Model X Plaid to any track testing, but independent reviewers have confirmed that it will cover a 0-60 MPH sprint in 2.7 seconds, 0 to 100 MPH in 5.1 seconds, and 0 to 150 MPH in 10.4 seconds. You can also expect it to cover a quarter mile in 9.6 seconds at 147 MPH.       Tesla's Model S and X Plaid feature significant suspension upgrades to handle their high-performance capabilities and increased weight capacities. Both models feature an advanced adaptive air suspension system that constantly adjusts damping to suit driving conditions, providing a balance between comfort and performance. The system monitors factors like vehicle speed, steering angle, and road surface, making real-time adjustments to improve handling and ride quality. The suspension's software-driven controls enhance cornering stability and minimize body roll, especially at high speeds. Tesla has also upgraded the suspension geometry with improved bushings and bearings, enhancing durability and steering precision. Additionally, the Plaid models can lower the ride height automatically at higher speeds to improve aerodynamics and stability, while raising it for "

You Can Now Get Tesla Model 3 with $0 Due at Delivery - CleanTechnica,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNZHNjekxjcEw5OE9wRzRUSzFuRmhxQkM3b0U3NUJBRURSTXp5M0pZa3k1UzVmQmJ0MnZTdHhHZnM1MmRIVmpOeFh0aXZtZWJFMFNzSlZxTjg4RE11Zm1SdmlReVNSZENmNWJQX1ZaLVRBazRIVC1JZUJicl9CeDVBNjhYNXBCNFdodkRmbVZEZU9yNjFU0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBJMnh3c2pob3hVdlpZYWN1TmlNT2NHQlZXc1prWDVsb2RPZW0wS2JTRWpVcHNzMHpJSHJlX2FqXzFPeXE5YjFVUHVwVVJWRVJId013aTZjbU9rVU9TYUNUa3hPcHVDWHpSTEZxdW9WUUpfSjh4dUY5U1RWT014eDR5M3JSbW83RHgzWHpKV3Rld1hKRWhJZFZFTUE?oc=5,"Fri, 13 Sep 2024 21:18:00 GMT","Sign up for  CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries , sign up for  our daily newsletter , and/or  follow us on Google News !       In another effort to pull in new buyers, Tesla has just sent out a new offer. You can now buy a brand new Tesla Model 3 — with all of its recent upgrades — and pay $0 at delivery. (Of course, you still have to pay for the car eventually, but not having to put any money down can help out many buyers.)   Furthermore, if you take delivery by September 30, along with this $0 due on delivery, you can get financing for as low as 2.49% APR. (The federal interest rate is currently 5.50%, so that means Tesla is subsidizing the interest rate for you.) Note that these opportunities are available if you apply the federal tax credit for EVs at the point of sale.   There’s another option if you don’t mind putting some money down in order to get an  even lower  interest rate. If you put 20% down, you can get a 1.99% APR.   Both of these low-interest-rate offers are for loans up to 60 months in length.   Here’s a screenshot of the brief email Tesla just sent along:     You can also get $1,000 of using a Tesla owner’s referral code. If you’re in need of such a code, you’re free to use mine:  https://ts.la/zachary63404   Just go ahead and start your order there, and on the second step you’ll see the various finance, lease, or cash purchase options.   Yes, I do recommend the white interior! Especially if you live in a hot climate. It’s the #1 recommendation I’d make above every other. Image courtesy of Tesla.   Stepping back and looking more broadly at the Tesla story, this new offer, including the September 30 deadline, imply to me that Tesla doesn’t naturally have enough consumer demand to move all of the vehicles it wants to move in the United States. It keeps coming up with new incentives, like this brand new $0 down one, in order stimulate more sales. If the company naturally had consumer demand for all the vehicles it can produce, we wouldn’t be seeing artificially low APR options, $0 down options, or even the revived referral bonuses.   That doesn’t mean Tesla is facing a consumer demand or sales crisis. Perhaps these mild incentives will result in Tesla selling all the vehicles it could produce in the 3rd quarter in the United States. Perhaps. We’ll see soon what Tesla is able to achieve this quarter.   One positive thing I’d note here is that Tesla didn’t resort to this new incentive until late in the quarter, just a couple of weeks before the quarter ends. That implies that it wasn’t facing a severe consumer demand challenge earlier in the quarter. Also, unless I’m mistaken, a $0 down option isn’t the most dramatic or challenging for the company. It may pull in many more buyers (maybe), but I don’t think it’ll cost Tesla much.   What are your thoughts on the new $0-down Tesla pitch? And will you or anyone you know now make the final decision to buy a Tesla thanks to this new offer?

US firefighters used some 190,000 liters of water to extinguish a blaze involving an electric Tesla Semi truck this month following a crash, a government agency said.   Besides water to cool the vehicle's batteries, California firefighters also ""used an aircraft to apply fire retardant to the immediate area as a precautionary measure,"" said the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in a statement released Thursday.   The crash involving the Tesla Semi took place in the wee hours of August 19 as the vehicle was traveling near Emigrant Gap in California, the NTSB said.   The semi-truck operated by a Tesla employee was headed from Livermore, California, to a Tesla facility in Sparks, Nevada.   The vehicle veered off the road while navigating a curve and struck a tree, before going down a slope to rest against several trees, the report added.   The driver was not injured.   But ""the vehicle's lithium-ion electric battery system ignited after the roadway departure, resulting in a postcrash fire,"" said the NTSB.   It took about 50,000 gallons of water—nearly 190,000 liters—to extinguish the flames and cool the vehicle's batteries, the agency said.   California firefighters also mobilized an aircraft to drop retardant around the  crash site .   California suffers from numerous forest fires every summer, which are destructive and sometimes fatal.   The  freeway  was closed for around 15 hours so firefighters could ensure the batteries were ""at a safe temperature for vehicle recovery operations,"" said the NTSB.   This was also to prevent the spread of the fire to surrounding forested areas.   When Tesla announced its second quarter results recently, chief executive Elon Musk indicated that large-scale production of Semis was still planned to start by end-2025.   The first such vehicles have been delivered to a few selected customers such as PepsiCo since 2022.                                                    © 2024 AFP                                                    Citation :                                                 Tesla truck fire took 190,000 liters of water to extinguish (2024, September 14)                                                 retrieved 23 April 2025                                                 from https://techxplore.com/news/2024-09-tesla-truck-liters-extinguish.html                                                                                             This document is subject to copyright.

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

I unhooked the car charger, stowed my luggage in the trunk and put my computer bag in the frunk. Recognizing the key card in my wallet, the car unlocked automatically, then silently turned on when I depressed the brake pedal. Before backing out of the garage, I checked the details on the latest, overnight software update. In the five years since I bought my Model 3, Tesla Inc. has remade the auto landscape. And for nearly 5 million owners worldwide, it has introduced a different car-owning experience, from its pioneering electronics to its battery-powered operation. This is my five-year anniversary report on living with an EV. As The Detroit News auto critic, I test more than 100 cars a year. The Model 3 has maintained its freshness, pushing the envelope in over-the-air updates, dealer service and autonomous driving. I’ve tracked it, road-tripped it, Dream-Cruised it and loaned it to Car and Driver for an EV comparison test. It’s exposed the limitations of battery power compared to internal combustion engine cars, which remain the U.S. consumer market’s choice of personal transportation. And it’s introduced me to a Tesla universe of owners as passionate as any Porsche and Mustang club. Owners like ex-General Motors engineer Dick Amacher, 76, of Rochester Hills, who adopted his Model 3 in 2019, and Belleville’s Kelli Sloan, 60, whose 2018 Model 3 has weathered 126,000 miles over six years. “I named her Stella. She’s a black, rear-wheel-drive, long-range model,” said Sloan, who together with husband Burt, has added a 2020 Model Y and 2024 Cybertruck to their fleet. “Everything in our house is now electric, even the lawnmower. I’ve driven the Model 3 all over, including to Park City, Utah, and twice to the (Florida) Keys.” I bought my first, rear-wheel-drive, 271-horsepower, $58,450 Model 3 in fall 2018, then traded it for an all-wheel-drive, 473-horsepower, $63,940 Model 3 Performance model a year later when Tesla temporarily dropped the price by $15k. As readers of this space know, I have a need for speed. My first year with the handsome, RWD Model 3 was fascinating, and M3P extended my electric journey while interfacing with the first viable startup automaker in decades. From its “production Hell” while Tesla struggled to meet a flood of 250,000 orders, Model 3 has stabilized as the No. 12 best-selling vehicle in the U.S. marketplace ahead of stalwarts like the Toyota Corolla and Chevy Equinox. Its sibling Model Y reigns as the No. 4 best-seller and No. 1 selling luxury vehicle. It has inspired countless tech innovations, from its 15.4-inch touchscreen to the “frunk” (front trunk) to driver-assistance tech. It’s even been a political lightning rod with Tesla CEO Elon Musk swinging from being the scourge of the Right (after taking a $465 million taxpayer loan from the Obama administration) to the bane of the Left (when he restored former President Donald Trump’s Twitter account). Once a rare sight around Metro Detroit, my Model 3 has been joined by hundreds more — including its sibling Model Y. Fortunately for Michigan owners, the new Whitmer administration in January 2020 overturned Gov. Rick Snyder’s state ban (more politics!) on Tesla service centers. Service Tesla’s first in-state service center opened on Dixie Highway just west of downtown Clarkston in May 2020. A half-hour drive from my house, it’s been my primary maintenance facility for the last five years. Prior to that, I had to go back to Cleveland (where I bought my Teslas) to get service. Not that there isn't much service to do on an electric vehicle. In five years, I’ve had seven service calls with the Model 3 Performance, two of them mobile house calls. The first issue, in early 2021, stemmed from a rodent’s nest that had been built in my console during the winter. Removing it required three visits (two to the service center, one from Mobile Unit. Yes, Tesla makes house calls). Critters like warm batteries, apparently. I noticed the invasion because I could hear acorns rolling around beneath the cabin. Service appointments are activated by the Tesla app. I submit the issue and a dispatcher determines whether it can be resolved 1) over the air, 2) via Mobile Unit visit, or 3) a journey to the service center. On July 7, 2022, I experienced an Autopilot sensor issue, which a tech corrected remotely. And I scheduled two Bluetooth services when my phone failed to connect. The remaining visit? At 10,000 miles for scheduled maintenance and to replace the trunk-lid wiring harness under recall. Cost? Just $166 to rotate tires and check brake pads, brake fluid, windshield washer fluid and battery coolant. Amacher bought his blue, RWD Model 3 Long Range (nickname: Deja Blue) in April 2019 and has logged 36,000 miles, including a trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia. I asked if he was tempted to upgrade to a 2024 Highland, the second-generation Model 3 introduced earlier this year with a quieter cabin, yoke steering, predictive gear changes and revised styling. “I’m not tempted,” said Amacher, whose car has been trouble-free. “I’ve had no battery degradation, no brake pad changes, no oil jobs.” Charging Most of my EV driving is local. I am constantly on airplanes, work remotely, and don’t have a regular office commute. Combined with testing other vehicles, that keeps mileage on my Tesla low. I plug in the M3P in my garage at night. At a cost of 15 cents/per kWh, the Tesla is significantly cheaper to fuel than a comparable gas car (say, the 19 mpg BMW M2 that I had my eyes on before Musk introduced the Model 3 in 2016). To preserve battery life, I charge to 80% of capacity — 237 miles — for a cost of $16. At $4.60 for premium petrol in the Bimmer, my cost would be $57 per tank-full. Take the Model 3 on the road and that advantage drops. Tesla Superchargers cost 39 cents/per kWh for a total of $31 over 237 miles. Assume, conservatively, that I charge 50/50 at home/Superchargers, and I’ve paid $1,170 in charging fees over my 13,000 miles of ownership — $2,000 in savings over an equivalent gas-powered performance sedan. That’s enough to pay for one of the two, 240-volt, $2,000 charging stations (charger plus installation cost) I’ve put in my Oakland County home and Charlevoix summer cabin that Mrs. Payne and I own. Kelli Sloan’s last ICE car was a 2008 Ford Taurus X that drank fuel at 18 mpg. “Between fuel and maintenance costs, I’ve saved a bundle with the Model 3,” she said. Trips Wait, Payne, you’ve paid $4,000 for twin charging stations? If you own an electric car, you want to maximize home charging for affordability (see above) — and because EVs are slower to fill than ICEs. A gas-burner will fill 500 miles of fuel in two minutes. I regularly travel the 250 miles from Oakland County to Charlevoix. Tesla’s navigation system smartly plans the trip, including suggestions for restaurants/stores near chargers. En route to Charlevoix, I make a 25-minute stop at the Bay City Supercharger in a Meijer parking lot to refuel from about 32% to 80% of charge — or about 141 miles of range. If I travel at 75 mph, that should get me to Charlevoix with a cushion of 20% of range. I’ve learned batteries are vulnerable to changing conditions. Unlike ICEs, the consequences of changing conditions can seriously affect EV travel plans due to sparse charging infrastructure and lengthy recharge times. Even different wheel sizes will affect your range. Driving at 80 mph will cut range 30%. Driving in pouring rain will cut it 40%. Drive in 90-degree heat — or sub-30 degrees cold — and lose 25% of range. Facing those variables — and the lack of charging infrastructure up north — I installed a second charger in our cabin. It relieves uncertainty. Battery degradation Battery degradation is an inexact science that depends on how often you use superchargers, where you store your car, and so on. Tesla claims its batteries will retain at least 70% of charge over eight years, but battery-data firm Recurrent studied real-world Tesla driving range and found average battery degradation to 64% of capacity after three years. I put 20-inch wheels on my M3P, which decreased range (according to EPA figures) from 322 miles to 299. My five-year-old car consistently charges to 298 miles at 100% charge. Amacher and Sloan haven’t seen battery degradation in their Model 3s. Competition For good and ill, Tesla has been a pioneer — charting its own path on charging networks, manufacturer-run showrooms, even a proprietary digital infotainment system. It’s a strategy that has developed a rabid, anti-establishment fan base. Think Apple vs. Microsoft. Voice commands work beautifully, but infotainment has fallen short on content. Neither Sirius XM nor digital versions of my favorite AM stations are available, and Tesla also refuses Apple CarPay and Android Auto compatibility. Still, “I would have a hard time switching to another EV brand,” said Amacher, who added to his 2019 Model 3 purchase with a 2020 Model Y Performance and a 2023 Model 3. “Why change to Windows when you have a good Mac?” Charging network The Supercharger network was built from scratch and continues to grow. It’s Tesla’s secret sauce — so much so that other automakers have rushed to give their customers access, beginning with Ford Motor Co. last spring. That access will narrow Tesla’s advantage (while padding profits) as will Google Built-in, a new operating system that runs GM/Honda/Volvo EVs and that is Tesla’s equal in charting trips. Autonomous driving Most notably, the competition has caught up on self-driving. Synonymous with the autonomous revolution, Tesla once promised owners they’d be able to rent their cars as autonomous taxis. Didn’t happen. But my car’s Autopilot system has continuously improved with OTA updates to offer Tesla's Full Self-Driving system today. “My ‘ah-ha moment’ came in 2018 while driving to Park City,” said Sloan. “We were on I-"

The  Tesla Model 3 Highland brings a refreshed design , updated technology, and various improvements that aim to keep it competitive in the rapid and ever-evolving world of electric cars. However, not everything about the Tesla Model 3 Highland refresh is necessarily an improvement. Here are all the key facts to know about the upgraded Model 3.         All key information has been sourced from Tesla directly, unless stated otherwise.

Tesla has given the car a more refined look, with a streamlined front bumper and slimmer headlights that enhance its sleekness. In addition, there are restyled C-shaped taillights. This refresh also brings some improvements to aerodynamics, which are always critical for boosting efficiency and range. With a drag coefficient reduced from an already impressive 0.23 to 0.219, the new design helps the car slice through the air more effectively. Not only does this contribute to the Tesla Model 3 Highland looking sharper on the road, but it also improves its energy efficiency and range. Regarding the Model 3 Performance specifically, Tesla claims 5% less drag and a 36% reduction in lift.                A Variety Of Wheel Designs And Two New Colors        The updated range of wheels is as follows:                                              18-inch Photon wheels (standard on RWD and Long Range AWD models)                                                                     19-inch Nova wheels (optional on RWD and Long Range AWD models)                                                                     20-inch Warp wheels (standard on Performance model)                              Regarding the color palette, Stealth Gray and Ultra Red have been introduced as new options. The former costs nothing extra, but Ultra Red requires another $2,000.         Related     Is the new Model 3 Performance worth the extra cost over the standard Model 3?             2                                 The Interior Displays Have Been Updated                          As before, the interior of the Tesla Model 3 is dominated by a large center touchscreen interface. In the latest Highland model, the 15.4-inch display has been upgraded with slimmer bezels than before. Below this screen are two slots for charging mobile phones wirelessly. Rear passengers aren't forgotten, as they now have access to an eight-inch touchscreen of their own. Using this smaller display, those at the back can manage infotainment and climate settings without bothering the driver.   What won't thrill the connected generation is the continued omission of Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, SiriusXM, or even AM radio, which are functions most people will be accustomed to from other brands. A host of connectivity features are still available for passing the time when waiting for your car to recharge, however. These include:                                              Video streaming                                                                     Caraoke                                                                     Music streaming                                                                     Internet browser                                       	  						Google News 			       Add CarBuzz to your Google News feed.         3                                 Cabin Quality Is Better Than Before                                              Tesla         Tesla has made notable strides in improving the materials and overall fit and finish of the new Model 3 Highland. Early versions of the Model 3 were often criticized for having an interior that didn’t live up to the car’s price tag, but the Highland refresh addresses these concerns. You’ll now find softer materials throughout the cabin, more refined trim details, and a generally higher-quality feel. Wood veneer has made way for an upscale fabric, while the wraparound ambient lighting also creates a more expensive-feeling atmosphere when seated inside. It's not yet a match for BMW or Audi in terms of quality, but at least Tesla is heading in the right direction.     4                                 Conventional Column Stalks Are Gone                                              Tesla         Tesla is known for embracing a minimalist design philosophy, and the new Model 3 pushes this even further. The traditional gear selector stalk is now gone,  replaced by predictive shifting , whereby the car automatically predicts whether you need to be in drive or reverse. It's not always entirely intuitive, so drivers can alternatively select drive or reverse by using the touchscreen or a partially hidden overhead panel. Some might argue that these changes enhance the futuristic vibe, but others will likely miss the physical controls for their simplicity and ease of use. Besides the more complex shifting routine, the latest Model 3 also features touch-sensitive controls on the steering wheel for managing turn signals. It's another change that could frustrate drivers coming from a more conventional car.     5                                 Seating Comfort Has Been Enhanced                          Tesla didn’t just improve the interior’s materials; the Model 3 Highland also offers better seats. Both front and rear passengers now benefit from seats with better cushioning and support, making the car more enjoyable overall. Rear-seat comfort is particularly better, thanks to a new bench seat with a higher front cushion, a more comfortable backrest angle, and improved padding. The Performance model gets its own sporty seat upgrades.   These changes enhance the feeling that the Model 3 refresh is a step up in luxury.         Inside, Model 3 Performance is now equipped with new Sport seats that feature enhanced bolstering and a deeper, more engaging seating position.         6                                 Improved Noise Insulation                                              Tesla         One of the more subtle but significant improvements in the Tesla Model 3 Highland is the quietness of the cabin. Tesla has added more sound insulation, 360-degree acoustic glass, and better body baffles and sealing, making the Model 3 a much quieter ride. This not only enhances the overall driving experience but also makes everything more comfortable. Whether you're commuting or going on a road trip, the newfound serenity inside the cabin is a welcome change for many drivers.     7                                 Class-Leading Performance And Improved Range                                              Tesla                      Impressive Acceleration Across The Lineup        When it comes to performance, the Tesla Model 3 Highland still leads the pack in many ways. Even in its most basic configuration, the rear-wheel-drive Model 3 offers brisk acceleration, going from 0-60 mph in 5.8 seconds. The Long Range and  510-hp Performance variants  shave that time down even further, with the latter hitting 60 mph in a mere 2.9 seconds. The all-wheel-drive system in the higher trims also provides excellent traction and stability, making the Model 3 Highland a joy to drive in all conditions. Add in the instant torque from its electric motors, and you have a car that feels as responsive and exhilarating as ever.

The Long Range RWD leads the way with a 363-mile range, followed by the Long Range AWD's 341 miles. The Performance AWD maxes out at 303 miles, while the cheapest RWD variant gets 272 miles from a full charge.

While the cost of entry into the EV world is still higher than traditional gas-powered vehicles, the Model 3 has proven to be a solid investment for many buyers. It is at the forefront of EV tech, its impressive range, and                 Tesla’s signature minimalist desig  have made it one of the most sought-after electric sedans. But for those not looking to purchase a brand-new Tesla, an  older Model 3  could be the perfect solution.        With Tesla’s over-the-air updates keeping even older models feeling fresh, a used Model 3 retains much of the appeal of its newer counterparts. While many traditional vehicles see steep depreciation, the Model 3 holds its value surprisingly well thanks to its innovative features,  low maintenance costs , and growing demand for electric cars. Whether you're after the sleek design,                 Autopilot  , or simply the thrill of driving an EV, a three-year-old Model 3 offers a unique opportunity to experience Tesla’s excellence without the brand-new price tag.             In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla and other authoritative sources, including KBB, Edmunds, and J.D. Power.               Related     The Tesla Model 3 gets all grown up with a mid-life update courtesy of a new face, more range, and Porsche-bating performance.                                    Here's How Much A 3-Year-Old Tesla Model 3 Is Worth Today                   If you're looking at grabbing one of Tesla's best-selling vehicles, the Model 3, you're likely to find that even a model a few years older is still pretty pricey. These EVs hold their value fairly well, and that is all thanks to the innovative design, features, and stellar performance that comes from the Tesla brand. With Tesla's over-the-air software updates and high demand, the Model 3 depreciates slower than many traditional ICE cars. On average, a 2021 Tesla Model 3 is priced between $26,600 and $33,200, depending on the trim level and condition.   While the depreciation is noticeable, especially for luxury and performance models, the Model 3 holds a strong position in the EV market. The Standard Range Plus trim, which originally retailed for around $39,190, tends to command a resale value of about $26,600. Higher trims like the Performance model, which was originally priced at $56,190, can fetch around $33,200. These prices reflect the enduring appeal of Tesla’s electric sedans, as well as their minimal maintenance costs among the ongoing innovations.                Tesla Model 3 Depreciation Over 3 Years                            Tesla         In terms of depreciation, the Tesla Model 3 follows a pattern similar to other luxury vehicles, but with a slightly more favorable curve. On average, the 2021 Model 3 depreciates by around 20- to 30-percent in its first three years. This is relatively low compared to the 40- to 50-percent decline seen in many gas-powered counterparts. According to the  Edmunds  cost-to-own calculator, depreciation in year three averages $2,594 for the Standard Range Plus, with some slight variation depending on trim and location.

The Tesla Model 3’s strong residual value is a statement in its desirability, particularly among tech-savvy buyers looking for an EV with cutting-edge features like Autopilot and access to the  expansive Supercharger network .                How Much A Tesla Model 3 Might Depreciate Beyond Three Years                            Tesla         Looking beyond the three-year mark, depreciation tends to slow, especially as Tesla continues to offer over-the-air updates that keep older models fresh. You can expect the Model 3 to lose an additional 10- to 15-percent of its value per year after the initial three-year period. By the time a Model 3 reaches five years of age, it will have finally dropped to around 50- to 60-percent of its original value.   Of course, factors like mileage, condition, and advancements in EV technology will influence future resale values. However, with the growing popularity of electric vehicles and Tesla’s solid reputation, the Model 3 is likely to remain competitive in the used car market. Tesla has always been a strong contender, and it still holds good value even for the  decade-old 2014 Model S .

Buying A Model 3 New vs. Used                                       Tesla          Deciding between a new or used Tesla Model 3 depends on your priorities. A new Model 3 offers the                 latest battery technology  , enhanced range, and cutting-edge features. Tesla’s 2024 lineup continues to push boundaries with improvements in range and performance, but you'll be paying a premium—starting at $33,390 for the rear-wheel drive base model.                    2024 Tesla Model 3 RWD Specs                  Powertrain       Single electric motor           Transmission       Single-speed direct drive           Driveline       RWD           Horsepower       271 HP           Torque       310 pound-feet           0-60 MPH       5.8 Seconds           Top Speed       125 MPH             On the other hand, a three-year-old Model 3 gives you many of the same features for significantly less money, with the added bonus of lower depreciation moving forward. Buying used means you'll save about 20- to 30-percent off the original MSRP without sacrificing much in terms of functionality. However, the trade-off might be a shorter remaining warranty and older technology that could become outdated as Tesla has rolled out the facelifted version of the Model 3 just this year.

Trim Options:  The 2024 Tesla Model 3 introduces a facelift to the lineup, with improved range and slightly enhanced features across all trims. While the trims remain largely the same—Standard Range, Long Range, and Performance—the 2024 versions include slight updates in both design and functionality, keeping them more in line with Tesla’s evolving technology.                              Powertrain:  The core electric drivetrain in both the 2021 and 2024 Model 3 remains similar, but the 2024 model benefits from improvements in battery efficiency and power management. This translates to slightly faster charging times and a more refined driving experience.                              Range:  The 2024 Model 3 offers an improvement in range over its 2021 counterpart. For example, the Long Range trim now pushes up to 376 miles on a single charge, compared to 353 miles in the 2021 model. This slight increase makes the newer version more attractive for those looking to maximize their driving distance between charges.                              Pricing:  Starting at approximately $40,000, the 2024 Tesla Model 3 has a higher base price than the 2021 model did at launch. This reflects the added features, including better battery management and updated hardware for the Full Self-Driving package.                              Interior & Features:  While the minimalist, tech-focused interior design remains consistent, the 2024 Model 3 comes with improved materials and a quieter cabin. Tesla has refined the soundproofing and added more durable upholstery options to the latest model. The touchscreen interface in the 2024 version also operates faster.                              Overall, the  2024 Tesla Model 3 builds upon the solid foundation  of the 2021 model, offering more range, more refined driving, and small but impactful interior updates that will appeal to those seeking the latest in electric vehicle "

Tesla Is Losing Ground Fast In The Most EV-Friendly Place In America - The Autopian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQTkFrZW9Xc0tfZFBialNXWkk2bElIMG1yNko5V3JQbi00LVNTRUdzaEFsUk5yNTZibTBwai1vX1RpaXdxZkwyLVNJMi1COUtKNmhiMldYTFUzNWtibVhfZmVkS0hYQlNkZFJOVEhzYVl0b0VRUFkyYjBCQTE5Nk5sQktWUThFMDBpdktyM3hmR2d5ZkZBcjZLdHpQQ194bnBTTkJOVzFxbzBTRUdwcFNoNGtB?oc=5,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Because it’s election season there’s a lot of talk about “bellwethers.” These are counties or regions where the population just happens to have the right mix of voters to be predictive of larger trends. The Washington congressional primary,  for instance , is one of the traditional bellwethers for the presidential race, as it features a voter skew that can be prescriptive of Midwestern and Rust Belt trends.   If there’s a place in America that’s a “bellwether” for electric vehicles it’s Silicon Valley and, specifically Santa Clara County. It’s also a place where Tesla is losing ground fast to its rivals. Why?     Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   While we’re exploring the big questions in this chapter of The Morning Dump, why do we think used car sales suddenly took off in August? The UAW has a lot of questions for Stellantis. Specifically, the union would like to know if the company is going to ship Dodge Durango production somewhere else.   And, finally, how can Volkswagen save some money as it faces an uncertain future? Hint: It’s probably layoffs.   “More And More People Have Just Had It With [Musk]”   Credit:  depositphotos.com   Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously moved the HQ of his company from Silicon Valley, where Tesla was born, to Austin, Texas. It could have just been about tax breaks, or whatever, but Musk himself has said it’s because of laws signed by Governor Gavin Newsom that create more protections  for LGBTQ+ students . It’s part of a larger pattern of strong opinions from Musk, lately, especially on his own platform.   Do people care? There’s  some evidence that people are not buying Teslas as Musk’s favorability slips , though Tesla is still by far the biggest electric carmaker in America and I know plenty of people who held their noses and bought Model Ys because they were such a good deal.   I think it depends on where you are and who you are. People in West Virginia, for instance, might support Musk’s views and be more amenable to buying Teslas, even if West Virginia has one of the lowest adoption rates for EVs in the country.   Earlier I mentioned that Silicon Valley is a bellwether for electric car purchases. I remember visiting Stanford right at the beginning of the EV revolution and marveling at how many EVs I saw (mostly Teslas and Leafs because that’s all there really was). The data backs this up. Two of the main counties that make up Silicon Valley (Santa Clara and San Mateo) are also two of the biggest counties in the United States by  EV miles traveled per capita .   If you want to look anywhere to find out what people want in terms of electric cars it’s a great place to start.   So, how’s it going? According to S&P Mobility,  via this  Automotive News  article , it’s not going well for Tesla:   “I pull up to an intersection and every car is a Tesla Model Y, and I’m also driving one because it’s the modern Toyota Camry,” said Loren McDonald, head of Silicon Valley consultancy EVAdoption. “But there are a lot of reluctant Tesla owners who don’t want to give Elon any more money. More and more people have just had it with him.”   In Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, new Tesla registrations fell 22 percent from January through July from the same period a year earlier, while EV rivals saw 41 percent growth, according to S&P Global Mobility. The data includes new battery-electric vehicles but not hybrids.   Santa Clara is home to Google, Apple, Intel, Stanford, and a bunch of other traditionally EV-forward companies and institutions. The dramatic decline in Tesla registrations, while everyone else is going up, isn’t a great sign. Some of this is probably due to big price cuts in Teslas last year, which took some buyers out of the market. Tesla also fell 21% across all Silicon Valley counties, though rivals only grew by 1.4% when the other counties are considered.   So who is picking up market share from Tesla?   Tesla was still the top EV brand in California with 56 percent of the market, although that was a big drop from its 64 percent share in the year-earlier period, according to S&P Global Mobility.   Brands gaining on Tesla for EV registrations include Hyundai with 55 percent growth from January through July compared with a year earlier. Rivian had a 50 percent rise and Ford a 24 percent gain, S&P Global Mobility said. California’s total EV registrations reached 232,353 in the seven-month period.   Competition was always inevitable for Tesla and the degree to which Musk’s behavior is accelerating a market share decline is likely hard to prove. Still, if there’s any state in the nation to be turned off by Musk it’s probably California.   Used Car Sales Surge In August   Source: Cox Automotive   I mentioned this summer that the used car market was  acting in somewhat unpredictable ways , and it’s only getting weirder. If you’re a buyer you should embrace the weirdness like a dad who has been dragged to 100 gecs concert. It’s good for you!   In particular, sales are way way way up in August. A total of 1.7 million used cars were sold at retail dealerships, up 13.6% year-over-year and 8% month-over-month. Just look at that graphic. With new car sales held back by interest rates, economic uncertainty, the election, et cetera, why are used car sales suddenly doing better?   Cox Automotive  has an explanation , and it’s a positive one for consumers:   “Used retail sales picked up steam in August as affordability in the used market improved slightly,” said Scott Vanner, senior analyst of Economic and Industry Insights at Cox Automotive. “The increase in sales is partly attributed to the change in inventory mix, with a notable rise in units sold priced under $15,000 in August.”   It’s almost like America wants affordable cars. Crazy!   Where Is The Durango Going?     The Dodge Durango is a vehicle sold in the United States, which is how I would describe it to anyone asking me if they should buy one. Some people like it. It does have an available V8 and has resisted the softening that’s plagued a lot of three-row crossovers. Sales are only down 11% year-over-year, which is better than a lot of Stellantis products.   It’s currently a vehicle built in the Detroit Assembly Complex-Jefferson, which is known to all normal human beings as Jefferson North. The UAW doesn’t think it’s going to keep being built there and is pissed. Everyone else is just confused as to why the UAW thinks this is happening.   What does Stellantis have to say?   From  the  Detroit Free Press :   “[T]he union said it filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against the automaker that owns the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat brands for its “illegal refusal to provide information about the company’s plans regarding product commitments,” which the union said also violates the contract.   Stellantis provided a statement about the unfair labor practice charges, which were confirmed by an NLRB spokeswoman. However, the company response did not answer questions about the alleged efforts to move Durango production.   Huh. That’s strange! I wonder why they won’t directly answer such a simple question.   Volkswagen Is Ditching Its In-House Captive Finance Company     If you’re an employee at Volkswagen Financial Services it might be a good time to update your resume as the company has announced it’s going to stop writing loans and instead kick that business to Wells Fargo starting next week. VWFS will still handle loans and other “usage-based” products.   What about the company’s employees?   Per  Automotive News :   According to a Volkswagen Financial Services employee who asked not to be identified, executive leadership has said organizational change would occur because of the Wells Fargo partnership but provided no details. However, team leaders have predicted large job cuts to the U.S. operation would arise, the employee said. Volkswagen had not responded about the employee’s account and assessment.   Bummer.   What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD   VIDEO   There’s a gray, cool sky out my window and it looks the way Belle & Sebastian make me feel. Piazza, New York Catcher, are you straight or are you gay?   The Big Question   Is Silicon Valley a canary in a coalmine or just a weird place whose experiences can’t be extrapolated?

James May Surprisingly Really Likes The Tesla Cybertruck - The Autopian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE9NZExtSmN3SE9Ha2NUN0VVV0hvVUNHZ29kU2JjRlBzSk1TNkFwWWd5ODNsY21zS2N5aXpVeGx4NWF6T2hvXzZhTVE4UVBycm1fV0wwMm16TFk3Q1pDV1JHUmRpU1pHWllNRjBiWnlYVQ?oc=5,"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","We’ve heard a lot about the  Tesla Cybertruck  over the last year. We’ve heard the rumors, we’ve heard  David Tracy’s take , and we’ve heard about  a number of controversial issues.  Now, we’re finally hearing from Captain Slow himself.   James May has been kind enough to throw his review on that most open of video sites, YouTube. There are high production values, that measured delivery honed on  Top Gear,  and the California coastline as a gorgeous backdrop. It’s good stuff.     Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck Moving Adventures With The Tesla Cybertruck   The real question is what Mr. May thinks of this most controversial of “trucks.” Believe it or not? He’s a fan.   VIDEO   May takes the Cybertruck for a little drive, hands on the yoke-y wheel as he expounds upon the vehicle’s place in the automotive world. “We’re supposed to think of this car as radical,” says May. “Is this the Countach of the modern era, or maybe the Lagonda, or the DeLorean?” he asks. He notes that a lot of these designs  have a “wow” factor, similarly being very angular with lots of flat planes.   “The flatness means that it has to be very very precisely made,” says May. On that note, he points out some of the visible flaws of the example he’s driving. “If you look here very closely, this piece here, on the A-pillar, that doesn’t align absolutely perfectly,” he explains. “It’s only a millimeter or so out, but you can see that, because it’s a straight line and a flat surface.” There’s also the simple fact that it’s quite a pointy machine. “It’s also got quite sharp edges, I wouldn’t want to be hit by it…” he says. In particular, he highlights the pointed corners up front. “You don’t really get corners on the fronts of cars normally but you do there!”   Sharp edges have been a bit of a pain point for Cybertruck owners.   May also notes that the Cybertruck isn’t as flat as it looks.   May also notes that sometimes in design, you need to create slightly curved surfaces instead of purely flat ones. “If you make things perfectly flat, especially when they’re shiny, they appear to be slightly shrunken,” he explains. Thus, he suspects the Cybertruck’s panels may indeed be slightly “bulbous” to counteract this visual effect. He inspects the vehicle with a steel rule, quickly determining that the “bonnet” (hood) has “a bit of a curve to it.” He then notes that most of the supposedly flat panels are indeed slightly “convex.”   Does May like the flat-plane futuristic aesthetic, though? He takes a moment to examine the vehicle and contemplate whether he actually likes it or not. “Yes, I do!” he decides. Fair enough, then.   Those flat panels can make filming a pain at times.   May also uses the video as an opportunity to plug his own brand of gin.    The video also gets a little meta. “If you’re a YouTuber, [it’s] very difficult to film,” he explains. “Pretty much wherever you stand, you can see yourself… it’s like a hall of mirrors.” Obviously, that’s less of a problem when it gets a bit grimy and fingerprinted up—worth considering if you’re filming your own example.   He also tackles enjoyable minutae as well. “It’s got the quietest electric windows I’ve ever encountered!” he says. “I think that’s probably better than an S Class.” He also has some criticisms, including the wide pillars, which harm visibility, and the annoyance of having to change things like the A/C temperature with the touchscreen.   The power windows are apparently exceptionally quiet. That’s the kind of gem you only get out of a James May review.    “I suppose technically the most radical thing about the Cybertruck is that it is entirely steer-by-wire,” he notes. “If you sit and think about that a bit, it’s quite alarming.” However, he notes the benefits, including being able to make relatively small inputs to steer the vehicle with the yoke.   Would James own one, though? Not quite. “I’ll be honest with you… I don’t want a Cybertruck,” he says. “It’s too big, [and] I have a slight aversion to pickup trucks. if I’m honest.” But he appreciates it for what it is. “It’s all straight lines, flat surfaces, vertices, but it makes everything look square,” he says. “It is a little bit childish, and a bit incel… but for the most part, it’s like a Tesla.” Fundamentally, though, he sees it as a bold piece of design, and he appreciates it on that basis.   Captain Slow approves, as it turns out!   As for the ultimate verdict? “I think the Cybertruck is actually very ballsy, and quite humorous,” he says. “But I am quite glad it exists.” More than that though, it has him contemplating future models. “If I could make a little appeal to Elon Musk, could you make something about the size of the Model Y, or maybe even a little bit smaller… but styled like this?” he asks. “I’d go for that!”   Image credits: James May’s Planet Gin via YouTube Screenshot"

Fire destroys multiple cars at Tesla service center; Arson suspected - 10News.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOWnlrY1NZVGFFN0dYT1NfaVNSaTdSNXhaNGJzSWZIQVhERGFBczVDQ3ZkMVJaOTlGcHBUOU1XY1dBcHVzM1hwWWt5aGNzcWVia2dhLTNrTm9CVDlVYVN1V1NjdzlQdHZSWEgwZ3d0bzUzN1g0TVBncWUwVV9lUXh0Y3ZJUDNVQklHN1BqRS1QbllLLVEzRXNDcHpHMHdPM1J1aFNQU0tiYnRXQ1RFTkE?oc=5,"Fri, 13 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","SAN DIEGO (KGTV) – A fire destroyed multiple Tesla cars at a service center in Miramar early Friday morning, and investigators are now considering the possibility of arson. The fire broke out around 2:30 a.m. at the Tesla facility on Trade Place, authorities said.  San Diego Police officers and Fire-Rescue crews arrived to find four Teslas fully engulfed in flames, with the fire scorching part of the service center building. Firefighters were able to stop the flames from spreading further, but the blaze completely destroyed the four vehicles.     KGTV     A member of the Metro Arson Strike Team told ABC 10News that lithium-ion batteries in the cars reignited several hours later, at about 6:30 a.m.  These types of batteries, commonly used in electric vehicles, can be difficult to extinguish once ignited and may flare up again even after the fire is thought to be under control, authorities said.  Arson investigators are still sifting through the damage, but officials confirmed foul play is being considered as a possible cause. This incident follows similar lithium-ion battery fires, including  one last week at an SDG&E battery facility in Escondido  and  another at a storage site in Otay Mesa .

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

Here's How Much It Costs To Charge A Tesla In The USA's Most Expensive State - CarBuzz,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE1pTHJPSFd2ZGhHTmY1ZVhZdk1sY0JnZ0hyWjFZNURqeDhpWWk0bEZJaVdocUhYdlc0cW01a3hqSEFHcFdXTk1ObVRucDVNN2N0MlhrWmlmUWlHdkVsTEF4Y0cyT2hCcjF2N3p6cHFUM2U?oc=5,"Sun, 29 Sep 2024 07:00:00 GMT","EV ownership isn’t always a smooth ride, depending on where in the US you are located. While some states are conducive to buying an EV as a daily driver, thanks to well-developed infrastructure, low electricity prices, and incentives, other locations are less favorable. Since charging is a big part of the day-to-day experience of owning and driving an electric car, the  ease of charging your vehicle  will need to be one of the first things to look into when considering a future purchase.   While, on average, the price of electricity is lower than that of gas, and reduced running costs are frequently cited as a reason to make the jump into EV ownership, the cost of charging, especially when on the move and using  public chargers , is still a source of concern for people investigating the possibility of buying an electric vehicle. One state in particular has the highest electricity prices in the US, creating an obstacle to EV ownership: let’s look into how much it would cost for you to charge your Tesla if you were a resident of Hawaii.                            Why Is Hawaii The Most Expensive State For EV Owners?                                       HawaiiBusiness.com         The main obstacle to owning an EV in Hawaii comes in the form of extremely high electricity costs, the highest in the US. There are several reasons for pricey power in the state, but ultimately it all boils down to geographical isolation. Hawaii’s electrical infrastructure relies heavily on fossil fuels such as oil. Electricity generated by burning fossil fuels accounts for around  80% of power produced  in Hawaii.   This creates a large (and expensive) logistical barrier. Oil needs to be shipped from the mainland across the ocean, in order to be used in local power plants. This process involves a high amount of labor and infrastructure, which incurs high costs. This means production costs are already high even before a single kW of electricity has been produced.                            The Cost Of Charging Your Tesla In Hawaii                   As of May 2024, the  average cost of electricity in Hawaii  was 44.14 cents per kWh according to Statista. As the current best-selling Tesla model in the US, we will look at the Model Y as an example. The Long Range variant has a battery capacity of 78.1 kWh. Now that we have the required figures for the cost of electricity and the vehicle’s battery capacity, the calculation is a fairly simple one: the cost of a full charge equals the battery capacity multiplied by the cost per kWh. 78.1 multiplied by $0.4414 equals a full charge price of  $34.47 : this is, on average, how much it will cost to charge your Tesla Model Y as a Hawaii resident.   On the low and high ends of the spectrum when it comes to battery capacity, we find the base-trim Model 3 (which, with a capacity of 58 kWh, will cost you around  $25.60  to charge) and the Model S (which has a capacity of 100 kWh, leading to an estimated charging cost of  $44.14 ). This means, on average, you can expect to pay somewhere between $25 and $45 to charge your Tesla as a Hawaii resident.                            Green Power: Electric Vehicles In Hawaii                                       Hawaiian Electric/Facebook         However, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are several aspects of life in Hawaii that make electric car ownership a viable option. One such aspect is the generation of  solar electricity . While Hawaii’s power grid is currently heavily reliant on fossil fuels, solar power is also growing rapidly thanks to naturally abundant sunlight. Hawaii is actually a national leader when it comes to solar power generated per capita, indicating the overall trend is progressing in the right direction; in some areas, the amount of solar power generated at midday is actually greater than the demand for electricity. If the solar infrastructure is developed further going forward, electricity costs are bound to fall and EV ownership will become an increasingly attractive option.   There are other factors that make Hawaii an ideal environment for electric cars to thrive: the limited geographical area is one of them. Hawaii Island, the largest island in the state, measures around 4,000 square miles, while Oahu, the island home to the state capital Honolulu, measures around 600 square miles.         Related     Not large by any means, but all of these cars are bangers.           These small dimensions, along with low average speeds throughout the state, make Hawaii an ideal testing ground for the expansion of electric vehicles, given that range anxiety is still a prevalent concern among present and prospective EV owners. The local climate is also a point in favor of EVs: thanks to mild temperatures, electric vehicles are less likely to suffer from the issues that normally affect them in colder areas, such as loss of driving range.   A number of EV-friendly policies have also been implemented by the state in recent years. These include access to High Occupancy Vehicle lanes for EVs, free parking in state- and county-run parking lots, and legal requirements for public parking lots to include EV charging spaces, as well as requirements for apartment buildings to allow the installation of electric car chargers. Hawaiian culture places high importance on looking after the land, and encouraging electric vehicle usage is a part of the effort to safeguard the local environment.                            Charging Your EV: The Basics                                       Electrify America         The majority of  electric vehicle charging  happens at home; after having been used throughout the day, the car is charged overnight, usually in a garage, on a driveway, or in a residential parking lot for an apartment block. Home charging is typically the cheapest way to run an electric car, as you will be able to take advantage of whatever your home’s electricity costs are instead of having to pay for the use of a public charger.   However, this is also a slower method. Many home setups, especially older ones, are Level 1 chargers (which use standard 120V household current). This means you will typically need to leave the car plugged in for several hours, if not days, to get a full charge. Level 1 chargers are only a viable day-to-day solution for Tesla owners who have access to overnight charging and a short commute, keeping daily mileage low.         Related     If you have a home charger, owning an EV goes from challenging to hassle-free.            Tesla’s own wall connectors are Level 2 chargers, meaning they can access up to 240V: this makes them a good option for everyday use, allowing the car to fully charge overnight and make use of its full range, from longer commutes to school runs and everything in between.   If you need to charge your car while out and about, or while on a long-distance road trip, public chargers are also an option. There are several different kinds available, depending on your location; while most public chargers are Level 2, some are Level 3, more commonly known as “fast chargers”. These allow a vehicle to reach 80% charge within a very short timeframe, cutting downtime during long journeys and allowing you to get back on the road sooner. While all EVs sold in the US are compatible with Level 1 and Level 2 chargers, only some models are compatible with Level 3 chargers.                            Tesla And Charging: Home Chargers And The Supercharger Network                                       Tesla         Tesla, of course, isn’t quite like other EV brands when it comes to charging. The company has set up its own fast charging system dubbed the Supercharger network, which offers Tesla owners exclusive access to proprietary fast chargers (that being said, other carmakers’ models are now due to have access to the Supercharger network soon, negating the exclusivity factor). Two Supercharger stations are currently active in Hawaii, and a third is under construction. All three are located on the island of Oahu. A fourth location, also on Oahu, is currently an available option for a  public vote  on where to install future Superchargers; Tesla owners are able to cast their vote for their preferred location on the brand’s website.   The brand also offers a  wall connector  for charging at home; as Hawaii is a small geographical area, it is likely most people will be able to get around solely by charging their car at home overnight rather than having to stop at public chargers. As even apartment blocks have an obligation to allow the installation of EV chargers, the type of dwelling shouldn’t have an excessive impact on an EV owner’s ability to charge their car at home.

Michael Wayland / CNBC DETROIT – Spaceship. Dream car. UFO. Dumpster. Cool. Stupid. Phenomenal. Abomination. Those were all words used to describe the  Tesla  Cybertruck during a 24-hour rental of the vehicle in metropolitan Detroit. They were expressed by strangers, friends, family, and auto industry experts and employees. A word not used much? “Truck.” That’s because the Tesla Cybertruck is far more “cyber” than “truck.” It indeed has some truck capabilities, such as a pickup bed and other utilitarian features, but it is not a truck in any traditional sense of the word. It is a unique product that only comes along every so often. Similar to the first SUV, minivan or “roadster pickups” such as the Ford Ranchero and Chevrolet El Camino, it has created a new segment in the automotive industry that it solely holds. That’s good and bad for both Tesla and its competitors, specifically the truck-reliant automakers from Detroit that have spent decades refining their trucks to meet the needs of their customers. That includes things such as bed access and door handle sizes to seating height and interior components. The Cybertruck is not a direct competitor for electric trucks from traditional automakers. The Cybertruck is a “truck” for Tesla fans/owners and an experiment for the company in many ways regarding its technologies, including a new electrical architecture and steering system. Fronts of the Ford F-150 Lightning, Tesla Cybertruck and GMC Sierra Denali EVs (left to right). Michael Wayland / CNBC The top vehicles that are cross-shopped for the Cybertruck are Tesla’s other four models, followed by the Ford F-150 Lightning in a distant fifth at 7.4% of potential buyers, according to Edmunds.com. I drove a roughly $100,000 all-wheel-drive version of the Cybertruck in regular driving conditions and traffic in Detroit and its surrounding suburbs, including a short torrential downpour in which the vehicle’s comically large wiper blade performed fine. I did not test the vehicle’s towing or hauling capabilities, which have come into question recently following reports of problems involving the durability of the vehicle’s aluminum frame. Most notably, in an over-the-top viral video from  YouTube channel WhistlinDiesel . I wanted to have better first-hand knowledge of the vehicle and compare it with electric trucks from other automakers, but that was harder than initially expected. I also purposely did not watch or read any reviews ahead of time about the vehicle before driving it. Driving the Cybertruck The Cybertruck is unlike any other vehicle I’ve ever driven. That includes every all-electric truck on sale today from  General Motors ,  Ford Motor  and  Rivian Automotive . The only vehicle to come close to a similar driving experience is  GM’s Hummer EV . Both are large, gaudy and outlandish vehicles that are more infamous than they are practical. But the Hummer EV still feels like a truck in its driving dynamics, seating and overall functionality. The Cybertruck does not. A Tesla Cybertruck near General Motors’ Renaissance Center world headquarters in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC The Cybertruck features tight steering, including a yoke and “steer-by-wire” system; a stiff chassis similar to a sports car; and, while arbitrary, a design that is far more form than function, which is historically one of the top reasons to purchase a pickup truck. The seating also feels far more like a car than a truck. Even when the vehicle is at its “high” setting, which it can only be in under 25 mph, it’s still several inches lower than most electric trucks. That’s not to say it isn’t “tough.” As seen  on YouTube , the company and owners have shot bullets at it, thrown steel balls at its windows and done other less-than-industry-standard tests. Having said that, the vehicle I drove had just more than 2,000 miles on it and I found two pieces of trim peeling off along the rolling bed cover’s sealant/guide rails. Potential problems with the durability of the frame are concerning. It is the base of the vehicle that everything is built on. For a vehicle’s frame to break,  even in severe testing conditions , is a serious problem. Regarding its polarizing design, it’s on another level of its own. It makes GMC’s Hummer seem normal. Heads turned, jaws dropped and there were even a few people yelling or screaming, including one fellow driver aggressively giving me a thumbs down as I passed (some Cybertruck drivers have reported  more explicit gestures ). The reactions came from toddlers and school children to construction workers and police officers. Interior Inside the doorstop-shaped, stainless-steel alloy exoskeleton of the Cybertruck is where things get more interesting. The interior of the vehicle, like its other Tesla siblings, is described by many as “minimalistic.” I’d call it sparse and, in some material choices, cheap for a $100,000 vehicle. Given its size, the interior of the vehicle also feels more like a car than a “truck.” Interior of a Tesla Cybertruck Michael Wayland / CNBC There’s about 3½ feet of unusable space from the driver to the bottom of the vehicle’s windshield, while the back seat is fine for a car but a little lacking for space compared with  today’s full-size pickup trucks . The centerpiece of the vehicle’s interior is a large 18.5-inch, center-mounted touchscreen and minimal controls on the steering wheel, or yoke. What the Tesla Cybertruck lacks in “truck-ness” and interior qualities, it arguably makes up for in technology, as well as the human-machine interface, or HMI, of the vehicle with the driver. That includes the gear shifter being a long rectangle in the top left of the screen for drive, park and reverse. It functioned well and I did not miss having to use a traditional shifter, although there are such buttons hidden in the vehicle’s roof, above the screen. The “shifter” on the Tesla Cybertruck is the long rectangle on the left of the vehicle’s center control screen. Michael Wayland / CNBC The processing speed of the infotainment system is impressive, especially when compared with other non-Tesla EVs from traditional automakers. It’s also very manageable, despite the amount of information displayed on the screen. I’d still prefer a screen in front of the driver or a heads-up display for speed and other rudimentary information projected on the vehicle’s windshield but it didn’t bother or distract me as much as I thought it would. The vehicle’s mirrors also were largely unusable, and likely only there to meet federal safety standard requirements. The Cybertruck’s camera system, which functions in lieu of useful mirrors, took a little getting used to but worked just fine (several automakers have usable mirrors along with such camera systems that show the rear and sides of the vehicle). Tech focused I was able to use the vehicle’s adaptive cruise control system, which Tesla infamously calls Autopilot, but not more advanced systems such as “FSD,” which Cybertruck customers can order but isn’t yet available. The system’s ability to spot and display other vehicles, streetlights, people and even traffic cones, stop signs and garbage cans on the screen was impressive, but it was nothing more than a standard adaptive cruise control when driving. It also stopped at every traffic light whether it was green, yellow or red. Another surprising feature was the yoke replacing a traditional steering wheel. Again, this is a feature more popular with race cars than pickup trucks, but it functioned well. It does not rotate fully, instead going about 180 degrees or so for a full turn. Input needed is minimal when changing lanes. The ease also comes from the vehicle’s four-wheel steering and steer-by-wire system. The Tesla Cybertruck is unveiled at Tesla’s design studio on Nov. 21, 2019, in Hawthorne, Calif.  Both steering features are emerging technologies being used or looked into by other automakers. The four-wheel steer makes it so a large vehicle such as the Cybertruck or GMC Hummer, which also features it, can turn more tightly than a traditional truck. It’s more similar to the turn radius of a car, which helps maneuver the vehicle into tighter places and parking spots. The steer-by-wire is harder to describe. The system uses electronics and software to control a vehicle’s steering without a mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the wheels. It feels almost like a racing yoke for a video game or aircraft rather than a traditional vehicle. “You can make it perform much differently. … It gives you much more of a performance bandwidth,” said Terry Woychowski, president of automotive at engineering consulting firm Caresoft Global. A Tesla Cybertruck next to a GMC Hummer EV SUV. Michael Wayland / CNBC Woychowski, a former GM executive whose company has  tested and benchmarked the Cybertruck , said the steer-by-wire feature is “discretionary.” But he described the change in the vehicle’s electrical architecture that powers all of its systems as “bare bones, engineering efficiency” that has been a needed change for years. The Cybertruck features a 48-volt architecture to power the components of the vehicle. Doing so allows for additional electrical bandwidth for a vehicle and eliminates the need for a traditional 12-volt battery to power things such as windows, seats and headlights. Tesla is the first to offer such a 48-volt system on a pure EV. Tesla CEO  Elon Musk  infamously sent competitors such as Ford and GM essentially a “how-to” guide on developing such a system. The benefit with using the higher voltage for auxiliary devices is that the same power can be supplied at a lower current. It can save weight and cost as the wiring is about half the size.

EV Energy Usage Explained                                       Tesla                      What Is A Kilowatt?        Understanding energy for electric cars is quite different to understanding energy in a conventional gas-powered car, although, in many ways, also similar. A gas car will take onboard a gallon of fuel, and burn through it in exchange for miles. If the car can achieve 40 miles of range with that gallon of fuel, it can be rated at 40 miles per gallon – simple enough. Electric cars work in the same way, albeit with different metrics.   Instead of a 15-gallon fuel tank, an EV like a Tesla may have a battery size of 50 kWh, which means the battery can store up to 50-kilowatt hours worth of energy, or 'fuel'. One kWh is enough electricity to supply 1,000 watts of power, for one hour – one example would be powering a 250-watt appliance for four hours. In a Tesla, those kWh are used to provide miles on the road. If, for example, a Tesla could achieve 40 miles per kWh, then that would be the efficiency rating.                How Much Does Electricity Cost?        Gas fuel is so well integrated into our everyday life, the costs are pretty well known.  Statista currently provides $3.21 as the national average  for how much a gallon of gas costs, while $3.60 is the cost for diesel. While that cost does fluctuate from one area to the next, it certainly doesn't vary in the wild ways that electricity does.   Using data collected from Statista  about the average cost of energy in each state, we calculated that the national average is $0.1716 per kWh. The cheapest area for electricity was in Utah, at just over 11 cents per kWh – the cost in Hawaii was almost exactly four times higher. The average provided of 17.16 cents is taken from all states.

Charging A Tesla Takes More Energy Than You Would First Assume                   There is an ideal scenario for charging an electric car, and it's really quite simple. In theory, a 75-kWh battery from the  2024 Tesla Model 3  Long Range and Performance models should take 75 kWh of energy to charge, which would make the equation nice and simple to calculate. However, as ever, nothing is 100% efficient, and there are energy losses to factor in. Some energy will be lost through the cables, and as with all electrical uses, some energy will be lost due to heat generation.   The type of charger used to charge a Tesla will also have an impact on the amount of energy lost, as AC-DC power conversion will sap the power potential. For maximum efficiency, DC fast charging will be most effective, as this conversion does not need to happen. However, fast-charging all the time can dampen the longevity of a battery, which means the battery will be less efficient, and would need charging more often. There is rarely a win-win scenario when it comes down to which charger is best.   According to  Inside EVs , the losses can be quite significant, although  10% can be considered a working average  for energy losses through charging an electric car. This means, in order to calculate the amount of kWh required to charge a Tesla, an average energy loss of 10% needs to be factored in.         Related     There are a wide range of options when it comes to electric car chargers for your home, but they all need a dedicated power source. You will need to have an electrician install either a 240-volt plug, like what's used for your dryer, or hardwire the charger into your home. The cost can vary greatly depending on where you have the charger installed and the electrical setup in your home, so get several quotes to get the best price.                                    How Different Chargers Affect The Efficiency Of Charging A Tesla                                       Tesla                      Different Charger Types            Supercharger : Up to 200 miles of range in 15 minutes                              Wall Connector : Up to 44 miles of range per hour of charge                              Destination Charging : Up to 44 miles of range per hour of charge                              Mobile Charging (240V) : Up to 30 miles of range per hour of charge                              Mobile Charging (120V) : Up to 3 miles of range per hour of charge                              Tesla offers a wide choice of chargers to its customers , each providing a unique set of benefits and disadvantages. The most effective is Tesla's Supercharger network. These fast chargers are hugely capable, and can provide up to 200 miles of charge in just 15 minutes – naturally, these are usually stationed in high traffic areas, such as in busy cities, or on the highways. Using these constantly can have a negative impact on the effectiveness of a car's battery, and can cost more too, as the energy provided is often charged at a higher dollar-per-kWh cost than in a residential setting.   For this and other reasons, most customers will choose to charge their Tesla models at home, via a wall connector. This method provides up to 44 miles of charge per hour, and is not too damaging to the battery. It is also common for energy providers to charge less per kWh throughout the night, which is why it makes great sense to charge a Tesla overnight, at home. Destination charging is much the same, and can be found at workplaces and hotels.   Mobile charging is less effective, but certainly useful when no other option is available. Through a typical household outlet, only 3 miles of range per hour are added, although this jumps up to 30 miles of range per hour, if accessed via a 240V outlet.         Discussion     How do you get an EV charger installed? Some cars come with a charger or a credit to have it installed. If it doesn't, you can always research local electricians that can install it and purchase one from various stores and online retailers.                                    Here's How Much Energy It Takes To Charge A Tesla In 2024                                       Tesla          So, in order to calculate how many kilowatts it takes to charge a Tesla, the inefficiencies of charging have to be taken into account, which we will represent as an average of 10%. While many new models, such as  the Tesla Model Y Juniper , are set to be released soon, we have used a range of only current 2024 models as examples. The calculation is relatively simple, and can be displayed as the total kWh required (battery capacity), multiplied by 1 + the efficiency loss percentage, or, in this instance, 1.10.   Using this method, we know that the amount of energy required to charge an entry-level Tesla Model 3's 58-kWh battery is 63.8 kWh. As for how many kWh you'll need to charge a Tesla Model Y Long Range, that works out to 89.1 kWh. Taking into account the most amount of energy lost is the Tesla Cybertruck (in Cyberbeast trim), wasting a total of 12.3 kWh in energy loss, in order to charge the 123-kWh battery pack. The different Tesla kWh capacity specs per model are listed below.

Tesla set to report Q3 deliveries ahead of robotaxi event - CNBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNZS1EczZ1Slk1aFdtVHpaVVpIcGtQVGRLV3ZLTWVZUlctdEswNXZDbHFjT2ZCSnQ4bzhVb3lySVEwVmRwdWVlNU94OTdFbVVYcDBOMktTd0lZZVozTnNtbTBFa0hGMlRnWldzNjdWQ1kyMEU3OUd1cjdLWHl2aWhhMHJLODZaWWFmdnIxMkdzWWFpdFnSAZgBQVVfeXFMUHAxX19yZGJGVDBRWHdiQkVvMXhBS3hORHhua1VCQzJEN1pLYXY3TWE4TnlkRkhEak1ZdTQtd2c2Y2NUaGFrbTZVdUQwYUtYQVBZWTZRU2d1SHBaMTd2T2ZhZUJCdWVKU05fajJpQkh2TDF0U055blYydzBxSGZ2Q0VxMzFNU25DZnF2ZFkzYW9ydDE1Z181YUw?oc=5,"Tue, 01 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla  is set to report third-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers on Wednesday.  Analysts are expecting  Elon Musk ’s automaker to report about 463,310 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. That would include about 435,900 of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs. Tesla reported deliveries of 435,059 and production of 430,488 vehicles for the  same period a year ago , before it was selling the Cybertruck. More recently, Tesla reported deliveries of 443,956 and production of 410,831 vehicles for the second quarter of 2024. If Tesla meets analysts’ expectations that would represent a 6.5% year-over-year increase for deliveries after declines in the  first  and  second  quarters of 2024. Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but they are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. In the third quarter, as it did earlier this year, Tesla continued to offer a variety of incentives and financing plans to drive sales volumes, particularly in the largest market for EVs in the world, mainland China. Tesla hasn’t given specific guidance for the full year of deliveries in 2024, but the company has said it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last. Wells Fargo, pointing to this lack of guidance, said in a note that it’s expecting 1.63 million full-year deliveries for Tesla and third-quarter deliveries at around 440,000, below consensus. Goldman Sachs last week said it expects Tesla deliveries and production “to come in-line with consensus, largely driven by the strength in the China market.” Goldman Sachs recommended  buying call options  ahead of the Wednesday report. Robotaxi day in focus Shares in the EV maker are up more than 20% over the past month, in anticipation that deliveries could improve year over year and sequentially in the third quarter, and ahead of the company’s robotaxi day on Oct. 10. Tesla plans to host investors and fans at its “We, Robot” marketing event at a  Warner Bros. Discovery  movie studio in Los Angeles. The automaker is expected to show off the design of a “dedicated robotaxi,” which Musk has referred to previously as the CyberCab. Tesla may also provide updates on its humanoid robotics project “Optimus” and other automotive and AI-driven products and services. Tesla EV sales and revenue fell in the first half of 2024, and the company still has yet to deliver a self-driving system that can function as a robotaxi without a human driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time. Tesla also  renamed  its premium driver assistance option to Full Self-Driving Supervised, tacking on a disclaimer-style term at the end. Meanwhile, several rivals in the autonomous vehicle industry have begun producing robotaxis, and operating commercial robotaxi services. Rivals include  Alphabet -owned  Waymo  in the U.S., and  Pony.ai and Baidu  in China.  Amazon -owned Zoox is preparing a launch of a commercial robotaxi service in the U.S. as well. Tesla brand erosion Some customer interest in buying Tesla vehicles has been chilled by the brand’s strong association with Musk.  The company’s favorability among both liberal and conservative consumers fell in July, according to  CivicScience.  Tesla favorability dropped with Democrats to 18% in July, down from 39% in January, and it declined among Republicans to 22%, down from 36% in January.  Musk — who also leads SpaceX, X and xAI — has long shared provocative posts on social media, but in recent years, he’s become less filtered and more vociferous online about his right-wing political beliefs. In July, he  publicly endorsed  former President  Donald Trump , and he frequently posts screeds on X concerning illegal immigration, election fraud, crime, violence and other flashpoint issues. He has shared political misinformation and deepfakes with his massive online following on X, according to reports by  The Associated Press ,  CNN ,  NBC News,   The New York Times  and others. Before Musk acquired Twitter, now known as X, his feed focused more on Tesla and SpaceX, according to an analysis by  The Washington Post. Among the posts Musk recently spread on X were false claims that  Haitian immigrants  in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people’s pets. The Springfield Police Division, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and other local groups have all said the claims were baseless. It remains to be seen whether left-leaning customers’ view of Musk will weigh on deliveries this year.  Pew Research  has found that Democrats have a much more favorable view of battery-electric vehicles and are more likely to buy them than Republicans in the U.S."

Generally speaking, each model will have a variety of trims; some will focus on delivering value, while others focus instead on range, or outright performance.   To make sense of which model and trim is best for what, we've established what the best Tesla model for a wide range of uses is, looking at everything from technology and practicality, through to performance and value for money.

Through the Model S and subsequent products, Tesla has innovated and challenged industry conventions on numerous fronts, including over-the-air updates, self-driving technology, and automotive construction methods. Tesla is considered the world's most valuable car brand as of 2023, and the  Model Y the world's best-selling car  in the same year, but the brand's greatest achievement is arguably the Supercharger network of EV charging stations.

Related     A closer look at Tesla's Model S Plaid, an EV that boasts more mind-bending stats than most supercars.             1                                 Best Tesla For Performance                                     Tesla Model S Plaid                            Tesla          When shopping around for a blistering performance car, a four-door electric sedan would rarely be your first thought. However, in the case of the  Tesla Model S Plaid , things are a little different. The Tesla sports three electric motors, which work in cohesion with one another in order to develop a supercar-challenging 1,020 horsepower, alongside 1,050 lb-ft of torque.   Furthermore, as is the nature of electric cars, the Tesla does not need to fire through thousands of revs, or spool up a handful of turbochargers in order to access that immense power. Just plant your foot at a standstill, and it's there instantly. As a result, the Model S Plaid can complete a quarter mile run in just 9.4 seconds, hitting 60 mph along the way in a mind-blowing 1.99 seconds.

As impressive as the Plaid trim is, there is little point in the Model S being a four-door sedan if it can't also deliver on the more practical aspects of life, too. So, for those more interested in daily driving a Model S, the recommendation would be to ignore the headline-snatching Plaid, and instead opt for the much more sensible All-Wheel Drive model, previously known as the Long Range.   This sees the range swell to an impressive 402 miles, which is the most of any model from the firm at the moment, making it the best Tesla available for all things concerning range. Thanks to the ever-evolving Tesla Supercharger charging network, range anxiety can be a thing of the past, too, as the Model S AWD can add 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes at one of these fast-charging stations.         The Tesla Model S All-Wheel Drive only achieves 402 miles on standard 19-inch wheels. The range drops to 380 miles with the optional 21-inch wheels.

In the first and second rows, headroom is over 40 inches, and so is legroom too, almost, with the front seats offering 41.1 inches of room, and the second row providing 39.8 inches.   As is usually the case with all but the roomiest of minivans, the third row of seats is suitable mostly for young children, as here the headroom and legroom shrink down to 37.1 and 32.2 inches respectively. When traveling alone, drop the seats down and watch the cargo capacity swell from a respectable 15 cubic feet up to a cavernous 92.3 cubic feet. Besides that, the Model X has a frunk capacity of 6.5 cubes, while the rear Falcon Wing doors make entry into the rear of the interior easier.   If practicality is high up on your priorities list, this Tesla is the best model to have.     4                                 Best Sub-$40k Tesla                                     2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range                            Tesla         Electric cars are not what first springs to mind when asked about a 'cheap' car, and while the 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range is hardly cheap, it certainly is affordable for many. Prices start from just $38,990 for the Rear-Wheel Drive trim, but it's the marginally more expensive Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive trim that looks the best deal, at $42,490.   The eagle-eyed among you will notice that $42,490 is decidedly north of $40,000, but that's OK, as with the EV Tax Credit deductions of $7,500, the Model 3 falls firmly into the desired bracket. Tesla also claims that, with the incentives and average monthly gas savings factored in, the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive is available at just $485 per month.     5                                 Best Off-Road Tesla                                     Tesla Cybertruck                            Tesla          Tesla doesn't make much for the keen off-roader. In fact, until the Cybertruck arrived, they really did not cater for this segment of driving at all. To ensure that the controversial pickup truck can perform well on the rough stuff,  Tesla has equipped the model with numerous off-road modes , and the ability to raise the ride height on demand. Perfect for keeping the underside out of harms way. Furthermore, the dual-motor variant benefits from locking differentials, which will prove invaluable when traversing challenging terrain. This is undoubtedly one of the best Tesla models for more adventure-minded customers.     6                                 Best Tesla For Young Families                                     Tesla Model Y                            Tesla          For a car to work well for the whole family, it needs to offer a wide range of valuable features. Firstly, it needs to not cost an extortionate amount, and with prices beginning at just $44,990, the 2024 Tesla Model Y is certainly attainable. Secondly, it needs to be spacious enough –  the Model Y is available as a five or seven-seater , has an accommodating high roofline, and plenty of storage space too, so it easily ticks that box.   Now, for the kids. Tesla has redesigned the rear of the Model Y, to incorporate a 7.2-inch entertainment screen, which is perfect for keeping family members entertained on long drives. For all of those reasons, the Model Y is surely one of the best Tesla cars for young families.         Related     After years of delays, the new Roadster may finally be on the way. But is it still cutting-edge?             7                                 Best Tesla For Tech Nerds                                     Fully Loaded Tesla Model S                            Tesla          One of the main draws to owning a Tesla, is that the company is constantly innovating and adding new features to their whole range. While even the cheapest of models and trims come packed full of exciting tech, the Tesla Model S is really the one to have as a technophile.   Tesla allows owners to stand out from the crowd with a spaceship-esque yoke steering wheel, and while that's not exactly space-age technology, it's still pretty cool. The real lure, though, is the fact Tesla will allow you to spec a Model S with a full self-driving package, and that's about as futuristic as driving gets at the moment. What's more, the Drive Anywhere Package includes access to the entire Tesla Supercharging network, in addition to premium connectivity options too – a must-have option for anyone who loves their tech. The prices for these extras are as follows:                                              Yoke steering wheel: $1,000                                                                     Full Self-Driving package: $8,000                                                                     Drive Anywhere package: $5,000                                8                                 Best Bang For Your Buck                                     Tesla Model 3 Performance            "

Tesla, the EV market leader, ended a five-month slump with a 1.2% increase in registrations, bolstered by 5,175 deliveries of the highly anticipated Cybertruck launched in November. Other EV pickups combined sold just 5,546 units during the same period.   The surge in registrations reflects the growing appeal of EVs, aided by substantial incentives. For example, according to Motor Intelligence, consumers received $19,703 in discounts on the Kia EV9, $13,015 on the Volkswagen ID.4, and $7,035 on the Honda Prologue. Despite their typically higher retail prices, these factory and government incentives have helped make electric vehicles more competitive with their gasoline and hybrid counterparts.   However, analyst Tom Libby of S&P Global Mobility cautioned that the current sales boom heavily relies on these incentives. “At full MSRP, these EV products would not sell. They are being heavily incentivized to compete with internal combustion vehicles, and if these incentives were pulled, sales would drop dramatically,” Libby said.   Tesla maintained its dominance in the electric vehicle (EV) market, but its Model 3 sedan experienced a significant 31% drop in registrations. This decline was primarily attributed to the base model being ineligible for federal EV tax credits due to stricter battery-sourcing regulations implemented earlier in the year.     Despite Tesla’s dominance, non-Tesla EV registrations surged 38% year-over-year as competitors gained momentum. Hyundai Motor Group, which includes the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis brands, secured second place with 10,846 EV registrations. General Motors followed in third with 9,767 registrations across its Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC, and BrightDrop brands, while Ford Motor Co. ranked fourth with 9,504 registrations.   “This is the second wave of competitor vehicles,” Libby said. “These are very solid and competitive products affecting Tesla’s position.”   Nonetheless, total EV registrations for July reached 118,273, up from 100,620 in the previous year. EVs now represent 8.5% of the overall U.S. light-vehicle market, an increase from 7.6% a year earlier. In the first seven months of 2024, EV registrations grew by 8.7%, capturing a 7.6% market share, compared to 7.2% in the same period last year.   Despite the positive trend, there were signs of weakness in the broader EV market. Rivian, a major player in the EV space, saw a 0.3% decline in combined registrations for its R1S and R1T models in July. Rivian’s R1S crossover, the brand’s top-selling vehicle, saw an 18% drop in registrations as it faced competition from Kia’s EV9, which registered 1,960 units in July, surpassing the R1S.   Amid these challenges, Tesla’s overall growth and the strong performance of new entrants like the Honda Prologue and Kia EV9 suggest that the EV market continues to evolve, with fierce competition ahead as more automakers vie for leadership in this rapidly expanding segment."

A graphite thermal Tesla valve driven by hydrodynamic phonon transport - Nature,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1ZME1BWjE3eWlrQllNXzRIM2w2VlV2b2NoMjUyeTVGRUpIM3Y5dGRLX3E2S0VlenFhU3d5UmFnY3hrNG1jRjFaUVQzb0gtRzFhYmlLRkRLdzZnTlE2M0hF?oc=5,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Sample fabrication We first prepared commercial 2.5-μm-thick SiO 2  on Si wafers and baked them with air plasma for the surface treatment. Graphite flakes were transferred to the SiO 2 /Si substrate by mechanical exfoliation using Scotch Tape. We used electron-beam lithography to pattern the Tesla valve profiles on the initial flake and deposited an Al thin film to mask them by electron beam physical vapour deposition. We then used O 2  plasma to etch the exposed flake in a reactive ion etching system and the designed structures were obtained after the removal of the top Al thin film. In the centres of the two symmetrical Tesla valves, we deposited 70-nm Au pads as transducers for performing the thermoreflectance measurements in both the forward and reverse structures. Finally, the graphite Tesla valves were suspended by the Au pads deposited on both sides of the structures in combination with the underlying SiO 2  etching using vapour-phase hydrofluoric acid. Sample characterization We performed EBSD analysis on the entire 50 × 150-μm 2  flake (Extended Data Fig.  1a ) to investigate the crystallinity of our graphite samples. As shown in Extended Data Fig.  1b , the flake was irradiated with the electron beam at a tilted angle of 70° to the wafer. The electron diffraction pattern recorded the information of each crystal plane. The inverse pole maps (Extended Data Fig.  1c–e ) show the consistency of crystal orientation (identical colour) for all three directions, namely, the normal direction, the transverse direction and the reference direction. As a result, we confirmed that the graphite samples used in this work are single crystalline. In-plane quasi-ballistic thermal conduction in materials with a hexagonal lattice is reported to be dependent on the different lattice orientations of armchair and zigzag 53 . To exclude this effect, we fabricated our samples on the single-crystalline graphite flake so that the main and the bent channels in the forward structure are parallel (or have 180° symmetry) to their counterparts in the reverse case and identical lattice orientation for both cases. Secondary ion mass spectrometry was used to identify the isotopic composition of the single-crystalline graphite samples. After isotope enrichment using the high-pressure/high-temperature method 54 , 55 , our graphite crystals are composed of 99.98%  12 C and 0.02%  13 C, which are the world-class purified graphite samples. Investigation of the effect of terminal geometry in the graphite Tesla valve design To realize the reversal of heat flow in our Tesla valve, we separately designed the forward and reverse structures by rotating one by 180° to the other. We fabricated mirror-symmetry geometry of both structures suitable for the symmetric heat dissipation in the pump–probe measurement. This results in resistances at the source/sink for the forward/reverse directions being not strictly the same. However, in designing our samples, we considered this difference and found its impact to be negligible. First, we conducted both Monte Carlo and FEM simulations in simplified geometry, without the arm of the Tesla valve (that is, the bent channel). These simulations aim to examine the impact of geometry difference at the source and the sink. Extended Data Fig.  3  shows that phonon travel times (in Monte Carlo) are the same in both samples, as well as the decay times (in FEM). In other words, in both ballistic and diffusive views of phonon transport, slight differences in geometry at the source and the sink do not make an observable difference. Furthermore, the impact of contact sizes is smoothed out by the non-mathematically perfect heat source and sink areas. Indeed, in a theoretical system with a constant heat sink temperature at the ends of the bridge, contact areas would play an important role. But in the real experimental system, the heat source area is slowly heated up with a Gaussian laser beam to saturation, whereas the heat sink is a large conductive area that is far from a perfect isothermal boundary. Thus, the specific shape of the contact is less important. This is easy to see in the following FEM simulation, in which we changed the width of a graphite connector to the heat sink, as shown in Extended Data Fig.  8 . Although the constriction should have had a stronger impact, we can notice a difference in the decay curves only if we sweep the width parameter ( W ) in a much wider range than in our experimental samples. μ-TDTR measurement We used a non-contact, time-domain thermoreflectance method to analyse the thermal transport properties of our samples. A laser at 642 nm was pulsed with a duration of 2 μs to periodically pump heat through the Au transducer to the Tesla valve structures. A continuous-wave laser at 514 nm was used to investigate the change in reflectance (Δ R ) on the metal transducer during heat dissipation. The variation of reflectance (Δ R ) on the Au transducer was detected using the continuous-wave (probe) laser, which is equivalent to the variation of temperature by means of the coefficient of thermoreflectance ( C th ), that is, Δ R / R  =  C th Δ T . The TDTR signal thus shows the intrinsic decay of the heat injected by the pulsed (pump) laser through the Tesla valve structures in the microsecond range, as shown in Fig.  1c . For each measurement, the LabVIEW program fitted the decay curves with an exponential relation, ~exp(− t / τ ), and collected the last 200 thermal decay times ( τ ). The corresponding  τ  in each measurement was taken from the mean of its Gaussian distribution, as shown in Fig.  1d . Before the measurement at each temperature, we spent sufficient time for the temperature stabilization with an uncertainty of <0.1 K to ensure thermal equilibrium between the sample and the holder in the cryostat. Moreover, the decay time and the thermal conductivity were experimentally verified to be independent of the probe laser power heating, even with a more than doubled laser intensity (Extended Data Fig.  9 ). We assume that the thermal conductivity is also reasonably expected to be independent of the pump laser power, which only induces temporal heat pulse and is more experimentally difficult to be precisely characterized. At each given temperature, we moved the lasers back and forth on the forward and reverse structures and performed repeated measurements up to ten times for each structure (forward or reverse) and the error bars shown in the plots were calculated from their standard deviations. Thermal conductivity extraction In the μ-TDTR measurement, we first quantify the heat dissipation through the sample by means of the thermal decay time,  τ . The thermal conductivity of the Tesla valve is then extracted using FEM simulation implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics. To reproduce the experiment, we built 3D models with the same geometries as the measured Tesla valve in forward and reverse directions, as shown in Extended Data Fig.  10 . The pump laser centred on the gold transducer in the experiment is simulated by a Gaussian pulse heat source with the same pulse duration of 2 μs. We set the boundary condition of the heat sinks at the cryostat temperature. And the boundary condition of the edges of the Tesla valve structure is considered adiabatic, at which the thermal radiation loss of the suspended structure was estimated by the Stefan–Boltzmann law and concluded to be neglected, as well as the convection effect 56 , 57 . Heat conduction through the entire model follows the heat diffusion equation: $$\rho {C}_{{\rm{p}}}\frac{{\rm{\partial }}T}{{\rm{\partial }}t}+{\rm{\nabla }}\cdot (\,-\kappa {\rm{\nabla }}T)=0,$$                      (1)                  in which  ρ  is the density,  C p  is the heat capacity at constant pressure and  κ  is the thermal conductivity. These parameters are taken from the corresponding material values for the temperature of interest 58 , 59 . Thermal boundary conductance between the metal transducer and graphite has a negligible effect on our simulation results, as was investigated in our previous work 10 . We also consider the anisotropic thermal property in graphite by including the out-of-plane thermal conductivity from the literature 59 . Thus, the in-plane thermal conductivity of the Tesla valve structure is the only fitting parameter in the simulation. For instance, by sweeping a series of thermal conductivities of the graphite Tesla valve in the forward direction at 45 K, we obtain their corresponding decay curves, as plotted in Fig.  1c . Therefore, the corresponding thermal conductivity value can be obtained through the decay curve that fits our experimental data the best. At 300 K, we obtained the thermal conductivity for the graphite Tesla valve comparable with the literature values. Our values are between those of the bulk graphite 59  and the 1.2-μm-wide graphite ribbon with the same isotope contents 60 , as shown in Extended Data Fig.  6b . As the temperature decreases, these values are much lower than that of the bulk owing to the stronger size effects from the microscale geometry. Monte Carlo simulations Our Monte Carlo algorithm traces phonon wave packets through the three-dimensional model of the structure that is assumed to be at temperature  T . The phonons are emitted at the hot side and absorbed at the cold side. The phonon frequency ( ω ) and group velocities are obtained from the Planck distribution at the given temperature and phonon dispersion 61 . The dispersion was assumed to be isotropic and consisted of three acoustic branches. The temperature variations in the structure are assumed to be too small to cause substantial shift of the Planck distribution. The Umklapp scattering events are simulated as scattering in a random direction that occurs once the time since the previous diffuse scattering event exceeds time  t  = −ln( r ) τ R , in which  r  is a random value between zero and one and  τ R  is the relaxation time.

Tesla is expected to unveil a robotaxi tonight: 5 things to know - NPR,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQZXg5eFBBQXlTTmpWR21oR28xTVZpX1NDdkJYNnAxNFNzNTlNeFVKTWlZQkRITzdzLWlLanRkeUdVWlRKTzdWU2tjUEFsaWdXRFp4MjJ0Z1RTczQ3c2dvNnBIQUxWOEoxa2lpamxzbHZlVVJYdDZUTlJpeW1nTE1zRTlLYmowM3lNcWg0Rg?oc=5,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla CEO Elon Musk gestures at the Tenth Breakthrough Prize Ceremony at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, California, on April 13, 2024. Tesla is hosting an event it's calling ""We, Robot"" in Hollywood on Thursday night.

It's a scene straight out of Hollywood. And that's exactly where it's going to happen tonight — on a Warner Brothers studio in Burbank, California.   Tesla is calling the event ""We, Robot."" At 7 p.m. Pacific time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is expected to unveil the company's design for a dedicated robotaxi, a Tesla designed exclusively to ferry passengers without a driver — a feat the company's semi-autonomous software has not yet demonstrated it can do.   ""The future will be streamed live,"" the company  posted on X , the social media platform Musk owns.   Here are 5 things to know about Tesla's big bet on autonomous driving.   Musk says robotaxis are key to Tesla's future profits   Tesla makes money selling electric vehicles — in fact, its profit margins on its cars, which are consistently in the double digits, are enviable for an automaker. But Musk has his eye on the much fatter profit margins of the software industry.   In addition to selling cars, Tesla sells an expensive software package called ""Full Self Driving (Supervised)."" It can autonomously direct a Tesla on a wide range of roads, and navigate stoplights, stop signs and pedestrians without human input … most of the time. But it periodically requires a human to take over, which means it's not truly autonomous.   Musk has always maintained that demand for the software will be much higher when it is fully autonomous — in part because that would allow people to make money off their personal vehicles by lending them out, like a driverless Uber or Lyft.   ""The value of a fully electric autonomous fleet is generally gigantic — boggles the mind, really."" he told investors in 2021. ""That will be one of the most valuable things that's ever done in the history of civilization.""   A custom-built vehicle  just  for robotaxi rides is a relatively new twist on Musk's vision. Expect to hear more about it on Thursday.   He's promised they're coming next year — for years   Musk's become infamous for his overly enthusiastic estimates of how soon Tesla robotaxis will arrive. He's even taken to poking fun at himself for all the times he's been wrong.   Musk in 2019: ""Next year for sure we will have over a million robotaxis on the road.""  Musk in 2020: ""I think we could see robotaxis in operation … next year. Not in all markets, but in some.""  In 2021: ""I'm highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year.""  In 2022: I would be shocked if we do not achieve full self-driving safer-than-human this year.""  2023: ""Now, I know I'm the boy who cried [Full-Self-Driving], but man, I think — I think we'll be better than human by the end of this year."" And this summer: ""Obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. … Next year seems highly probable to me.""    The problem is that while Tesla's software can drive a vehicle without human help  much  of the time, it's not yet reliable enough to drive unassisted  all  of the time.   Companies like Alphabet's Waymo and GM's Cruise, meanwhile, have already sent driverless taxis onto streets — although Cruise put human ""safety drivers"" back behind the wheel after a  crash last year.  The systems often have someone on call to  assist remotely  if a car gets stuck. But that's a far cry from needing constant oversight: According to data it supplied the state of California, Waymo drove nearly 1.2 million fully driverless miles last year with a total of 14 ""disengagements,"" or times the software required manual control.   Even for those companies, robotaxis aren't profitable yet. The auto market research giant J.D. Power recently surveyed people who have ridden in robotaxis and found that while passengers generally liked the experience, they don't find the taxis practical. Until they're cheaper and cover more ground, the pollsters concluded, ""the service will remain a novelty transportation method.""   Tesla's approach to autonomy is unusual — and controversial   So if robotaxis already exist, why doesn't Tesla have this tech yet? There's a big difference between how other companies — like Waymo, Cruise, the driverless trucking company Aurora and a host of startups — approach autonomy, and how Tesla is trying to do it.   Musk decided to build a system based only on relatively cheap cameras, with no other inputs; other companies also use radar and other pricey high-tech sensors. Musk also has embraced ""end-to-end learning,"" where the artificial intelligence ""learns"" how to drive from raw data; other companies add human-designed rules and guardrails to their AI systems.   Analyst George Gianarikas of Canaccord Genuity Group notes that Musk's approach requires billions of dollars of upfront investment in AI, but much cheaper hardware on vehicles. That's a combination that is expensive now, but would pay off if there were, say, millions of robotaxis on the road.   Musk is adamant that Tesla's approach is superior. ""Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets"" — that is, human brains — ""and eyes, so naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution,"" Musk told investors earlier this year. Tesla also has enormous amounts of driving data from its vehicles on the road today.   Other companies say this approach is not just wrong but dangerous. Aurora took the unusual step of preemptively emailing reporters ahead of Tesla's event this week to share bullet points about exactly what they object to. Those included concerns about making sure a system is learning good driving behaviors — not bad ones, like running stop signs — and that there are systems of checks and balances.   Aurora's email paraphrases points CPO Sterling Anderson made in a  recent webcast : the approach favored by Tesla, the summary notes, is a "" 'train and pray' approach where you fix a problem by throwing more data at the system – we find this to be problematic in a safety critical industry where you need confidence and proof you've actually fixed.""   Anderson used to work at Tesla, where he helped launch Tesla's Autopilot software, its first partial-automation system, the Aurora email notes. Waymo  just snagged  a former Tesla exec for its team, too.   One wild card: What will regulators think?   The United States still has no federal laws governing self-driving, so a patchwork of state and city regulators set the boundaries of what companies can and cannot do.   Musk has always acknowledged that achieving full self-driving is not just a matter of technological innovation; if regulators aren't convinced a robotaxi fleet is safe, it isn't going anywhere.   That has implications for the physical design of vehicles. Cruise recently abandoned plans for a futuristic robotaxi vehicle with no steering wheel, returning to a more conventional design that a human  could  operate, primarily to reduce the risk of running afoul of regulators.   And governmental concerns could also affect software. Gianarikas says regulators who dig into the coding of a system built by ""end-to-end"" deep learning might not like what they find.   ""You can imagine a scenario where [regulators] just kind of have this moment, like 'What? You don't … have any hard-coded software rules?"" he says. ""'How do you control it?'""   Still, Gianarikas notes that while there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about a Tesla robotaxi fleet, Elon Musk has a track record of eventually proving skeptics wrong.   The reveal might include another kind of robot   The event's name — ""We, Robot"" — is a nod to a classic Isaac Asimov short story collection exploring the ethical and psychological implications of building increasingly human-like robots. It's also the title of a very vaguely related Will Smith action movie.                            Visitors look at Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus at its exhibition booth during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai on July 5, 2024. Optimus, a featureless humanoid robot, can walk and fold laundry. Musk has argued it could eventually learn to do almost anything a human can do.                                                            Stringer/AFP via Getty Images                                         hide caption       toggle caption                       Stringer/AFP via Getty Images                     That hints at the possibility that, in addition to a robotaxi, the reveal could feature Optimus, the humanoid robot Tesla has been developing as an autonomous laborer capable of doing repetitive tasks.   ""I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else at Tesla combined,"" Musk told investors this summer. ""A humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you asked of it. … I think everyone on Earth is going to want one.""   Optimus, a black and white robot with a featureless face of smooth black glass, can walk — in a stilted, gliding sort of way. Tesla has  shared videos  of it  sorting objects , standing on one leg and  dancing .   Dan Ives, an analyst and a long-time Tesla bull, will be in attendance on Thursday night. He's less interested in androids and more in whether Musk can demonstrate a fully autonomous vehicle that actually works.   ""This needs to be a jaw-dropper type of event,"" he said — hype and promises are not going to cut it.   ""Billi"

The closely watched gross margin came in at  19.8% , way ahead of expectations for a print of  16.8% , as investors get over the fact that revenue from actually selling cars has slipped into neutral, rising just over  1%  in the last year. Externally, the company is increasingly billing itself as anything but a car company, with robotaxis and humanoids key to its future ( maybe ). But, while those didn’t have any explicit impact on the company’s actual numbers this quarter, what  is  firing on all cylinders is the company’s energy-generation and storage business, which reported growth north of  50% , by far the best of Tesla’s divisions. Not only is the energy-generation and storage business growing rapidly, but on a relative basis it’s also significantly more profitable for Tesla than selling cars: the company reported a  31% gross profit margin  from its energy efforts, nearly double the  16%  from automotive sales. It’s worth noting, of course, that nothing beats the  $739 million  worth of pure profit from automotive regulatory credits. The company’s energy business ranges from  Megapack , a product aimed at large-scale utilities deployment, to products geared for end customers in smaller households like the  Tesla Powerwall , and it also sells and installs solar-power systems.  Sherwood News Demand for Tesla’s energy-storage solutions is expected to only expand, especially with  growing installations  of renewable-energy sources like wind and solar, which can be volatile and require battery solutions to store the excess energy when its not blowing hard enough or sunny enough. The outlook for EV charging services like Tesla’s Supercharger is also bright, with America’s EV infrastructure  struggling  to meet demands and the ambitious roadmap to 2030. CEO Elon Musk also said on  an earnings call  that car sales would likely get back to growth next year, predicting that Tesla’s deliveries could rise  20% to 30%  next year. Of course, many Elon Musk predictions haven’t come true."

With the big  “We, Robot” Tesla event  the other day, I couldn’t help returning to something from 5 years ago. It is a mixture of frustrating, hilarious, and essentially fraudulent.   “We, Robot” could have taken place 5–8 years ago, because the core points were presented back then. One of the same comparisons was made back then — the comparison to elevator operators. Tesla vehicles could have driven by themselves around a Warner Bros. fake downtown back then as well — it would just be the Model 3, S, and X that would have been used. And, importantly, Elon Musk proclaimed with great enthusiasm that Tesla cars bought back in 2018 and 2019 would be  appreciating assets —  because they were going to be able to make their owners money as robotaxis within a couple of years.   I bought my 2019 Tesla Model 3 in mid-2019, with the latest notes from Musk at the time being that feature-complete Full Self Driving would be complete by the end of the year. Depending on software progress and regulatory approval, I might have a robotaxi on my hands in a year or two. (It was not shared until much later that it was around this same time that Tesla decided it needed to do a complete rewrite and tackle the problem from a different angle.)   It’s now more than 5 years later. Many Teslas sold at that time are no longer with their original owners — either sold on or destroyed in accidents. I still have mine, but, shockingly, it has  not  appreciated in value. In fact, it’s worth well below 50% of what I bought it for.   Here’s the thing: the timeframes for achieving robotaxi capability presented at “We, Robot” are basically the same as the timeframes presented by Elon Musk  at a similar presentation in 2018  — relative to the time of the presentation. In other words, the same promises are being made right now as were made several years ago. But what happened to those earlier promises? I almost feel like I’m in some kind of Marvel timewarp or mass brainwashing. We are getting the same pitch, 5 years later, but the pitch from 5 years ago clearly never came true.   Rather than being told that cars bought at the time of that first presentation will, finally, become appreciating assets any day now, the hype is around a new Cybercab design to be built in 2027. But, wait, when will my 2019 Model 3 finally be worth more than I bought it for?   I know some think this is a personal gripe. If it was only that, I’d take it up with Tesla management. The point is that millions of people have bought Teslas following these promises and based off of them, and I have a hard time believing anyone who bought a Tesla in the past 5 years is going to see their Tesla appreciate in value. That’s what the new cyber vehicles are for — to distract people from the previous presentation, hype, and promise.   I honestly am quite surprised there haven’t been class action lawsuits filed at this point.  These are slides  used in the 2018 presentation:               There were some new elements in this presentation, though, compared to 5–8 years ago. Musk discussed the humanoid robot they are developing, noting both that he thinks one will cost $20,000–30,000 long term, once it’s produced at scale, and that he thinks “this will be the biggest product ever of any kind.” He thinks something at that price that is not essential to a working class person’s life will become the biggest product ever. I’m at a loss for words.     Did Elon throw a good party? Yes, for sure. Dancing robots in a gazebo with “What Is Love?” playing, cool-looking futuristic Cybercabs and Cybervans driving people around a pretty Hollywood townscape: fun. Would have been nice to be a part of the party. But it feels like a giant Hollywood smokescreen to distract from the fact that the same promises were made 5+ years ago, and no one who bought a car at that time — or probably since then — bought an appreciating asset.   Again,  maybe I have become too skeptical and will be proven wrong . That would be great. However, it is already half a decade since these forecasts — about customer cars produced at that time — began.

Last Updated on:  1st November 2024, 12:52 am    After  my 5-year anniversary article , here’s an addendum.   Figure 1: The Future and The Past. Elizabeth and Tesla Model 3 in front of settlers’ dugout homes and barn. Castle Valley, Utah. November 17, 2019. Photo by Fritz Hasler.   Soon after my 5-year anniversary,  Tesla notified me that my 12-volt battery needed to be replaced . This is not the drive battery, but the small battery needed to boot up the car and run accessories. There were veiled threats: I could no longer install software updates and who knows what else wouldn’t be working. I scheduled an appointment on Friday and a mobile service technician was at my driveway in Lindon, Utah, bright and early Monday morning.   I had left the frunk unlatched, which he opened, and then he opened a compartment towards the wind screen, took out my old battery, and installed a new one. Figure 2 shows the red 12-volt battery in the frunk of a Tesla Model 3. The battery was on the small size compared to the big battery for the V8 engine on my ski boat. I asked the service technician whether I could have done it myself. He said that would not be a good idea and relayed the story about someone who had changed his own 12V battery and fried the $15,000 drive battery. I also asked him whether the repair notification came because I was at my 5-year anniversary or whether it had detected poor performance of my battery. He said it was the latter.   The good part: the cost was only $120 including labor.   Figure 2: Red 12V battery. Tesla Motor Club image.   I had been ignoring my wife’s complaints that the controls on her electric seat weren’t working . One of the knobs had broken. I had only added this to my service request at the last minute and the repair technician said he didn’t know if he had the correct part to fix it. He tried a few knobs, none of which worked, and he said I would have to schedule another appointment. The appointment was to be the following Friday, but we are on travel, so we will have to wait at this point to reschedule.   The bad part: the cost will be $160 when I have this done. This seems like a lot for a broken knob.   FSD 12.5.4.1 Fails   I’ve been driving with Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) Beta, now “Supervised,” for 2.5 years. Over this period, I have received 10+ software updates. Changes from some of the updates were insignificant, However the rest of the updates gave me significant improvements in performance. However, that changed  with Full Self Driving Supervised 12.5.4.1. For the first time I’m finding the performance significantly worse under some conditions.  In fact, I’ve found some circumstances where it is driving me crazy. The software still performs very well at highway speeds and making turns on city streets. However, at intermediate speeds on winding roads, it’s totally nuts. It no longer tells you the speed you have set, it just says MAX. Coming down very winding Provo Canyon from Heber to Orem, Utah, I like to reduce the requested speed to the speed limit of 50 mph or even 45 mph so that I can relax and let FSD automatically drive me down the Canyon with no worries. I’ve found FSD Supervised 12.5.4.1 bringing me down at 65 or 70 mph, and it couldn’t stay on track on the curves at that speed. I tried to lower the speed but it wouldn’t let me do it. I found this much too fast to come down the canyon safely. Finally, I disengaged FSD and drove down the canyon with only Autosteer, which would let me set any speed I wanted.   Please, Tesla, always let me set the speed I want again, and tell me what I have set, not just MAX. Do this at every speed not just at highway speeds!     Furthermore, FSD Supervised 12.5.4.1 no longer keeps me centered perfectly in my lane, I find my car drifting both right and left. To the left I once hit the rumble strip in the center of the road, and to the right I’ve actually drifted off onto the gravel and one time grazed a curb. The Autosteer performance is worse — are you kidding me?????? Under some conditions, I don’t trust it anymore.   FSD Supervised 12.5.4.1 also has a strong bias to the right. Merging onto a freeway, it hugs the right lane until the lane finally joins the main highway. Only then will it finally center itself in the proper lane.   FSD Supervised 12.5.4.1’s right bias often has me in a right turn lane instead of the main center lane required for going straight as specified by the navigation. I’ve seen this problem before, but the most recent software updates (before this) had reduced or eliminated this problem.   However, one of the best new features of FSD Supervised 12.5.4.1 is that it no longer requires tugging at the steering wheel  to let the system know you are paying attention to the road. The camera above the mirror watching your head and eyes does that function very well.  But when reducing the level of automation from FSD to Autosteer, you are back to tugging at the steering wheel . Keeping all these different modes straight is driving me crazy. Before I knew it, I had failed to tug on the steering wheel enough and received two forced disengagements. Three more and I will lose access to FSD and Autosteer for 7 days.     Why We Still Love Our Model 3 after 5 years & 139,993 miles   We love the incredible acceleration of our dual-motor Tesla Model 3. It’s smooth as silk and far exceeds any car we’ve owned in the past 70 years. Following a slow truck on a two-lane road, you only need 100 yards to pass. Full Self Driving is a joy except on windy roads. The navigation system is also amazing, where a voice command will take you to nearly any address or business you ask for. The sound system with a couple subwoofers is marvelous, and you can give it voice commands to play nearly any song you can think of. Alternatively, it will play from your playlist on your phone when driving through Wyoming with no cell connection. The two electric seats are great and the driver’s seat will automatically retract and raise up to any setting you choose when you get out. When you get back in it automatically returns the driver’s seat, steering wheel, and mirror settings to the driver’s preference.   However, the suspension is very stiff and gives you a jolt with every bump in the road. If the road is recently resurfaced and smooth, it’s no problem, but if the road is old and bumpy, you feel it. I understand that the new Model 3 refresh has addressed this problem.   Referral Program:   If you are buying a new Tesla, Tesla has reactivated its referral program.

Tesla set to unveil its Cybercab in move Musk hopes will steer company into new era - ABC News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQcGpESzRqbXlEajdBNUdGcUtSay1RWG1NSXhKMGpicXdOZm1ZRXBnUVJybW9KdDJMMUJrWHlyb0VSajdQSm1GVkd4bXJDb0dsMWhrbGZFZmlvX2xiV3B2NDJVT2Y2d0xqM1JhT3lPbWV3S1hYdHhTUk5SckdPS25WdTNyT0s3VWVQaFg0Q0FKXzM4V0doVll5TWtBTjdQbEnSAaQBQVVfeXFMTk4wVGlHbXU5Yk1ZZ1VKa2xoMXdoWmFaV04tNmFneExoOTZxenRnNVlTWTl1Y1hPbGhVN0xQandXZzVXeUZjYlBHM3ZSQ0xNNTlhR3pLb2h0ejNOS3JjZnYzbEw5cVdoaWdhZTVBQWdWTHZfcUQtNS0zNkFaYnlSYld5SGJZaVYxdzNzSDE4dDdOM2doWWxxTFNmRUgtWTZhRE9ZOG0?oc=5,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla is set to hold a live event Thursday titled “We, Robot” where the company is expected to unveil a fully autonomous vehicle that CEO Elon Musk has called a “Cybercab.” A self-driving taxi that can collect passengers and drive them to their destinations safely is an idea Musk has been toying with for several years. Some analysts say if the new robotaxi works, it could vault the electric vehicle company into a new era of automotive innovation. Still, many critics are skeptical Tesla can sell safe, driverless cars at scale due to the numerous state and federal safety regulations it faces over its current driver-assistance technology. But Musk himself is confident, posting on X --- the social network he owns --- that “this will be one for the history books.” “We, Robot,” was originally scheduled for Aug. 8, but was pushed back after Musk asked for an “important design change” to the vehicle. In a post on X, a link to the event’s livestream is captioned: “[t]he future will be streamed live.” Here’s what to expect from Tesla’s robotaxi event: Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, speaks during a Starship update press conference, Feb. 10, 2022, at a SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas. Jon Shapley/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images A Hollywood Production “We, Robot” is set to kick off at the Warner Bros. Discovery movie studio backlot in Burbank, California, at 7 p.m. It’s the place where blockbuster movies like “Batman” and TV shows like “Friends” were filmed. “We’re talking about literal Hollywood here,” says Patrick George, editor in chief of InsideEVs. The lot contains plenty of space, prompting some to speculate that it will be used to demonstrate the car’s self-driving capabilities in real time. But it’s far from representative of a real-world driving environment, and that’s cause for skepticism, says George. “I have to wonder how authentic it is. Like, if Tesla had really cracked fully self-driving cars, why not do this demonstration in downtown Austin, where they’re located, which is also choked with traffic, or downtown Los Angeles?” he tells ABC Audio. The “Cybercab” Musk says the Cybercab would operate similarly to a traditional taxi service. Instead of drivers, the cars will be autonomous, and what’s more, Tesla owners will be allowed to send their own cars off to collect fares when they’re not using their vehicles. In June, at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, dubbed “Cyber Roundup 2024,” Musk said that his vision for a driverless taxi service is similar to Uber, the ridesharing service, and AirBnB, the vacation rental app. “So, like, they’ll be some cars that Tesla owns itself, in kind of an Uber fashion. But then for the fleet that is owned by our customers, there will be like an AirBnB thing,” Musk told investors. “You can add or subtract your car to the fleet whenever you want.” “It almost sounds like an Uber-type application,” says George, “that would allow these specialized vehicles or, who knows, maybe even passenger Teslas, to operate on this robotaxi network.” But even ahead of Thursday night’s event, Musk’s claims have caused figures in the rideshare industry to raise their eyebrows. In a podcast interview earlier this year with venture capital investor Logan Bartlett, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed skepticism that a “Tesla owner or owner of any other car is going to want to have that car be ridden in by a complete stranger.” An employee drives a Tesla Motors Inc. Model S electric automobile, equipped with Autopilot hardware and software, hands-free on a highway in Amsterdam, Oct. 26, 2015. Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg via Getty Images Wedbush Securities Tech Analyst Dan Ives says Musk is hoping the Cybercab can achieve two goals. First, the data collected from autonomous taxi rides could lay the groundwork for other projects he’s working on, such as the humanoid Tesla robot dubbed “Optimus.” In addition, Ives says, Musk is also aiming to create a durable revenue stream from rideshares so the company doesn’t have to rely on people buying new cars every year. “It's not just selling a car and the margins they meet there. It's about software, full self-driving, autonomous and ultimately their views from a data perspective that will ultimately drive robotics, Optimus, and other technology.” “That’s where he sees everything going, that’s what he thinks will turn Tesla into a multitrillion-dollar company, and I think power the many other ventures that he has running,” says George. Tesla’s Bumpy Autonomous Past Tesla currently offers semi-autonomous driving technology, called “Autopilot,” which can keep the car centered in its lane, as well as speed up and slow down with highway traffic. In addition, Tesla buyers can opt for the $8,000 “Full Self Driving” option, which is designed for lower speed urban driving. The company claims Full Self Driving makes the car “able to drive itself almost anywhere with minimal driver intervention,” but also stipulates that the feature “require[s] active driver supervision and do[es] not make the vehicle autonomous.” “It still requires a human minder, a human operator. Like, it’s not really full self-driving,” says George. A Tesla all electric Model X is displayed during the British Motor Show 2024 at Farnborough International Exhibition Centre, Aug. 15, 2024, in Farnborough, England. John Keeble/Getty Images Earlier this year, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of more than 900 crashes in which Autopilot is thought to have been engaged, found that the system likely contributed to 467 of them, resulting in 13 deaths. NHTSA is also investigating whether a massive recall of nearly every Tesla ever made went far enough in addressing the safety of Autopilot. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about NHTSA's findings. “This all speaks to what a risky bet this is for Tesla,” says George. “They’re kind of going all in on a very unproven technology and are making very clear that’s what they see the future as. And they’ve got to deliver.” The financial stakes Earlier this month, Tesla posted better-than-expected third quarter earnings. The company said it delivered nearly 463,000 vehicles globally in Q3, up from just over 435,000 during the same period last year. Still, shares slumped on the news, as investors eye Tesla’s shrinking market share amid increasingly competitive electric vehicles from other automakers. George says that’s why the stakes are high for Tesla ahead of the robotaxi event. “It may also be possible that this is less about selling a product to future owners, and more about convincing Wall Street that he’s on the right track to keep Tesla’s stock price high,” says George, adding, “they’ve been kind of alluding to this as being right around the corner for 10 years now, and I think that more and more we’re starting to see that that check is due.” [ ]"
"Elon Musk Says A $25,000 Tesla ‘Would Be Silly’ And ‘Pointless’ - The Autopian",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNN2NhalkzNGQ4ZW0xV1ZzRFFyVHRHMlZqcVRIeXdtemRETDRGdUJBNW5UdWVVTjVMTDNaV01EWnNuXzNJdl9zVG1NM2stNGplRzJ2LXBnWnZCU1pVbVBoWjg2WEFMLThFOEJZZEhudjJYT1ZOWEl4VEs2OTJCNWFQdVV6V1ZWS21tTUNRU3prWQ?oc=5,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla released its third-quarter financials yesterday and, as is often the case with Tesla, the results were inverted from what people expected with margins coming in better and revenue coming in lower. CEO Elon Musk also made it extremely clear that a $25,000 affordable car with a steering wheel ain’t happening.   It’s been a while since we’ve kicked off a Morning Dump with Tesla and I feel like poor Carlos Tavares, not pictured above, probably needs a break. While Tesla will likely be the biggest mover among automotive stocks today, don’t sleep on Renault, which also posted a strong Q3 performance.     The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   You know who didn’t perform well? Graham Rahal. The IndyCar driver had a bad season this year, failing to deliver a championship to his team. His company, Graham Rahal Performance LLC, also failed to deliver a $1.2 million car to a customer and now he’s getting sued.   Also on the back row, at least when it comes to electrification, is Stellantis. Will a solid-state battery help the automaker achieve  Alex Palou -type performance?   A $25,000 Car ‘Would Be Completely At Odds With What Believe’ Says Musk   Source: Tesla Motors   Every quarter Tesla’s Elon Musk comes out and makes it clear that his car company is really an autonomous driving company and that all of this talk of cars is kinda silly. After the Q1 financials were released, I wrote: “ Elon Musk Clearly Doesn’t Want To Be CEO Of A ‘Car Company’ Anymore .” My Q2 wrap-up was: “ Elon Musk Sounds Bummed Tesla Still Has To Make Cars. ” Are you sensing a pattern?   Elon Musk keeps telling investors and reporters that the company is not really a car company and focusing on it being a car company is stupid. Over and over again Musk tells people this and, yet, the first questions investors wanted to ask last night were about the $25,000 car.   I’ll get to that, but first some context. Yesterday, Tesla  released its Q3 numbers  and they were  sort of the opposite of what the market had expected , which is probably why the stock is going up today. Here’s what I wrote yesterday:   Tesla will report its third-quarter financials later today and  the expectation  is that the company will remain profitable, albeit with lower margins due to the incentives being pushed to sell cars.   Nope!   Revenue was  expected to reach $25.6 billio n and non-GAAP earnings were predicted to hit $0.60 per share. Instead, revenue came in slightly lower at $25.2 billion, but non-GAAP earnings were way up at $0.72 per share. The reason? Gross automotive margins were up to 17.1% excluding carbon credits, and higher if you include those credits.   How did the company do it?   Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at ~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation.   While I suspect there are numerous factors that contributed to this, Tesla  laid off a ton of people this quarter . Is this related to the issue Tesla customers are having with service? Musk, in the  Q3 earnings call , kinda dodged this by saying that the goal is to not need any service because “The car doesn’t break.” That’s a good goal, albeit a difficult one.   Musk also adds that:   Sustaining these margins in Q4, however, will be challenging, given the current economic environment. Note that we are focused on the cost per vehicle, and there are numerous work streams within the company to squeeze out cost without compromising on customer experience.   You can only pull the “we fired a bunch of people” trick so many times so we’ll see how it pans out next quarter.   Still, the numbers are impressive and, as mentioned yesterday, no other major automaker outside of China seems to be able to come close. You’d think this would mean that Tesla could be the first Western automaker to crack the $25,000 car, but Elon Musk doesn’t want to do that. Here’s what he said in that same call:   So, I think we’ve made very clear that we’re — the future is autonomous. I mean, it’s going to be — I’ve actually said this many years ago, but that in my strong belief and I believe that is panning out to be true, very obvious retrospect is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles. And nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse and using a foot bone. It’s not that there are no horses.   Yes, there are some but they’re unusual. They’re niche. And so, everything is going to be electric autonomous. I think this is like it should be, frankly, blindingly obvious at this point, that is the future.   So, a lot of automotive companies, most of the companies have not internalized this, which is surprising because we’re shouting from the rooftops for such a long time.   Maybe he’s right? If Tesla can achieve a highly accurate self-driving EV that costs under $30k using only cameras and AI that you can rent out when you’re not using it then this might reduce the need for regular cars. I don’t understand the bit about the foot bone, though. Does he mean no one will ever need to walk again? Someone please explain this to me.   In light of that, producing a $25,000 car just seems like a waste of time:   So, anyway, basically, I think having a regular 25K model is pointless. It would be silly. Like it would be completely at odds with what we believe.   The regulatory hurdles of getting these cars out there when Waymo has fewer than 1,000 cars seem so high to me, though this does support my theory that part of what Musk wants out of a Trump administration is the  ability to release thousands of robotaxis . I can’t imagine the current government in Texas or a Trump admin stopping him.   Renault Also Had A Strong Quarter     In all the talk of  how screwed the European car industry is,  I’ve tended to ignore Renault because Renault is the odd case. Since its divorce from Nissan, Renault has managed to pump out some decent new products and meet the market where it is. Having less exposure to China helps, as does Renault’s ability to make cheap cars under its Dacia brand.   The company  put out its Q3 earnings report  and it looks pretty good to me. Revenues beat expectations at $11.6 billion for the quarter, up over last year in a challenging market. While sales were down, they were in line with the general trend, and the company has managed to maintain a reasonable margin.   Renault also benefits from having both hybrids and EVs, which accounted for 47% of the company’s sales this quarter  according to  Reuters . I’m excited about a lot of the new products, especially  the Renault 5 E-Tech . I also think a  Dacia Spring  or  Dacia Duster  would do well over here if Renault ever decided to bring cars to the United States.   It’s almost like making affordable cars is a good strategy!   Graham Rahal Sued For $1.2 Million Over Project ONE     It feels like we’ve all been waiting forever for the  F1-inspired AMG Project ONE  to reach production, but it’s probably gonna feel a lot longer if you were the person who asked race car driver Graham Rahal to secure you one.   Rahal’s side gig is the owner of a dealer/broker for high-end performance cars called Graham Rahal Performance LLC. This is separate from Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, his dad’s IndyCar team, although both are located on the same street.   According to a lawsuit, an individual gave $1.2 million to Rahal’s company in order to get a Project ONE and it’s never happened and now that individual wants the $1.2 million back. From  the  Indianapolis Star :   In the lawsuit, IRB says it and GRP committed to a purchase and allocation agreement for GRP to deliver a limited-edition Mercedes Project One, also known as a Mercedes AMG-One, in March 2019. Mercedes-Benz only planned to make 275 of that specific vehicle, according to the lawsuit, and IRB paid GRP $1.2 million of a deposit to secure the car and deliver it to the Montana-based company.   Over five years later, IRB says in the lawsuit that Graham Rahal’s company has not gotten the vehicle promised and has no plan to secure it at this time.   Rahal’s attorney denies any wrongdoing. Also, this appears to be  separate from the FBI raid at RLL’s offices last month . What the hell is going on in Zionsville?   Stellantis Will Do Us A Solid (State Battery)     Stellantis was the last major holdout in the EV space in North America and its only current electric product is the new Fiat 500, though  the Dodge Charger Daytona is coming . Having been slow to electrify, the company seems like it’s going to at least try and skip ahead of the current liquid lithium chemistries at some point and try to deploy solid-state batteries early.   The promise of solid-state batteries is that they’ll deliver twice the range for half the weight in a safer package that’s also easier to charge. As soon as 2026, Stellantis says it’ll have a fleet of Charger Daytonas with experimental solid-state batteries from its partner Factorial Inc.   Per  The Detroit News :   “This demonstration fleet is an important milestone in our partnership with Factorial,” said Ned Curic, Stellantis’ chief engineering and technology officer, in a statement. “By integrating Factorial’s innovative battery solution into the STLA Large platform (which the Charger is built on), we are validating its potential to enhance our electric vehicle lineup, ensuring customers benefit from improved performance, longer driving ranges and faster charging times in the coming years.”   It would be hilarious if Stellantis leap-frogged everyone, though that’s far from certain. Every car company is trying to get a solid-state battery to market before the end of the decade and it’s not clear who is capable of getting it right or that it’s even possible to produce solid-state batteries at a "

Tesla earnings: Wall Street weighs in following monster quarter - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxPQk9Va3BkODhPX3JCOEdzTnVJUHZUMFRydVA5TXQ0UHBZVHI1aWhTSVNwa010b2pnSXBFSWpQajRtZ1kyTUpFVmdadmVNaE5JampLVVpBVEFoV28wSkVNS2VWZGdFYUhmbmtHV0w1X1pOMmdfV3dpcV94bmRLVWJMVzczNWF2TzFzcGM0cklJUXNQdUlIdVB4YzY4OTE3dUVwWGpkeGV5QkgwaC1q?oc=5,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla ( TSLA ) stock rocketed higher on Thursday on the back of several positive disclosures from the EV maker in its third quarter report.   From a Q3 profit beat and improving margins to an improved growth outlook, cheap EV update, and robotaxi rollout, there's plenty for analysts to chew on for a company whose shares, even including today’s big move, are only up 2% for the year.   Bank of America’s John Murphy upped his price target on the back of Tesla’s strong quarter.   NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price   •   USD               At close: April 22 at 4:00:01 PM EDT       Pre-Market: 4:36:46 AM EDT     “We are raising our EPS estimates slightly due to improved gross margin in 3Q24 as a result of lower [raw material costs], Cybertruck ramp, execution/cost cutting, reg credits, and higher volume,” Murphy wrote in a note published Thursday morning.   Murphy was pleased to see auto gross margin strength, with Energy and Services (where Tesla sees sales doubling in 2025) tracking above estimates. As a result, Murphy hiked his price target to $265 from $255 and maintained the firm’s Buy rating.   Looking ahead, Murphy and BofA see a “well positioned” 2025, with a “second growth wave” on the horizon for Tesla.   “The bottom-line [from positive commentary on the earnings call] was that Tesla is charging up for the next wave of growth,” Murphy said. “[M]anagement's sees unit volumes to materially step up by 20-30% in 2025. This radical change is likely to be fueled by the expected production start of a more affordable vehicle in 1H25 (more likely 2H25) and the Cybercab.”       Murphy also noted that Tesla saw an uptick in full self-driving (FSD) adoption following the company's Oct. 10 Robotaxi event and positive developments with the 4680 battery, which he sees as “the most competitive battery in the US” in terms of cost level.   Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas homed in on CEO Elon Musk’s prediction that Tesla volume growth could hit 20% to 30% in 2025, which Musk caveated as a “best guess.”   Musk’s target “clearly depends on the company's ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers, and improved features,” Jonas wrote in a note to investors.   Morgan Stanley and Jonas are now projecting a 14% annual growth rate (2.07 mm units) for 2025, which would be taking the expected Q4 delivery total and annualizing it, equating to around 510,000 to 520,000 units delivered in Q4.   Jonas and the Morgan Stanley team see Tesla’s quarter as one that had investors focusing on lowering vehicle costs and growing the auto business profitability over trying to value Tesla’s shift to AI and other ventures. Tesla remains a “top pick” for Morgan Stanley, with a $310 price target.       Story Continues     Edison Yu of Deutsche Bank called Q3 margins “impressive” in both the auto and energy business and saw Q4 deliveries rising 11% sequentially, which would be a huge quarter-over-quarter move. Like other analysts, the 20% to 30% volume growth projected by Musk was “materially above our/consensus expectations,” with the cheaper EV supporting that growth with a launch in the first half of 2025. Combining that news with the incremental info on Cybercab and robotaxi testing “fueled more debate” on the merits of that business line going forward. “Our view continues to be that Tesla is well positioned as a technology platform to leverage end-to-end AI into a leading position in autonomous driving and humanoid robotics,"" Yu wrote, reiterating the firm's Buy rating and $295 price target. One of the most bullish Tesla analysts on the street, Dan Ives, was very impressed with Tesla’s quarter, which he dubbed an “early Christmas present” for investors. “I think it's margins, margins, margins,” Ives told Yahoo Finance, with that being the main driver behind Tesla’s monster stock move today. “Look at their cost of goods, their ability to produce cars is down ultimately 30% to 40%, and could be down another 20%, 30% when you look at next year … What we've seen on margins, the renaissance of growth now is I think heading into 2025.”   Tesla and SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk at a political festival Atreju organized by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy right-wing party in Rome, Italy, Dec. 16, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo)   ·   Reuters / Reuters Ives says that margin story merges with Tesla’s AI and autonomous offerings, as well as other growth drivers that will eventually lead to a trillion-dollar-plus market cap. “We could be in a Cybercab in the next two to three years, so we're not talking about something that's five, 10 years down the road. This is something that will over the coming years become a reality,” he said. Ives added, “This is going to be the next stage of growth, autonomous FSD, AI, but it comes down to you need the deliveries, you need the margins. They're checking every box.” Ives came away deeply impressed by the earnings conference call, claiming it was Musk and Tesla’s best in a number of years. Ives and Wedbush maintained their Tesla Outperform rating and $300 price target. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. You can follow him on  X  and on  Instagram .

Last Updated on:  14th October 2024, 10:51 pm    Scrolling through the  Washington Post  this week, I came upon a opinion piece by Matt Bai. He wrote that as Elon Musk lurches further and further toward the lunatic fringe on the political right — a few days ago he was positively giddy while on stage with Donald Trump in Pennsylvania — many Tesla owners are coming to regret buying their cars. If you go to Amazon, you can find a selection of bumper stickers with messages like “I bought this before Elon went crazy,” “Shut Up, Elon,” “Anti-Elon Tesla Club,” and a few that we can’t print here because this is a family friendly place.   Bai writes that many Tesla owners bought their cars in large part because they felt they were having a positive impact on the world. Here was a way to actually do something about carbon emissions, even if it meant a little extra inconvenience on road trips. Even when  Musk  decided to waste a chunk of his fortune on buying Twitter, so that he could restore accounts belonging to right wing dissemblers such as Donald Trump and Alex Jones, Tesla lovers managed to feel pretty good about themselves.   Since then, however, Musk has gone full MAGA. Among the highlights: he has endorsed the antisemitic “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, wondered why no one tries to assassinate the Democratic nominee for president, and pledged to give Trump’s campaign $45 million a month (although he seems to have hedged). This past weekend, Musk showed up at a Trump rally and reiterated his belief that the country and its Constitution could not continue to exist if Trump weren’t reelected.   Among Bai’s friends who drive a Tesla, Musk’s name comes up a lot in conversation, like an embarrassing skin condition you wish you could ignore, he says. Some manage to compartmentalize their feelings. A neighbor he sees at the dog park rails against Trump voters, but raves about his Model S. One woman he knows recently bought a Tesla Model 3, but knocked on doors for Harris twice last month.   Has Tesla Lost Its Allure?   Bai says he is now in the market for an electric car himself, and like many others, is conflicted about whether to get a Tesla. He has some advice for others in a similar position.   “If you already drive a Tesla, and someone gives you a hard time about it, tell them to keep it to themselves, or maybe just drive the car over their azaleas. We buy all kinds of things from companies whose owners would probably appall us if we had them over for dinner. Volvos are made by a Chinese company; I’m not sure how buying one of those is a statement for democratic values, either. If you’re thinking about trading in your Tesla for something less offensive to your values, or everybody else’s, I’d say don’t bother. You’ve already paid for the car; selling it to someone else won’t help or hurt Musk or his quarterly goals.   “But if you are deciding whether to buy a Tesla, and you care about basic democratic values, then I think the choice is simple — don’t. I don’t care how cool it is that the car can pick up your grocery bags while you wait at the curb. Musk has made it clear that he isn’t just another self-satisfied entrepreneur with some ignorant ideas. He is the richest man on the planet and a malevolent force in society — someone who not only supports the ugliest kind of nativism and nationalist paranoia, but is apparently bent on using his power to manipulate political dialogue and magnify damaging lies. I don’t know if his end goal is to create a more culturally homogeneous country, or whether he’s just making a cynical play to protect his business interests, but either makes him plenty dangerous. If hate has no home in our communities, then neither does that brand new Tesla.”   A Matter Of Opinion   Bai’s opinion is just that — an opinion. But his piece has gotten almost 3000 comments so far. Here is one I found rational and cogent:   “Let’s be clear: Tesla makes great cars. It is Elon that is breaking down and should be subject to a recall. And his fall is all the more tragic because, prior to 2022 he represented the move away from fossil fuels and towards ecological energy supplies. The company’s integration of solar panels and home storage batteries has made people much less reliant on the existing grid- which is still powered by coal, oil, and natural gas. The cars (and huge semi’s) led the way to fossil fuel free driving and delivery vehicles, and have given people the option of avoiding the internal combustion engine which is a major contributor to climate change.   “That said, Musk (like his new friend Trump) is now doing acute damage to our country. He is given up his principles and is supporting the party of gas and oil. He promised to give $45 million a month to Trump’s campaign. He encourages hate and lies and conspiracy theories on X. He seems to be on drugs.   “I have been an active Tesla supporter for years, but no longer. I have the bumper sticker mentioned in the article, and I no longer recommend Tesla products to anyone (although, to be honest, most of my friends would not be caught dead buying a Tesla at this point). Power corrupts even those who start with the best intentions.”   Others suggested the Tesla board has egregiously failed to do its duty by letting Musk run amok and actually do damage to the company’s main goal — selling electric cars. You might want to browse the comments yourself. There are quite a few that are cogent and insightful.   The Takeaway   Here’s my personal take on this, which is worth precisely what you paid for it. A few days ago, I returned to my primary home after three months in New England. My Tesla Model Y sat parked in the garage while I was away. When I went to get in it, it no longer recognized my cell phone and I had to use my Tesla key card to access the car. I called the Tesla help-line and a very courteous representative helped me reset my phone key.   Shortly thereafter, I got a survey from Tesla asking me about my service experience. I praised the representative who helped me to the skies. Then came the last question: “How likely are you to recommend Tesla?” On a scale of 0 to 10, I choose zero. I am quite happy with my car, but cannot in good conscience recommend buying one to anyone else — not with this fascist serial sperm donor and drug addict in charge.   Many years ago, people all around the world waited hours in the rain and the snow to be one of the first to order a Model 3. Tesla fever was in the air. You could almost feel the energy in the air everywhere. But under  Elon’s guidance , that enthusiasm has dissipated. Tesla is now just another car company, one that is actually trailing several other electric car manufacturers when it comes to making cars people want at prices they can afford.   Musk  is clearly bored with Tesla the car company, and is now fixated on censoring the opinions of anyone who doesn’t agree with him. He has to keep moving fast and breaking things or he is just not interested. That lack of interest is damaging the brand and doing a disservice to those who supported his original dream of showing the world how to transition to fossil fuel free transportation. It is with deep sadness that I say I can no longer recommend that anyone should do business with this man.

"Countdown To Cybercab, Tesla’s Multi-Trillion Dollar Robotaxi Opportunity - Ark Invest",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5Rdkgxdi1DZU1GT3FyXzdhTU8tUlo1SURPMnpNMnBqaWk4Z1ZFU0tSSzMtZmlCN1FHZERqdlRzdUVsOTI5bno1cDRPYUdSSUhwV29rR2RBWmtMUXczRFh5azNvMURBZDBNVFU3QTVFQTFUa0V2N1BYQ28tcWFZWW8?oc=5,"Tue, 08 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","On October 10th, Tesla will unveil Cybercab, its highly anticipated robotaxi, taking a crucial step toward launching its autonomous ride-hailing service. In our view, an autonomous taxi platform will unlock a multi-trillion dollar market and begin to dominate Tesla’s valuation, approaching ~90% of its enterprise value over the next five years. 1 How would Tesla’s robotaxi service work? Through over-the-air updates to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, Tesla estimates it will enable full autonomy in the US during the next year, as shown below. 2  Once the FSD update is live, ARK estimates Tesla could launch a robotaxi service in the next year or two. Even before full autonomy is achieved, Tesla could launch a human-driven ride-hail service, which would collect valuable data on routes, customer behavior, and operational dynamics while also informing its service infrastructure and building its customer base.  When Will Tesla Achieve Full Autonomy?   Tesla Estimate: “...based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that—to be far enough in excess of humans that  you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot. do it next year.”  – Elon Musk, 7/23/24 3 Source: Tesla earnings call, July 23, 2024.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security. Importantly, production of a low-cost Cybercab should not be a bottleneck for the launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service. Tesla’s full autonomy solution should be compatible with vehicles equipped with Hardware 3 and Hardware 4—about 6.5 million cars globally, with ~2.5 million cars in the US. 4  To jumpstart the service, it could deploy a fleet of existing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including those coming off lease and out of inventory, 5  while customers opting to enroll their vehicles in the robotaxi service 6  could supplement the fleet. In the long run, most of Tesla’s robotaxi fleet is likely to be owned and operated by third-party partners, with Tesla hosting the ride-hail platform itself and perhaps maintaining a small fleet of its own vehicles. The importance of Tesla’s ability to scale the fleet quickly should not be underestimated. In contrast, with a fleet last reported to be ~700 vehicles, 7  Waymo currently operates a robotaxi service in LA, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, with wait times higher than Uber. 8  Indeed, Waymo probably partnered with Uber in Phoenix, Austin, and Atlanta because of its scaling challenges. 9 Like Waymo, Tesla is likely to launch its robotaxi service city by city; but unlike Waymo, it should be able to scale much faster, because it will not rely on HD maps or geofencing. Perhaps Tesla’s most important advantage over Waymo, however, is its data lake of real-world driving miles.  According to ARK’s research, Tesla’s customer vehicles drive over 5 million miles per day in FSD, and over 87 million miles per day when including US-only non-FSD miles, generating valuable video clips for Tesla to train its autonomous software. 10  ARK estimates that Waymo’s fleet drives ~70,000 miles per day, as shown below. 11 Note: FSD still requires driver attention, while Waymo does not have drivers in the above data.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security. Waymo’s fleet size and the limited driving conditions of the few cities in which it operates likely have restricted its access to real-world “corner cases.” In contrast, Tesla’s fleet has been collecting diverse camera data from all over the US. Additionally, thanks to its vertically integrated production, Tesla has a clear path to scaling its robotaxi fleet, while Waymo must rely on Zeekr. Based in China, Zeekr could face hefty US tariffs, 12  which may be why Waymo has entered into another manufacturing relationship with Hyundai. 13  ARK estimates that Waymo’s vehicles cost more than $100,000 to produce, its sensor set alone ~$40,000+, 14  though it is working to reduce costs. 15  Tesla’s Model 3 costs $40,000, sensors included. 16  While it needs to build backend support for remote vehicle assistance and customer support, Tesla should be able to leverage its existing factory, charging, and service infrastructure to scale efficiently. Regulatory approval should pose fewer obstacles than have the technical challenges to full autonomy. Competitors Waymo and Cruise have paved the regulatory path. 17  In the US, 40 states either have approved autonomous vehicles explicitly or have not prohibited them. 18 Moreover, its vast data library should help Tesla prove its safety benefits to regulators. ARK estimates that autonomous vehicles could reduce accident rates by  more than 80% . Last year, Tesla’s data already had demonstrated that its FSD-equipped cars were ~5x safer from accidents than its cars without FSD and ~16x safer than the average car, adjusting for city street driving. 19  Meanwhile, Waymo’s cars are roughly twice as safe as the national average with over 70% fewer injury crashes. 20 With higher utilization rates, autonomous ride-hail service could undercut the price of human-driven ride-hail services. New York City taxis currently operate at ~30-40% of their revenue utilization rate, or the amount of time that a passenger is in the car during any given 24-hour period. Autonomous vehicles could exceed a 50% utilization rate, which ultimately would lower the cost per mile. Lower prices should stimulate demand and expand the market over time, as shown below. Notably, even without full autonomy, a human-driven ride-hail service hosted by Tesla could undercut today’s ride-hail rates, as the operating cost of an electric vehicle is roughly one third that of a gas-powered car. 21 *$11 Trillion is the addressable market, not the revenue we expect in 2030, as we do not expect autonomy to penetrate all addressable miles.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security. Thanks to its lower cost structure and the price umbrella provided by traditional ride-hail services, we believe Tesla could command a take rate more than double the ~30% that of Uber. According to our research, as autonomy reduces costs and expands the market, robotaxi platforms could scale to ~$4 trillion in net revenue in 2030, as shown below. 22  Targeting a total available market (TAM) much greater than Uber had envisioned, Tesla also is tackling the largest applied AI project on earth, one that could save more than 40,000 lives in the US and ~1.2 million globally per year. 23 Note: ”EBIT” denotes Earnings before interest and taxes.

"Tesla is still a car company — and for now, that's OK: Morning Brief - Yahoo Finance",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxPY3pxeFUxZWVqemJ6S01MTXQ1d3BzcE1KUTZXTHphRWpyZ3FjblhjMEJmcW5jM0dTR1BUVFVLcDNLMFR4NElwTlFXZFhHZGd2UWM0ajlrUG5CSFlzUTZZNGNwTDlibmVSYjJCeVBxZmx6WWpVSGVwS3VTdDVXS2d0bnpUUmtxZ21kZV9Kd1p3cVV6aGpkaUd6LWl0QV9VdE1GMnlQdzVmcTBQR0xJTTZr?oc=5,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can  sign up  to receive in your inbox every morning along with:   Elon Musk has  told investors  that Tesla “should be thought of as an AI or robotics company” that is going to “solve autonomy.”   We’ve  debated before  whether Tesla is, indeed, a car company and how it should be valued.   What seems more clear after Tesla’s latest earnings report is that for now, Tesla is primarily a car company, and the more successful a car company it is, the more runway investors will give it to transform.   The numbers help tell the story: Tesla’s automotive revenue was $20.02 billion last quarter, a full 79% of the total. Auto services accounted for 11%, and energy generation and storage about 9%.       It was profitability that really encouraged investors last quarter, coming in at 17.1% for the auto segment ex-regulatory credits. That, plus Musk’s prediction that deliveries will rise this year and growth will be “something like 20% to 30%” next year, sent the stock soaring 22%, marking the biggest single-day gain since May 2013.   It also sent Tesla shares back into the green for the year after what’s been a bumpy road. In the two weeks since the company’s robotaxi event, the stock had slumped by 11%. Even Tesla bulls like Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley were nonplussed at the lack of specific details for the company’s robotaxis and cybervans, and they raised eyebrows at demo robots that were reportedly remote-controlled rather than governed by AI.   The tech world has given us many examples of moguls steering their companies toward moonshots and being slapped down by Wall Street if their existing businesses suffered. Meta’s a case in point: After Mark Zuckerberg’s name change from Facebook and spending spree on the metaverse, he course-corrected with a “year of efficiency” that not only saw cuts to spending but a reacceleration in sales. In this case, Tesla’s profitability improved in part due to a focus on cutting the cost to make vehicles.   My colleague Hamza Shaban  wrote in yesterday’s Morning Brief  that the cult of Musk is fueled by his supposed distractions, including campaigning for Donald Trump and nonstop X posting. That may be true for the fanboys and true believers. For the number-crunchers and institutions who buy his stock, it helps to make more money.

Tesla chemical spill: Palo Alto apologizes for delay in notifying residents - ABC7 San Francisco,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOdEczb0haSXRHVW1EX1lWTGo5WnNJMS14NmFvbnBpbEEweFlGUVFRTmp4YmlUd2Y2YXBabGVJN2J0VlNaLWhRRDgtbjI5bWJCUFJRM3V0dkJ1ZkNodlZ2SXNmTnJZS0VweU9YX0VkaW1uYllndkVBYmlPQnFYaDFhd2kyakZsUjMwX05wX1R4S3ZYZXkzUElZRDczWEVLUlRKbTZJNEx30gGrAUFVX3lxTFB2SlFIZnJSRGxkbE9ZWW1JV2FnSU9lc0NoSEg5bGVqeXZFNXQxNnVINU9qeFl4R0lIakplVW5zNzRXcDVYRmg1WGNQNm5PQURmd2p4OHJHUkUxQTFsd28zMUpCQ0ZtTEdmWllXRm5zMi0zTmZfLUVFT3ladk5QUE1LMTNkSWJwWWlqZzBlX0tkNzZEb0wzcllONUJNRXBDSkh2RllxSldrQjVlTQ?oc=5,"Mon, 28 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","PALO ALTO, Calif. (KGO) --  A Tesla chemical spill is under investigation in Palo Alto. Officials say more than  900 gallons of a solution  were recovered from storm drains. PREVIOUS STORY:  Tesla can face fines for chemical spill at Palo Alto facility On October 17, Palo Alto resident Mike Hedlom took this video of the neon green liquid outside a Tesla research facility. ""I was pretty sure it was probably a coolant or a brake fluid, something along those lines but even so it wasn't what should be in the gutter,"" Hedlom said. Hedlom reported it to the city. The Office of Emergency Services said some kind of chemical used to cool the Tesla AI Supercomputer was released into a storm drain, the gutter and Matadero Creek. It apparently happened due to a mistake while crews were draining the Tesla system. The city says the solution does not pose a risk to life or health. ""It's not as bad as it could be, but I still didn't know what it was and we definitely don't want that in the creeks because everything here flows out into the bay,"" Hedlom said. Last Tuesday, Cari Templeton heard from a neighbor wondering why work crews were cleaning up Matadero Creek. After inquiring with the city and Valley Water, Templeton said the next day, the city notified residents about the chemical spill - but this was five days after it was reported. Templeton is running for a Palo City Council seat. ""I think that should've happened sooner rather than later and I think it should've been proactively done by the city instead of as a result of people trying to investigate on their own,"" Templeton said. On Friday, the city released this statement: ""In hindsight and with appreciation for the input received since, staff recognizes that we should have made public notifications sooner. We apologize for our delay in making notifications."" The city says in addition to cleanup, the cause is under investigation. Storage of sodium hydroxide requires a city permit which Tesla did not have. We spoke to Lauren Weston, Executive Director of the environmental nonprofit organization, Acterra. ""We just want to make sure our communities are safe and corporations have an obligation to take care of our communities - they share our backyard, we need to know that they're doing their very best to keep our communities and planet safe - this shouldn't happen,"" Weston said. The city say a final round of testing is underway, and results are expected to take at least a week. Copyright © 2025 KGO-TV. All Rights Reserved."

According to NHTSA, the FSD system's engineering controls failed to ""react appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions.""  NHTSA states   that the crashes occurred in ""reduced roadway visibility"" that ""arose from conditions such as sun glare, fog, or airborne dust"" while the vehicles' FSD mode was engaged. ""In one of the crashes, the Tesla vehicle fatally struck a pedestrian,"" according to the report, while ""one additional crash in these conditions involved a reported injury."" NHTSA will examine an estimated 2.4 million Teslas, including 2016-2024 Models S and X vehicles, 2017-2024 Model 3 vehicles, 2020-2024 Model Y vehicles, and 2023-2024 model year Cybertrucks equipped with the FSD system. Close-up of Tesla logo on a red wall at Tesla showroom, Santana Row, San Jose, California, August 3, 2024. Smith Collection/gado/Gado via Getty Images The NHTSA preliminary examination of the FSD system will assess its ability to ""detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions."" The agency will also investigate ""whether any other similar FSD crashes have occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions and, if so, the contributing circumstances for those crashes,"" as well as if there were any updates to Tesla's FSD system ""that may affect the performance of FSD in reduced roadway visibility conditions."" According to Tesla's  website , ""The currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous."" Tesla did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for comment. The NHTSA investigation follows Tesla's recall of around  two million vehicles last December  over issues with its autopilot system. The company addressed the issue with a software update for the affected models. ""We at Tesla believe that we have a moral obligation to continue improving our already best-in-class safety systems,"" the company said at the time. ""At the same time, we also believe it is morally indefensible not to make these systems available to a wider set of consumers, given the incontrovertible data that shows it is saving lives and preventing injury."""

Why CalPERS is being pushed to divest from Tesla - CalMatters,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE14TGNua09DaXRHcGFJaHZheGpoTDZzVEZxS2JKUHlsZUhYcjUxVHZUQ29vajRGbWl1bXhwTF9STExEbUVNSlZ6cGloT1hQM1R6cjQxV2FkdVJTNUZEb3V3TFpWZVg1MWNCenJDWVhtQWNfbEpTLWMtWQ?oc=5,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla and SpaceX, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, on June 16, 2023. Photo by Gonzalo Fuentes, Reuters           Elon Musk, the tech mogul who runs Tesla, said in December that diversity, equity and inclusion efforts “ must die .” Now, two civil rights groups are calling for the nation’s largest public pension fund to divest from the electric vehicle maker.   On Wednesday, LatinoJustice and the National Institute for Workers’ Rights sent a letter to State Controller Malia Cohen pushing for the California Public Employees’ Retirement System to get rid of its Tesla holdings, arguing that the company’s values are “misaligned,” and that Musk’s claims that promoting diversity is  as morally wrong as racism  is “indefensible.” Cohen is a board member of CalPERS, which had $530 billion in assets as of Tuesday.     The letter:  “In the face of continued occupational segregation and wage disparities by race, national origin, and gender, DEI efforts are an economic and social imperative. California’s public sector workforce is incredibly diverse, with 60% of civil service employees in the state being non-white.”     The letter also cited  Tesla’s $3.2 million March settlement  to a Black former employee who accused the company of racial discrimination as an example of its “troubling values.” The settlement came a month after Tesla dropped prior language from its regulatory filings that supported  employee resource groups and fostering diversity .    A spokesperson said CalPERS is reviewing the letter.     The emailed statement:  “These are serious issues. … CalPERS believes that the employees of every company in which we invest have the right to a safe and healthy work environment, one in which their fundamental human rights are respected.”     In June CalPERS  voted against  a $46 billion compensation package that Tesla  ultimately rewarded Musk , calling it “exorbitant,” while agreeing that Musk “is entitled to be well compensated for his work.”   But pushing for the pension fund to divest is a tall ask: CalPERS is  one of Tesla’s top shareholders . It owned nearly  9.2 million Tesla shares  as of June, which would be worth more than $2 billion, based on Wednesday’s stock price.   Other campaigns for divestment have also failed. After calls from climate activists, labor unions and other advocacy groups, the state Legislature considered a bill that would have directed CalPERS and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (the second largest public pension fund in the U.S.) to  divest from fossil fuel companies .    CalPERS successfully  opposed the measure , arguing that divesting would do little to reduce greenhouse emissions and that fossil fuel companies can simply replace CalPERS with new investors.   But  CalPERS has divested  from companies in Sudan for  the country’s role in the Darfur genocide  and in  Iran for sponsoring terrorism . It also sold off some of its holdings in the coal and tobacco industries, as well as the  gun industry  after the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting.

But it’s the product of mail ballots and the extra time allowed for them to be counted and verified (they can arrive as late as Nov. 12, as long as they’re postmarked by Nov. 5).    The deadline for county election officials to certify the election results is Dec. 5. But they’re already reporting how many early votes have arrived.    As of Wednesday, about 600,000 ballots had been returned, significantly less than at the same point in 2020 or 2022,  according to the Political Data tracker . Election expert Paul Mitchell cautions, however,  not to read too much into the early numbers , including how many by party in districts.    He says the early returns shouldn’t be used to predict winners and losers because of several factors: The mechanics of how each county processes ballots, changes in voter attitudes and differences in messaging by Democrats and Republicans about voting by mail.     Mitchell , on social media: “There’s plenty to learn from early vote, but it isn’t meant to predict outcomes … maybe someday all the processes will be standardized and we will have enough elections to compare … but that’s not true today.”           Garvey outraises Schiff       Republican Steve Garvey speaks during the U.S. Senate candidate forum hosted by ABC7 in Los Angeles, on Oct. 8, 2024. Photo by Stewart Cook, Disney via ABC7           Speaking of the election, let’s get into some campaign news:   U.S. Senate cash race:  CalMatters politics reporter  Yue Stella Yu  writes that for the second quarter in a row, Republican Steve Garvey has outraised Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff in California’s U.S. Senate race, but entered October with less money on hand, the latest federal filings show.   Garvey — who has largely run a  low-key campaign  with a focus on fundraising — raised $5.9 million between July and September, according to campaign finance reports filed Tuesday. His campaign spent a total $5.4 million during the same period, including at least $1.2 million in advertising and media production. He also paid his son, Ryan Garvey, $22,500 in wages, totaling almost $50,000 throughout the cycle, data shows.   Schiff, in comparison, raised $5.5 million and spent $2 million during the three-month period, but entered October with $10 million in the bank — almost three times the $3.8 million Garvey had by the end of September. He also raised $7 million for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid and Democrats in other battleground races, his campaign said Wednesday.    Between April 1 and June 30,  Garvey outraised Schiff  by about $1 million.   Proposition 6 in trouble?:  Despite no formal opposition campaign, the statewide ballot measure to limit forced prison labor  still may fail , writes CalMatters California Local News Fellow  Joe Garcia .   A September poll by the  Public Policy Institute of California  found that half of likely voters oppose  Prop. 6 . One reason could be  Prop. 36 , another ballot measure with broad public support that seeks to increase penalties for certain drug and theft crimes. Assemblymember  Lori Wilson , the Suisun City Democrat who authored the bill behind Prop. 6, said Prop. 36 could be influencing people’s impressions of Prop. 6 and is “messing with the numbers out there.”    Learn more about  Prop. 6’s struggles  in Joe’s story.

China's BYD overtakes Tesla revenue for first time - BBC,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9uTm1RQWlfRFVnOHowTlltb1hNazdlX05FM1pBajNCYUxwWW1aYjdfNXoyZVg5T25wV19kRzBlRFVwVW9sd0hYVVFhVjVhbk00REFIQ3RMcExsQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1RWWpaT2dmUk44UjR0NXpxX0RfNnhmeXZ2TFZzTmZXamdIREdZR05YRTNaYXVKRy0xQ01Ib3ViRmN6NW0temNDTkRlR21UdzFlV2Jib2pmYjVkbnVkOWdN?oc=5,"Wed, 30 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","The Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has seen its quarterly revenues soar, beating Tesla's for the first time. It posted more than 200bn yuan ($28.2bn, £21.8bn) in revenues between July and September. This is a 24% jump from the same period last year,  and more than Elon Musk's company whose quarterly revenue was $25.2bn. However, Tesla still sold more electric vehicle (EVs) than BYD in the third quarter. It comes as EV sales in China have been getting a boost from government subsidies to encourage consumers to trade their petrol-powered cars for EVs or hybrids. BYD also notched a monthly sales record in the last month of the quarter, in a sign that momentum continues to build for China's bestselling car maker. But there is a growing backlash abroad against the Chinese government's support for domestic car makers like BYD.  Earlier this week, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese made EVs came into force across the bloc. Chinese EV makers were already facing a 100% tax from the United States and Canada. The tariffs are in response to alleged unfair state subsidisation of China's car industry. As of last week, official data showed 1.57 million applications had been submitted for a national subsidy of $2,800 per each older vehicle traded in for a greener one.  That's on top of other government incentives already in place. China has been counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy, and the EU is the largest overseas market for the country's electric car industry. Its domestic car industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades and its brands, such as BYD, have begun moving into international markets, prompting fears from the likes of the EU that its own companies will be unable to compete with the cheaper prices."

Tesla just stopped selling the cheapest version of the Model 3 in the US. An analyst called it 'a smart strategic move.' - Business Insider,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPVDg5aFBUU2NfUGVkVk43c1MzOE1wUnlWQzNwLUZkRlQtYzN6RTNHbTk3c2JDdl9QQlFOaXFpNVRMRmExQkxGbWwtckE2MjNSYzF6Q1NCXzBXOHdNTU1QRnY2UFZiWlgtaXljVl96aFdWQjRpd1B5WEdRc1FmR2FheVp3eVVMTS01VjZEWF9SMnBTQQ?oc=5,"Wed, 02 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla  just silently killed its most affordable version of the Model 3 sedan in the US — a good move, one bullish analyst told Business Insider. The Elon  Musk -run electric carmaker removed the Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model 3 version from its website as of Wednesday,  Reuters  first reported. Priced at $38,990, this model had been the company's cheapest entry-level electric vehicle. Now, the cheapest Tesla car is the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, priced at $42,490. The discontinued model used lithium iron phosphate battery cells sourced from China, per Reuters. Earlier this year, the US  imposed  a 100% tariff on EVs imported from China and a 25% tariff on EV batteries and key minerals. Vehicles that rely on Chinese-made components, like the LFP batteries, are no longer eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush and a longtime Tesla bull, told Business Insider that the discontinuation is ""a smart strategic move"" signaling a greater focus on the Long Range Model 3. ""The tariffs on Chinese EVs speak to more tension in the US-China Cold Tech War that benefits Tesla,"" Ives said. He also said that removing the Standard Range model doesn't significantly impact Tesla's overall strategy because the Model Y remains the company's main focus in the US EV market. That car starts at $44,990. Affordability has become a major issue for electric carmakers. Most EV options, including Tesla's, remain more  expensive  than the average gas-powered car. Tesla has long talked about building a  cheaper car than the Model 3 , but it has yet to bring one to the market. Tesla's decision to discontinue the cheapest version of its Model 3 came just as the company slightly  beat  analysts' delivery  expectations , with third-quarter sales rising to 462,890 vehicles. Ives told BI that Tesla's sales were ""a step in the right direction"" to meet its yearly target of 1.8 million vehicle deliveries. Bargain Chinese EVs Adding to the price war are  Chinese competitors  like Xpeng, which recently launched the Mona M03 at $16,800 — less than half the price of Tesla's Model 3 in China.

Nio also has plans to launch a second EV brand named Firefly, which would retail for under $30,000, Reuters  reported  in May. Chinese government policies, including scrapping and replacement subsidies, continue to fuel demand for more affordable EVs in the country, HSBC analysts wrote in a September note. The bank expects over   100 new models to launch in China by the end of 2024, primarily led by the country's EV brands. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment sent by BI outside business hours."

Tesla's Cheapest Model 3 Has Been Replaced By Something Even Better - CarBuzz,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFAwWWJMS1JvcGwwQTkwMmxIRkFiZV8tWGxuTTQ4VnppR0JHWEpnTlBLM003T29aUE9NdXJ6cHNBbHFGU0pRREk4R0dlZGwyWGwzM3Mwdk9PUFhGOU5qeDhjdGdMTlQ4aEI2bTJ3VXE1SkxJMDM4VnVUVWZEX3QyZw?oc=5,"Thu, 03 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla's  Model 3  is one of the  most affordable electric vehicles money can buy , especially with the $7,500 tax credit. First reported by  MotorTrend , the automaker has discontinued the entry-level Standard Range model, leaving the Long Range RWD as the new entry point to the range. In recent months, manufacturers have dropped the base models in several lineups, forcing customers to pay more for the cheapest model.   While that is technically the case here, the base Tesla is lighter on the wallet than the Standard Range. At  $42,490 , the new entry point to the Model 3 range is slightly pricier than before, but thanks to the lucrative incentive, it ends up being cheaper.             Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle manufacturer largely attributed to driving the EV revolution. Through the Model S and subsequent products, Tesla has innovated and challenged industry conventions on numerous fronts, including over-the-air updates, self-driving technology, and automotive construction methods. Tesla is considered the world's most valuable car brand as of 2023, and the  Model Y the world's best-selling car  in the same year, but the brand's greatest achievement is arguably the Supercharger network of EV charging stations.                                  The Long Range RWD Just Makes More Sense                   With the incentive included, the MSRP of the Model 3 Long Range RWD is reduced to  $34,990 . That is remarkable value for a brand-new electric sedan that can reach 60 mph in 4.9 seconds and travel 363 miles (EPA estimated) between trips to the charging station. Of course, the Standard Range model did not receive the same credit when it was on sale.            	  						Google News 			       Add CarBuzz to your Google News feed.             Related     The Tesla Model 3 Project Highland brings fresh upgrades, but not all changes are for the better. Here's everything you need to know.           The reason behind this is the different battery packs that Tesla fitted to the different Model 3 variants. The Standard Range model uses a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) pack sourced from China, whereas the nickel cobalt aluminum pack found in the Long Range RWD is made in America. However, the incentive isn't the only possible reason behind the discontinuation of the Standard Range variant.                            Killing Off The Standard Range Makes Sense                   Earlier this year,  the Biden administration introduced new tariffs on Chinese EVs  and Chinese-sourced components. While this aims to protect the American economy and automotive sector, this will also likely make the LFP battery more expensive to source from China. This means that keeping the Standard Range model around would have been impractical, as Tesla would have needed to up pricing for the same capability. With the latest change, there are just three Model 3 variants to choose from.         Related     At $54,990, the Model 3 Performance is an absolute bargain. Tesla engineers and designers explain how much work went into the electric sports sedan.                         The Updated Tesla Model 3 Lineup            Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive ($42,490)       Long Range All-Wheel Drive ($47,490)       Performance All-Wheel Drive ($54,990)       The Long Range RWD was only introduced in July , which means it's a relatively new introduction to the range. Before this, the Standard Range made sense, but the LR RWD's arrival renders the Standard Range obsolete.     H/T:   MotorTrend"

During Musk's speech at the Trump event, Musk said, ""You know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire.

While his pro-Trump support has exploded in recent weeks, his politics has not. Musk has always been anti-union, actively blocking unions from organizing in his manufacturing plants.       VIDEO       In 2023, Musk told the New York Times Andrew Ross Sorkin during the DealBook Summit that  “I disagree with the idea of unions.”   He has also said he would push to eliminate the National Labor Relations Board.       Celebrities and Progressives   Across the country, Tesla cars have been the darling car of many high profile progressive celebrities — including Leonardo DiCaprio, Steven Spielberg and Cameron Diaz.

""The bane of my existence. My car insurance is through the roof on it,"" said Bissaillon of his Tesla. ""I want to trade it in for a Fiat!""   Some high profile Democrats have dumped their Teslas as a result of Musk’s political views, activism and contributions.

Tesla robotaxi event: Analysts weigh in on what to expect from CEO Elon Musk's big moment - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxNSzNGcUl4ZnBzLTNyRTY1bnpVaE9NZjViQXBzd0FaTHdhZlJvcU14TUIxTmI2amVWQXExUl9GRlRNNWpuOGJfY2p4V2dGbVNDWkgzYVhuVU1POWcyc0RQWVNTUVFXMUY4emtLa0RWV1FUSkMyNGRtMUhwck9wMU03c0tCWjJIVnNFcmRicl9Yd3lvTkNVRFVtVWJYMEVuVGRQN0xnUjVVX2pYUVJPc2w1cGpTczZzTU1sZndCUGoyTlhWVFZmYmM1SGMxUm1ZZw?oc=5,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Wall Street analysts are weighing in on what they expect to hear from Tesla ( TSLA ) Thursday night at the company’s  “We, Robot” event .   While most don’t expect a fully functional robotaxi that can be deployed right away, it’s what CEO Elon Musk and Tesla can do to paint a picture of autonomous self-driving that the company envisions for the next five or 10 years down the road that matters. Possible  leaks have already surfaced  suggesting Tesla may strike a robo-delivery deal with DoorDash, for instance. (Yahoo Finance could not verify those reports.)   Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who named Tesla his “top pick” in the autos space, has nonetheless advised clients to “keep expectations well managed” for the event.   What will most likely be on display is a demonstration of the latest iteration of Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and a demonstration of a fully autonomous ""cybercab"" in a closed or semi-closed course, Jonas wrote last month. But in a more recent note last week, Jonas said investors may hear more about how those cybercabs, or robotaxis, will be deployed.     A demonstration of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised. (Tesla YouTube channel)   ·   Tesla YouTube channel   “It is our expectation that Tesla will offer a 'dual' approach with respect to autonomous ridesharing: (1) the fully autonomous app-based cybercab and (2) a 'supervised' autonomous/FSD rideshare service. We think the latter of these may get the most attention or have the greatest room to surprise investors, at least near term,” Jonas said.   While the cybercab — a vehicle envisioned as one without a steering wheel or pedals — may be the natural fit for a robotaxi, Jonas believes it is the preexisting fleet of Teslas out on the road that, when combined with FSD and Tesla’s upcoming rideshare mobility app, will allow owners of those Tesla EVs to put those vehicles on Tesla’s rideshare service. The true game changer would be unlocking the potential of those vehicles, he said.   A Tesla deal with DoorDash to deliver restaurant takeout could easily be envisioned as part of this service.   Jonas and Morgan Stanley have an Overweight rating and a $310 price target on Tesla heading into the event.   Other analysts believe that the cybercab unveiled could actually be the model or basis for a new Tesla passenger vehicle, the long-promised  “next-gen” vehicle .   NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price   •   USD               At close: April 22 at 4:00:01 PM EDT       Pre-Market: 5:13:08 AM EDT     “For Robotaxi Day on Oct. 10, we expect an unveiling of the ‘CyberCab’ at the venue, [and] some type of robotaxi demo … Moreover, Tesla should unveil the new lower cost vehicle slated for SOP [start of production] next year (“Model 2” or cheaper/smaller Model 3 variant),” Deutsche Bank’s Edison Yu wrote in a note.       Story Continues   Yu is referring to the sub-$30K next-gen EV Tesla confirmed would be coming later this year, one that would open up new buyers to the Tesla universe.   Tesla's product roadmap from 2024 shareholder meeting presentation (Tesla)   ·   Tesla Yu, who has a Buy rating and a $295 price target on Tesla, is also advising clients to be “tactically cautious” on the event, as the bar for wowing the Street is high and the likelihood of a “sell the news” type of reaction is possible. Garrett Nelson of CFRA also believes that a cheaper Tesla EV will be coming alongside the cybercab. While he thinks Tesla plans to create a robotaxi fleet harnessing the cybercab and other Tesla EVs powered by FSD software, he is skeptical of how realistic timing will be for this venture. “We think this [robotaxi fleet] is still several years away and numerous technological hurdles, safety tests, and regulatory approvals are still standing in the way,” Nelson wrote last week.   Tesla's preview of the ride-hailing feature coming to Tesla's App. (Tesla)   ·   Tesla Nelson believes Tesla “remains far from achieving a level of autonomy” that would include capabilities like performing all safety-critical driving functions and monitoring road conditions for an entire trip. Nelson, who has a Hold rating and $240 price target on Tesla, believes the key question for Tesla’s bull case is whether or not investors will give the company a pass on near- and intermediate-term issues, such as softer EV sales, and continue to focus more on longer-term opportunities like autonomous driving and robotaxi deployment. Finally, in a note published late last week, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Thursday’s event will put Tesla’s long-term vision on full display. While Ives and other analysts believe Tesla will showcase the cybercab, its next-gen platform, and FSD and AI updates, Ives predicts Musk will also address the “near-term pain points” seen by investors for self-driving and how the company will overcome them. Ives added that Tesla, for which Wedbush has an Outperform rating and bullish $300 price target, is going through another transformation not seen since the company's volume Model 3 and Y release, with the next phase focused on AI, FSD, and supercomputing. He believes this phase represents $1 trillion in value alone. “We firmly believe that Tesla remains a robotics/AI play in the future rather than just an EV vendor,” Ives said. “We believe this is a pivotal time for Tesla as the company prepares to release its years of Robotaxi R&D shadowed behind the curtains, while Musk & Co. lay out the company’s vision for the future.”   StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

"Tesla Brings Back Model 3, Y Inventory Discounts - CarsDirect",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTEhDQ1NtU0tCUEtENFZkOWhaclZWVXYtTnRZcEVNdlh0ZF9qUVljTEtIWHcyZ1pMMC1lQ2V0YjB0SEhIYXZpMFlOTXlyLTRBeWR4RTAtQm8tbjRFRThWWG1wUC05RHZBT1VCcDZwbnlVVlljTEdwNDkwVndBSXhoaUdDOXBNazFtM0hTX1h2cF9IakU?oc=5,"Tue, 08 Oct 2024 07:00:00 GMT","Tesla is once again resorting to inventory discounts to sell mounting supplies of Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. Based on our analysis, new Model 3 EVs now feature up to $2,800 in savings, with Model Ys offering close to $3,400. Some cars also qualify for incentives that could bring prices to almost $28,000.   At the lowest end of the spectrum, the now-discontinued  2024 Tesla Model 3  Rear-Wheel Drive can be found for $36,260 after a $2,730 ""price adjustment."" Tesla's website says the car in question qualifies for the $7,500 federal tax credit, potentially bringing the EV's price down to $28,760 before applicable taxes & fees.             We found other Model 3s with discounts of up to $2,800. It's worth noting that these are new cars rather than demo units which can be found with slightly bigger discounts but in fewer numbers. On the  Model Y , we're seeing prices from $42,290 for the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive which qualifies for the tax credit too.   Here,  Tesla  says the Model Y could come out to $34,790 with the  tax credit , which can currently be claimed as an upfront discount. At that price, a new Model Y is almost as affordable as an entry-level  Toyota RAV4 Hybrid  (MSRP $33,120). For shoppers ready to go all-electric, this could present a solid chance to save.             Having said that,  Tesla's  financing rates are nowhere near as good as before. Earlier this year, the Model Y  offered 0.99% APR  for 72 months. Now, the rate is 5.29%. On a $50,000 vehicle, we estimate that this translates to a $6,900 increase in the cost of a purchase. We have to wonder if better deals are on the way.   Tesla is continuing to use price cuts to spur demand for its EVs. This week,  Model X lease prices  were cut by up to $277 per month, making it one of the  biggest price drops  on any vehicle. Additionally, we found that Model 3 Long Range lease pricing is now  identical to the previous price  for the now-defunct RWD model.   Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently made headlines for his first appearance at a campaign event for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. At a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the CEO of both Tesla and the social media platform formerly known as Twitter continued his outspoken support of the former U.S. President.

My best friend has been driving the same car since 2010 and I just now had to search “what was the car that had that Janelle Monáe song in the commercial” to figure out it is a Chevy Cruze, because the only thing I remember about it is that we sing the jingle every time she gives me a ride. (Incorrectly, because I also have Lyric Overconfidence Disorder.) And how many times have I tried to go home with the wrong family? I don’t know, because I can’t recognize my own car, which    may or may not be a 2009 (?) Toyonda (?) Eccentro (?). The man I currently think is my husband might just be some guy who was also driving a grey-ish hatchback and happened to cruise by the magazine factory at quittin’ time.   READ MORE:  Know It All: Why Doesn’t Vancouver Have a Mascot?   So imagine the number of times I had to be picked by an Uber driver in a Tesla before I actually noticed that I was getting a lot of  Uber  rides in Teslas. Hundreds, if not thousands! (I’m not proud of the amount of Ubering I do, but sometimes, after a long night of being too lazy to take the bus, I just want to get home as quickly as possible to whatever family picked me up in a Toyonda most recently.)   The point is: something is up, you guys. It’s an electric epidemic… but one that seems to be distinct to Vancouver. On a recent trip to Toronto, I was bopping around in the usual unidentifiable gas guzzlers. The most notable thing about my ride-share experience there was a driver who spent nearly 20 unprompted minutes endorsing Boston Pizza. (Or at least I think it was an endorsement? What he said was, “You just feel every ingredient with your mouth!” so I suppose his meaning is up to interpretation.)   Illustration by Hayden Maynard   According to a spokesperson from Uber, seeing Teslas everywhere isn’t just some figment of my imagination (or, as Tesla’s diabolical overlord/CEO might put it, a glitch in the simulation we all live in). Vancouver Uber drivers do, in fact, drive the highest percentage of kilometres in electric vehicles in all of North America, and the majority of those EV drives are, says my Uber penpal, currently in Teslas. And while 71 percent of Canadian Uber drivers are EV curious, Vancouver’s noble chauffeurs are particularly incentivized by a love for the planet and/or a desperate need to get costs down in a city with Canada’s second-highest gas prices.   READ MORE:  Know It All: Why Is International Village Mall So Empty?   But why not Chevy Volts? Or Polestars? Or whatever Toyonda’s EV offering might be?! These manufacturers simply don’t want Vancouver drivers bad enough, I guess. Tesla is luring them into its cars by partnering with Uber to give drivers vehicle ownership offers: $2,000 in additional incentives for buying and completing trips. (The ride-share company also has a deal with Hertz to rent Teslas at a special rate to drivers.)   I don’t really know how to talk about Uber’s specific programs that encourage drivers to switch to EVs without sounding like an ad here, much like I don’t know how to talk to the teen son I adopted this week after getting into the wrong car again. So maybe I’ll just say that the Zero Emissions Incentive lets EV drivers earn up to $5,000 extra a year, on top of the government’s Incentives for Zero Emissions program, which also offers up to $5,000 for a Tesla purchase or lease. That’s an inspiring chunk of change. If someone offered me $10,000 to overcome my Car Blindness, I’d be pretty tempted to finally splurge on that brain surgery (or flashcards, whatever)."

Disclaimer: I am not encouraging anyone to steal any vehicle — not even a Red Rocket tricycle.   How do you find your Tesla? This is a question we get asked many times as we demonstrate our Tesla Model 3 at EV events and motor shows  throughout Queensland, Australia . Frustrated by the vagueness of the question, I have started to answer with: “Where I left it, they are very hard to steal!” I get sarcastic as the days wear on.   Caution: This is meant to be a humorous article. Like most FUD (Fun, Understanding and Delight), it contains fragments of truth, mixed with hyperbole and other allergy triggers. Want something more serious —  try this .   Prompted by an email from a fellow Tesla owner, I thought it might be worth a tongue-in-cheek article for  CleanTechnica  in these most serious of times. Robert wrote: “… because of the tech within most electric vehicles, it would make it harder to steal. This would require a greater degree of intelligence to successfully steal an EV. Those professional thieves will always pick on low hanging fruit that have the greatest return. That is resale value as a vehicle be it parts or just 2nd hand.” If you have the IQ to tackle a Tesla, you could probably get an easier and higher paying job.   “Tesla vehicles are  rarely stolen  due to their advanced security features, high-tech connectivity, and low demand for parts. The consensus is that the difficulty in stealing and reselling Teslas, combined with the ease of tracking them, makes them unattractive targets for thieves. With a Tesla you would have to be so incredibly good with coding/hacking that stealing a Tesla would be such a poor use of your talents.”   I know a little about the anti-theft capabilities of my 2019 Tesla Model 3, but very little about such features on other EVs, so I reached out to some of the many Facebook communities dedicated to electric vehicles in Australia. Some implored me not to write an article on how to steal an EV, as thieves might make it a challenge event (Tesla already does that for hackers). One suggested the good old steering lock! Others told me funny stories of mistaken identity: “They had tried to ‘steal’ someone else’s Tesla in a case of mistaken identity in a multi-level parking lot.” I have made the same mistake myself — finding Tess. Honk for me baby!   There’s also the story where a would-be thief tried to drop the battery out of a Tesla in the Brisbane Airport long-term parking and ended up in dire need of assistance as the damaged battery resting on some of his more delicate body parts moved into thermal runaway. Of course, this could be an urban legend.   My Tesla was ordered in April 2016 and delivered in September 2019. I had plenty of time to read articles and watch videos as the Tesla Model 3 spread across the United States. One recurring theme was that of security. Apparently, some new owners thought that it would be okay to leave valuables, including their laptops, in the back seats of their very distinctive, expensive new EVs. Come on, I wouldn’t even do that in my Wolseley!   Very little security on this ’60’s gem. Photo courtesy of Majella Waterworth.   Quelle Surprise! Young entrepreneurs discovered that a gentle tap with a hammer would break the window and yield profit making treasure. Tesla, in response, installed Sentry mode to make use of the already existing cameras to record such behaviour. The next wave of news was video of people attacking Teslas, stealing stuff, keying cars, urinating on them with the occasional funny video of a cute kid doing some rap dance. Occasionally some bum crack was displayed also. Sadly, Tesla had to change the face of Sentry mode. I miss you, Hal.   Then came the appeals from police for Tesla owners to supply vision taken by the cars to identify perpetrators of more serious crimes. This occurred in Norway. Tesla owners had moved from being “virtue signalling wankers” (as my brother in law called me) to being a “caped crusader”…“To the bat cave Robyn, we need to recharge!”   While we waited patiently for our delivery, our car was getting better. All at no extra cost. We would have no trouble finding Tess.   On delivery we found that the greatest security feature of the car was the door handles. After we had mastered them, under instruction from the Tesla technician, then came the tasks of teaching our friends, neighbours and family. “You push in the fat bit, then pull on the skinny bit.” Of course, ours being an older Fremont Tesla 3, they couldn’t work out how to exit the car either. We have a minus sign on a button, easy to miss.   Thief confusing door handle. Photo courtesy of Majella Waterworth.   The layers of security on a Tesla are quite intricate. First, you have to know that you need someone’s phone. Then, you have to know the code that opens the phone. Then, there is that door handle thingy, doovey. I am sitting in the car and it is asking for a pin number, WTF? By now you might be looking around for something easier to steal. If you are sitting in the new Highland, you might be there for a while trying to find the gear stick. It’s a button, stupid.   Unless, of course, you have a gun. This is serious stuff now. The most famous Tesla theft in Australia is that of Nick Kyrgios’ lime green Model X. According to  The Guardian  newspaper, “Kygrios was inside his family’s Canberra home about 8:30am when a masked man wearing all black knocked on the front door, describing himself as ‘Chris’. His mother answered the door to find a long-barrel firearm pointed at her.” She was forced to hand over the key and give him some basic information on how to drive the car. However, Nick and his mum got the last laugh, as Nick used the phone app to track the car, slow it down, honk the horn, open and shut the windows, turn on the heated car seats while turning off the air conditioning — all the fun things.   “Chris” has been in custody since March. “The Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court has referred the man to the Drug and Alcohol Court for assessment ahead of any sentencing.” Hopefully he will stay in jail for some time. He has  pleaded guilty to robbery  with an offensive weapon.   And Nick is coming back to tennis (now that all his previous nemeses have retired).   So, what car to steal? According to  Axios , “thieves find old-fashioned, gas-guzzling muscle cars more enviable than environmentally friendly EVs.” Wouldn’t want to be accused of being a virtue signaller, after all! In the USA, the GMC Sierra and the Chevrolet Silverado hold the top two spots. I wonder if that will change as GM goes electric.   In Australia , “The top five most commonly stolen vehicles, according to the RAA’s data, included; the (GM) Holden Commodore, Mazda 3, Toyota LandCruiser, Toyota Camry, and Toyota Corolla.”   On a business trip to Canberra (in the ACT), Majella and I hired a new Toyota Corolla. We were concerned about damage to the car and didn’t want to have to pay up the insurance excess. We parked it as far away from other cars as possible, expecting that it would be safe. But, no, some energetic individual with a grudge against new cars decided to walk across the rooftop car park just for the pleasure of keying this innocent vehicle. Seven hundred excess dollars later… Today, I would park it between two Teslas and feel more secure.   I hope that you have had a few laughs. The takeaway is that, with Tesla, the future is bright, electric, and very secure!       Whether you have solar power or not, please complete  our latest solar power survey .

No, unfortunately my initial reaction was “they’re still alive?”. Horrible, I know.   In the automotive world there are equivalents to this. You know the Tesla Model S? When this luxury EV debuted in 2012 it was nothing less than a game changer in a world where “electric car” conjured up images of Ford Fairmonts filled with lead acid batteries. The Model S put Tesla on the map as a serious contender; it set the template for the high-end electric sedan and influenced virtually all of the lesser Tesla models that followed.     The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   You might already know this, but today I learned that the Model S is  still  being sold as Tesla’s largest and most prestigious non-truck product. Sure, the styling has been “refreshed” over time (in particular losing the fake radiator grille on front) but the fact is that the basic car is thirteen years old. This is an unheard-of length of time for a modern car to remain available, particularly for a range-topping car. Hell, even the 1979 Mercedes W126 S-Class only lasted a little over 11 years, and people thought that was a long time three decades ago.     My kid came into the world about the same time as the Model S, and now he can (illegally) drive a car. That’s kind of like the C3 Corvette- it was released around the time I was born and it was still being produced when I was getting ready for high school. Boy, were we ever ready for the C4 ‘Vette to be released as the The Next Big Thing, and it did not disappoint.   Tesla   I’ve seen renderings of what illustrators think the next-generation Model S will look like; none are showing The Next Big Thing. Some are portraying it as the yet-to-be-released Tesla Roadster stretched out to the proportions of a sedan with cutouts for four doors. Others have tweaked it to look sort of like a Porsche Taycan. I would hope that these speculations aren’t anything close to accurate. If nothing else, Tesla as a brand needs its products to be cutting edge (even to a fault), and playing me-too won’t do it any favors. Seriously, offer me a Taycan and a look-alike Tesla at the same price and why wouldn’t I just get the Porsche?   No, the next Model S needs to be radically different from the current model and, frankly, anything else on the road; a quantum leap like the Corvette C4 was. The Cybertruck certainly stands out, sort of in the same that wearing a fez in public does. Still, I think I’ve found the inspiration for something that might work to capitalize on the Cybertruck visual language but do it much better.   Not Really Straight Lines   As a kid, heavy metal and hip hop might have gotten into your consciousness because of questionable pop acts like Poison, Quiet Riot, or Vanilla Ice. You might have loved this stuff, but if you despised it hopefully you didn’t write off entire genres because of such MTV-era dreck. I’d like to think that your interest was piqued and you moved on to discover artists that had the skills to do these categories right like, say, a Ronnie James Dio or Eric B. and Rakim.   In a similar way, the Cybertruck has been a double-edged sword for superfans of angular styling like me. For everyone infatuated with the Tesla pickup design’s embracing of once-popular straight lines, there are two (or three really) that can’t stand these “sharp-edged cars”.   Tesla   Sadly, they’re basing their hatred of the return of the “folded paper” school of design on the Cybertruck, which frankly isn’t a shining example of the genre. It is, at least in my opinion, pretty bad.   Tesla   What makes the Cybertruck so unappealing to me, and many others as well? Well, as a kid did you ever grab your ruler out of the Trapper Keeper and try to use it draw some of the cool, angular automotive designs of the time like Ital Design’s Lotus Esprit or even the late Marcello Gandini’s Lamborghini Countach? Your drawing looked awful, right? You didn’t realize until later that those Italian designs have few true straight lines or flat planes on any surface. Looking more closely at those disco-era masterpieces reveals that they are made up of very subtle curves and slightly concave panels, and these nuances make all of the difference in the world.   Lotus   Look, for example, at the wheel arches on the Countach and compare them to the Cybertruck. The ones on the Tesla pickup could be made from Home Depot rain gutter material:   SportscarMarket   While I more than welcome the return of sharp-edged cars, using edges so sharp that you literally cut yourself is not the way to go. Can’t Tesla redeem itself by giving us something that does justice to angular cars while still separating themselves from the pack with a nearly timeless design?   Return Of The Wedge   Today, fifty years after the heyday of the angular school of car design, some companies are revisiting iconic examples of that movement with a modern twist. Naturally, the works of Ital Design are the ones most are focusing on; not surprising since Ital’s Giorgetto Giugiaro was sort of the Kobe Bryant of this aesthetic.   There’s been much hoopla about Hyundai making a new version of Giugiaro’s  1974 Pony Coupe , a car that even Ital Design’s own website claims was an inspiration for their later Delorean DMC-12.     Ital Design / Hyundai   Dubbed the  N Vision 74 , the reimagined modern version of this coupe was at one point was actually going to be produced:     Hyundai   Hyundai also showed a more “stock” and far less boy-racerish version of this reimagined  Pony Coupe  that was closer to the original design and ostensibly more saleable, though the latest reports are that neither version of this car is now moving ahead as a production piece.     Hyundai   Regardless, Hyundai has already embraced this aesthetic with their new, original designs like the IONIQ 5:     Hyundai   Truth be told, with Tesla sedans starting to look old hat and their pickup bearing a strong resemblance to a plywood prop in a low-budget  Battlestar Galactica  rip-off, Hyundai is doing a far better job at creating cars that look like “the future.”   As the greatest influencers of this angular style, Ital Design are now actually getting into the revival themselves. Last year they revisited a concept of their own from that era: the  1973 Audi Karmann Asso di Picche  (Ace of Spades) coupe:     Ital Design/Audi   Looking much like Ital’s first generation Scirocco released just months later, the sharply wedge-shaped Asso di Picche never reached production, though one could say that there is a lot of the DNA in the Audi 80 Coupe/UR Quattro.   Ital’s dramatic revival keeps the spirit of the original but with a lower, leaner wedge shape:       The look is taken to extremes as the black windshield blends in with the hood and tops of the wheel arches, continuing down through the grille:   source: Ital Design   Now  this  is the way to do modern angular design right. You get all the shock and awe of the Cybertruck but in a much more cohesive and approachable package.   VIDEO       Sadly, you just know that Audi isn’t going to bite on a design that has none of their current brand language as a production car, but I know one company that should: Tesla. Could something like this become the next Model S?   And The Scale Model Can Be Used As A Doorstop   One of the best things about the Model S was that it dared to be a five-door hatchback on the large side of full-size, something notably sales-resistant in the US. Long before today’s rather silly “four-door coupes” or goofier fastback SUVs came on the scene, the hatchback sedan offered sporting appearance with the practicality of a wagon in legendary examples like the ultra-aero Saab 900 Turbo and Ferrari Daytona ripoff Rover 3500 SD1.   Park Manor Classics ,  Bilweb Auctions   Ital Design even proposed a five-door luxury liftback with Maserati in the seventies. The rather large 1974 Medici I and 1976 Medici II concepts were precursors for the Quattroporte III that came a few years later, by which time Maserati had chickened out and made it into a standard three-box sedan.   Ital Design   The side marker lights suggest that Maserati was considering selling the Medici II in the US, as well as the four-shot rectangular lights that, in the silver color,  really  make this thing look like the car Doc Brown could have converted into a time machine.     Ital Design   What if we took that Ital Design Audi revival and stretched it a bit to be like the Medici to fit our requirements for the next generation Tesla Model S?   Ready For Another 13 Years?   With the disappearance of sedans in general, one wonders if there even will be a next-generation Tesla Model S. I hope there will be, and if so, my guess is that it will set the tone for the aesthetics of more entry-level Tesla cars for years to come. Let’s face it: other than Cybertruck, all of Tesla’s cars are essentially the same thing just squeezed down (the Model 3) or pulled up (Model X) or squeezed  and  pulled (Model Y). Even the coming-soon Roadster uses the same visual language.   If Cybertruck really is ushering in a new aesthetic for the brand (and let’s just assume for the moment that it is), I’m more than happy to see it as long as it’s done right, and that Ital Audi seems like a good place to start.   Ital Design   To work as a five-door luxury hatch, I first need to raise the height slightly, increase the length through both the wheelbase and rear overhang:   Ital Design, Tesla   The dramatic black hood and wheel arch tops of the Audi will need to go away, but I’ve kept the wedge shape with the side windows culminating in a parallelogram-shaped area for the mirrors. A Cybertruck-like light band headlight caps off the now-taller front (which will naturally provide"

DA investigates Tesla spill into Palo Alto creek - Palo Alto Online,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNUUJSMHZvbUYtM19SZjFzdWNVX01GMWpVTm9RMXpkc3lVaXhsd2VLcFctaUQ0V3BnQ1hMNThTQ3k5T2ZHakhtcl8waXJQTEVqMmlNSzduZFF6UGZHSVVxVExEVTNlUDU2M0tQZnJMVWgtYWJUZVBpNGRVX0FsMzFqTldXS0RQTDNxdDcxckdDV3FBTDFIaUdhV1M1RHU?oc=5,"Sat, 02 Nov 2024 07:00:00 GMT","From left, City Manager Ed Shikada, Chief Communication Officer Meghan Horrigan-Taylor, Fire Chief Geo Blackshire and Fire Marshal Tamara Jasso answer questions about the Tesla spill at a Nov. 1 meeting in the Ventura Community Center. Photo by Gennady Sheyner The Santa Clara County District Attorney has opened an investigation into Tesla Motors’  spill of chemicals  into the storm drain near its engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, city officials said Friday. The city is still investigating the exact amount and composition of the chemical, which the company discharged on Oct. 17, but preliminary results showed that the fluorescent green liquid included bright dyes that are used for leak detection and Meras 1020, a chemical that is composed of disodium tetraborate pentahydrate and sodium hydroxide. City officials determined shortly after the spill that the chemical poses no danger to health or the environment. Even so, the  city’s failure to promptly notify residents  about the spill prompted concern from residents in the Barron Park and Ventura neighborhoods, about 30 of whom attended a Nov. 1 community meeting at Ventura Community Center. Most residents didn’t learn about the spill until Oct. 23, when large trucks with industrial hoses arrived to flush out the chemical as part of the cleanup effort. The cleanup concluded on Oct. 25, when someone hit a fire hydrant near Matadero Creek, releasing thousands of gallons of water that further diluted the chemicals, Fire Chief Geo Blackshire said at the meeting. The driver behind the fortuitous hit-and-run got away and the city doesn’t know who that person was. While further testing is ongoing, city officials currently believe based on Tesla’s reporting that the company released about 12 gallons of the substance, which is used to cool its AI supercomputer, into the storm drain. The rest of the  roughly 916 gallons  that was discharged was water that was used to dilute and flush out the chemical, city officials said. City Manager Ed Shikada said that the city has already taken some steps to ensure that spills of this sort won’t happen again. This includes physical changes to the area where the spill occurred. “The drain that was used, that caused the spill, has been plugged so that that can no longer be a source within that building,” Shikada said. But the city is still working to  determine whether to fine Tesla  for storing sodium hydroxide without a permit. According to Shikada, the chemical was stored in the indoor garage space of the company’s campus at 1501 Page Mill Road. The city will determine whether to fine the company once it completes its investigation, officials said. “We are checking back on the permitting of the facility itself to make sure it is appropriate for the use and the method of containment in order to prevent something like this from happening,” Shikada said. The city also learned that the District Attorney’s Office is also investigating the spill. Shikada said that he doesn’t know when or why the office decided to open its investigation. “We just received the notice,” Shikada said. Fire Marshal Tamara Jasso told this publication after the meeting that it’s not uncommon for the Fire Department to share information with the district attorney. That said, the district attorney was not involved in the 2021 diesel spill into the Matadero Creek by VA Palo Alto Health Care System. The DA’s office couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. “We will sometimes contact the District Attorney’s office and provide them information, and sometimes they will contact us,” Jasso said. “In this case, they heard about it in the news and then they reached out.” Valley Water, which has jurisdiction over the creek, has also reached out for information about the incident, which the state Office of Emergency Services attributed to “human error.” The city scheduled the Nov. 1 meeting in response to community frustration with the public outreach. Many of the roughly 25 residents who attended the meeting expressed concern about the city’s — and the contractors’ — failure to inform residents what’s going on. John King, president of the Barron Park Neighborhood Association, said residents still have “post traumatic stress” from the VA spill. Jonathan Brown, who lives on Fernando Avenue in Ventura, lauded the Fire Department for its quick response but wondered whether the city is too reliant on Tesla’s word. “It sounds like we’re still conducting testing, and we still don’t know what was in the substance that was spilled,” Brown said. “When we first went over to ask the cleanup crew, they said it was water with dye in it and the cleanup was just there for the ‘warm and fuzzies,’ Then it came out that that it was coolant that was spilled a few days later, then it came out that it was sodium hydroxide. Then it came out that it was sodium hydroxide and disodium tetraborate pentahydrate.” Jasso said the initial field test was conducted by Tesla, with the Fire Department witnesses. Blackshire said that the test was effectively a pH test to gauge the acidity of the chemical. Later, the company’s contractor, Clean Harbors, conducted further tests. “We don’t necessarily know what it is, but we know what it isn’t from the field test,” Blackshire said of the initial response. “It was just to determine how hazardous is it, or is it not, so that we can start to bring people in and mitigate that.” Shikada said that the city had established a new protocol around notifications so that “any significant potentially hazardous material release will initiate our notifications, as we are already doing in cases such as power outages or major police incidents around town.” This means that residents could expect to see an email blast next time something hazardous is spilled into the creeks. “Our next steps are to take that basic understanding and turning it into operational protocols so in the Fire Department and the city manager’s office we can be clear on how notifications can happen,” Shikada said. Tasso said that the city frequently visits the Tesla facility for regular inspections for various projects that are going on. “And we’re probably going to increase that,” she said.

However, despite the growing trend toward vehicle electrification, the U.S. auto industry still faced a massive carbon emissions deficit last year.

A carbon emissions deficit occurs when a company exceeds the carbon allowances allocated by the government, with one unit of carbon credit equivalent to one metric ton of CO2 emissions.   Last year, GM purchased approximately 44 million carbon credits, but even with the carbon allowances from the government, it was still insufficient to offset its total carbon emissions. The primary reason was the tightening of carbon emission regulations by the EPA, which has been particularly challenging for traditional automakers like GM. However, the situation may change after President-elect Donald Trump takes office, as reports suggest he intends to relax these regulations.   In March this year, the U.S. government finalized new rules requiring automakers to reduce their carbon emissions by 49% by the end of 2032, compared to 2026 levels. While this is more lenient than the previously proposed 56% reduction, it still poses a significant challenge for many automakers.     The tightening of carbon emission regulations by the EPA has placed immense pressure on traditional automakers like General Motors.

As a result, GM was fined $146 million and had to forfeit 49 million carbon credits.   In contrast, while GM is experiencing growing pains in its transformation, Tesla, with its focus on electric vehicles, has been able to maximize its carbon credit earnings. Last year, Tesla earned nearly 34 million carbon credits, nearly doubling the 19.1 million it earned in 2022. However, this couldn’t change the overall emissions deficit of U.S. automakers. Compared to 2022, the U.S. auto industry generated a carbon credit surplus equivalent to about 3 million tons of CO2 emissions.   Moreover, data from the EPA indicates that the fuel efficiency of new vehicles in the U.S. reached a record high of 43.6 miles per gallon in 2023, with projections suggesting that this record could be broken again this year. In terms of automakers, Tesla leads in energy efficiency, followed by South Korea's Kia and Hyundai, while the multinational automaker Stellantis had the worst performance.

I Turned The Tesla Cybercab Into Sports Car With A Whole New Take On A Stick Shift - The Autopian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNUHktY3JoU3daQkFPbWtxcnYtZzBsZmFaWGNocDRSQkpsRHpIRG1FUTA3NDBuN0JjSHdvd1dPWUg3dGY4Uy1iTnl0djNQVmNUaGNwTnZsNGlTQ3ZxbmhRaXRUcFgtclIzZkNYOWRzQkhNMkRZSnYwUmt4Y2dJck85WG5aeVJEY2Z1azZlZU5YMk03NkgtOFR5b2I0a2ZIZmdWR3lKQ3RJdjhnMDAtTHZqNA?oc=5,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Do you ever look back on parts of your life that seem too strange and improbable to be real? I think all of us experienced such a seemingly drug-induced vision a few weeks back.   The event in question was a Tesla-sponsored debut of what Elon Musk purported to be the taxi of the future. If you’ve ever listened to your wife or a colleague at work describe some absurd dream they had last night, then you’ll feel right at home as I detail what played out on screen.     The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person The Tesla Cybertruck Looks Way Better In Person   Elon Musk appears and hops into the open butterfly door of a waiting “cab,” a cab with only two doors. The roofline slopes sharply to a sleek fastback that would seem to negate any headroom for rear passengers, but the lack of a back seat means passengers were never a consideration. The nose is abruptly cut back where a frunk might reside, and the rear wheels are disproportionately larger than the fronts, with all four wearing tires skinnier than a nineties supermodel.     source:  Tesla Cybercab Unveil   Was I imagining all of this? No, it was and is real, and according to Musk this “taxi” will be released by some impossibly near date. You don’t have to delve into the myriad issues of full self-driving to see that the basic concept appears a bit half-baked.   source:  Tesla Cybercab Unveil   Even before the strange dog and pony show where Elon did his typically awkward pitch, rumors abounded that we should be underwhelmed by the cargo and people-carrying capacity of Musk’s cab concept. Further, we had already determined via spy shots that a cab capable of holding three times as many people  could have been built  in a vehicle with the same footprint, as seen below.       We’re really perplexed as to what Mr. Musk was thinking, but just because it seems to be a lousy cab is not a reason to throw the whole car out just yet.   Not A Crew Cab   Despite the criticism, something about the general shape of this new taxi is pleasing enough. You have to ask yourself: is the Cybercab a bad design, or is it a misplaced concept?   source: Tesla   I tend to think it’s more of the latter. In 1981, some genius concert promoter had a guy open for the Rolling Stones on their concert tour who got booed off of the stage, after they were done throwing objects at him that is. Was this a particularly horrific artist that we’re referring to? Well, considering that this opening act for the Stones was one Prince Rogers Nelson, I would say unquestionably not; he just wasn’t a good fit for those who paid to hear  Brown Sugar.  That’s possibly the case with Cybercab as well.   source: Tesla   Indeed, some critics quipped that this Tesla taxi looked more like a latter-day Datsun 240Z than a taxi. I’d agree with that, and such a resemblance to me seems akin to being told that you’re a doppelganger for Brad Pitt: it’s hardly a bad thing. So why, then, isn’t this thing a modern Z-car or futuristic EV pony car? Let’s lean into this.   Model Z (Car)?   Tesla is supposedly going to introduce a new sports car called the “Roadster”, though as expected the launch is being delayed thanks to delays in, well, all of their other delayed shit. The Roadster is naturally being hyped as having some absurd one-second-to-sixty acceleration time, but overall, the thing seems a bit disappointing.   source: Tesla   Reported to cost in the $200,000 range, the speculative renderings show a rather clean-looking coupe, but it’s also rather lackluster in appearance when compared to the Italian (and British McClaren) offerings of similar price. Unless they pump in fake Ferrari sounds, this roadster is guaranteed to provide a rather soulless performance next to the competition. Also, does a lift-off roof panel really qualify a car as a “roadster”? Regardless, with only two seats the thing will pretty much be just a toy for most people, though it’s not like me or perhaps 95 percent of most Autopians could afford it anyway.   If Elon is a true innovator – or, at the very least, a person who brings old ideas to life – then he needs to give us something that we need and have missed. In my opinion, that’s a performance sport coupe. The Mustang is one of the few remaining semi-affordable 2+2 seater coupes out there, and Musk could create quite a stir by offering a sub-$100,000 semi-practical sports car with some luxury as well.   On one end of the spectrum, it’s disappointing that there are no longer GT coupes along the lines of a 2+2 Nissan Z car or the “real” Supras of the eighties and nineties:   source: Nissan, Toyota   At the same time, even higher-end sport coupes are thin on the ground today with BMW M4 being one of the few remaining examples with the recent discontinuation of Mercedes and Audi offerings.   source: BMW, Mercedes-Benz   Maybe Tesla could offer a two-door that’s something in between those two with a bit of Mustang thrown in for good measure. Certainly, the Cybercab sort of looks that part, or at least it will after some work. What if we came up with an alternate reality where Tesla gave us a cab that really looked and functioned like a cab, and turned this current taxi concept into a sort of “Musk-stang” coupe called the Model M?   The Change From C.A.B. To Z.E.D.   Spy shots of the Cybercab showed an oddly proportioned thing with a stubby nose and comically large diameter rear wheels which we thought were merely disguises to fool any observers that saw what they weren’t supposed to. We were wrong.   Exactly why this purported taxicab has the stance of a cartoon funny car dragster is not fully understood. That odd-looking roof that tapers down sharply from a high point just aft of the windshield. Actually, the current Nissan Z-Car has a similarly odd shape to the roofline and I don’t dig it on that car either.     What I’ve done first is bring that roof down slightly in front, and the whole upper section of that car has been laid back slightly to remove some of the meat above the rear wheels; you can see how that character line is now more horizontal.     Here’s a rough animation to show the changes.     That short, abruptly-cut nose gets lengthened slightly so that it matches the gentle character line running all the way to the back of the car. Compared to the original Cybercab, in this modified design the front, middle, and back sections all look like they came off of the same car as opposed to, say, a 1/24 scale model fused to a 1/28 scale toy.     Again, the animation makes it more obvious, You can see that the roofline above where the rear seat would be hasn’t dropped so there should still be headroom back there:     The rear wheel has been brought down in diameter to match the front ones, and the odd aero-looking covers replaced by deep-dish-styled wheels with black centers for a much more aggressive look. Cybercab has tires optimized for maximum economy, which we’ll throw in the recycling bin. We’ve got to add some thick rubber that’s staggered with wider rear shoes. At the rear, the tall tail has been shortened in height and painted black with larger “dual-bar” taillamps:     In the animation, you can also see that the license plate has been moved up and a lower diffuser replaces that rather clunky (Checker-cab like?) bumper on the Cybercab.     The outside now looks more like something ready to hit the Mustang and M4 market, but what about the inside?   Only 2+2, But That’s More Than 2   Currently, the Cybercab has a rather stark interior as one would expect for something that supposed to be a taxi, though honestly it doesn’t look that much more stripped down than Tesla’s current lower-level offerings. It appears to have a bench seat but no provision exist for someone to actually sit in the center, not to mention that those cupholders are going to be decidedly nasty looking after a few dozen trips as a cab.   source: Tesla   The biggest change inside the Model M versus the Cybercab would be the addition of a rear seat. This space in the Model M won’t rival the back compartment of Maybach by any means, but at least you can take two more people than the Cybercab can dream of carrying. There will still be plenty of cargo area left under the giant hatchback. It’s always a pain to have to remove these or have them fold in order to fold down the seats fully flat without bumping into the front seatbacks,  so oh what a feeling, I’ve attached the headrests to the ceiling .   Overhead controls behind the rearview mirror/screen include those for the LCD sun visors and rear glass shading (though you will notice that, unlike Cybercab, I do have a rear window on the Model M to keep the interior from becoming a dark cave).   There’s a steering wheel now, of course, and that bench seat of the Cybertaxi is split into bucket seats with side bolsters, separated by a console featuring fold-out cupholders and the gear lever.     Wait, why does an EV need a gear lever like that?   Sticking It To You   Elon Musk is usually hard to predict, and his choices are often befuddling. It’s hard to know what he’s thinking, and for the most part, I’m glad that I don’t. We do know that he sees cars as ultimately being fully self-driving, and that manual input is pointless. However, what if he had a change of opinion just to be controversial?   You see, based on Musk’s history of purchasing enthusiast cars after he first struck it rich, he must understand that some people actually DO want to drive for enjoyment. However, with most EVs the level of driver involvement is limited other than point-and-shoot. In my alternate reality with the Model M, Elon decides to surprise the world by fitting this new “Musk-stang” with “Tri Mode Driving.”   The first mode is the controversial, packed-with-problems full self-driving, while the second is conventional driving for locales that accept FSD as being pack-with-problems. What about the third mode? That’s where Musk does the unthinkable and gives enthusiasts a simulated manual tr"

In 2023, Tesla still held the  largest global market share among EVs . Elon Musk’s company has simply had more time to refine its battery technology and ramp up production.

This article has been updated to reflect current information about the best Tesla alternatives for the 2025 model year. Certain models had not switched over to the 2025 model year at the time of writing; in these cases, we've used 2024 model year data.         1                                 Best Tesla Model Y Alternative: Kia EV6                           The  Model Y  has been a runaway success for Tesla, and recent price cuts have added to its appeal. Its long range, excellent practicality, crossover body style, and quick acceleration have made it irresistible. A base Model Y with rear-wheel drive costs under $38,000 with the federal tax credit. For around $44k (after the tax credit), you can get the Performance model for just $43,990. This variant will hit 60 in 3.5 seconds, about as much performance as you can get for the price.   However, the Model Y’s blob-like styling now seems a bit plain. Its fit and finish have never been exemplary, and you must rely on that touchscreen for nearly everything.   For these reasons, we’ve chosen the Kia EV6 as our best Tesla Model Y alternative.            	  						Google News 			       Add CarBuzz to your Google News feed.       With a BuzzScore of 8.9 out of 10, you’ll struggle to find another EV we rate more highly. Despite being more expensive than the Model Y (since the Kia doesn’t qualify for a tax credit for the time being), we prefer the EV6 because of its sharper styling, richer interior materials, good driving dynamics, and outstanding warranty. In the table below, it’s obvious that the Model Y remains hard to beat on paper, but the tangible experience of driving and interacting with the EV6 is more special and can’t be measured in mere numbers.

It looks sleeker than its crossover sibling and is more fun to drive, while a base RWD model goes for just $42,490. The base and Long Range Model 3s also have more range than the comparable Model Ys. With an 8.6/10 BuzzScore and after being a  finalist in our 2023 CarBuzz Awards , it should come as no surprise that the Hyundai Ioniq 6 is our favored Model 3 alternative.         Related     Affordable quality and decent range make the Ioniq 6 a good buy, even if you're not spending on the top trims.           Not everyone will warm to the Ioniq 6’s daring design, but you can’t accuse it of being generic. It is also packed with features, we love the interior design aesthetic, and it feels surefooted in the corners. Besides that, its maximum 342-mile range now gets super close to the Model 3. For the 2025 model year, no major changes have been made to the Ioniq 6, so our test drive of the 2024 model still reflects what you can expect for the 2025 model.

Fundamentally, the current Model S is still the same car, but it’s been thoroughly refined through the years with more power and nicer finishes. Right now, it costs $74,990 for the base dual-motor model with its 402-mile range and 3.1-second 0-60 time. The Plaid, meanwhile, asks for $89,990 but returns outrageous performance (0-60 in 1.99 seconds) and a solid range (348 miles) for that outlay. A  CarBuzz Awards category winner , the Lucid Air is the best alternative to the Model S.   The Lucid has a more modern design, a less austere interior, and a better range. The  2025 Lucid Air  hasn't seen any cosmetic changes, but it receives the following updates:                                              Standard HVAC heat pump across the range from the Sapphire                                                                     Additional driver-assistance features are standard                                                                     Complimentary scheduled servicing for two years                                                                     Enhanced audio for Grand Touring                              The base Air Pure RWD starts at $5k less than the Tesla, although it’s not as quick. If you want performance, the Plaid-rivaling Air Sapphire is available but costs a staggering $249,000. However, the lower-specced Airs are great luxury electric sedans.

It starts at $79,990 for the base model with a 3.8-second 0-60 time and 329-mile range and goes up to $94,990 for the Plaid with a 2.5-second 0-60 time and a 314-mile range. These performance figures are still superlative, and features like the Falcon Wing doors still entertain. However, the Model X lacks the prestige and luxury that other rivals offer in spades. One of those rivals is the iX, our choice as the best Model X alternative.   The  BMW iX  may not have three seating rows, but those in the first two rows will be happier than the occupants in the Model X; the BMW has a stunningly crafted interior that is many levels above the Model X’s.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) deliveries in China slipped last month, as exports from its Shanghai plant increased.   Tesla China sold 68,280 vehicles in October, including 27,795 exported, data released today by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed.   That means the US electric vehicle (EV) maker sold 40,485 vehicles in China in October, the lowest since April, CnEVPost's calculations show.

In the January-October period, Tesla sold 500,685 vehicles in China, surpassing the 500,000-unit mark, up 8.29 percent from a year earlier.   Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, both for deliveries to local customers and as an export hub for it.   Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half, it previously said.   October marked the start of the fourth quarter, which saw Tesla dedicate more vehicles to exports.   Notably, Tesla China's overall sales in October that included exports were down 5.32 percent from 72,115 in the same month last year, and down 22.69 percent from 88,321 vehicles in September.     Exports from Tesla's Shanghai plant in October decreased 36.09 percent from 43,489 in the same month last year but increased 72.41 percent from 16,121 in September.     Of Tesla China's October sales including exports, Model Y was 42,265 units, contributing 61.90 percent of sales. This is a 10.39 percent decrease from 47,164 in the same month last year and a 17.37 percent decrease from 51,152 in September.     Model 3 sales, including exports, amounted to 26,015 units, contributing to 38.10 percent of Tesla China's October sales. That's up 4.26 percent from 24,951 a year ago but down 30.01 percent from 37,169 in September.     Retail sales figures for the Model 3 and Model Y in China in October are not yet available.   Across the whole sector, retail sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) in China reached a record 1.2 million units in October, up 56.7 percent from a year ago and up 6.4 percent from September.   Retail sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in China were 673,000 units in October, accounting for 56.3 percent of all NEV retail sales, which was up 36.79 percent year-on-year and up 4.50 percent from September.   This means that Tesla's share of the Chinese NEV market was 3.39 percent in October, down from 6.43 percent in September and down from 3.73 percent a year earlier, CnEVPost calculations show.     In China's BEV market, Tesla's share was 6.02 percent in October, down from 11.21 percent in September, but up from 5.78 percent a year earlier.

Why Tesla supports eliminating the EV tax credit - Morning Brew,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPeERLQmRoNGNjNlB3NzNiWnFZZlZvaE56MG1UQlV0V1ExNFhyay1ydmI3dmpuYzExUi1YSnRPYjc4SEZFRmFxTjhaZmpTQUpXLV9MZXlCV2IyRHR3aS1NZkVDak9tbkw5UXVGSEhkR3hQZG5xd0ZTSEF3OTNwMlNNd3VPa20tUFJ2THVaaw?oc=5,"Sun, 17 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Once President-elect Trump takes office in January, his administration will quickly move to end the tax credit of up to $7,500 that made it cheaper for Americans to buy electric vehicles, according to several  media   reports . To make electric cars less competitive with gas-powered cars (which is the Trump administration’s goal), the removal of the incentive “could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,” the head of insights for Edmunds.com, Jessica Caldwell, wrote in a note last week.  That trajectory  was already on a downward trend due to the high prices of EVs and a lack of charging infrastructure nationwide. An auto industry trade group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, called on Congress prior to the election to keep the tax credits around since they are “critical to cementing the US as a global leader” in auto production. But that trade group doesn’t represent Tesla, the biggest EV seller in the United States by a longshot. And Tesla wants them to end Take it from the CEO himself. Following the initial Reuters report that Trump would move to eliminate the credits, Musk  posted  on X, “In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas.” Why would that be? Tesla has a dominant position over EV automakers in the US, and removing the credit would further entrench that lead by hammering the competition. In a July earnings call, Musk said the credit removal would be “devastating” for Tesla’s rivals but only hurt it “slightly.” Tesla sells its EVs at a sizeable profit, while competitors like Ford and GM lose money on every EV they sell. Making EV production less economical would dent Tesla’s margins but could force its legacy automaker peers to stop churning out EV models entirely (even with the tax credit in place, Ford idled production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup through the end of the year). Looking ahead… because the tax credits are included in President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Trump can’t remove them without an act of Congress. But Republicans, who will control both chambers next year, can get it done without Democratic votes through a process known as reconciliation (which Democrats used to pass the IRA).

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.

Tesla API pricing could destroy many third party apps - Mashable,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5pbTFPV2FneWZlcHFINi1fYVNoRzB1N2pyeDFvaVVVNU53RzczdExBVHlHLXQ0NHdWb29nOWJLdzlxOVdzRXg1TjF3MXg1ekRaM0dSSjgzR09RZw?oc=5,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla's   API pricing is live , and the news is not good for third party app developers.  On Thursday, the company revealed third party API pricing, which varies related to the type of data the app requires. Streaming vehicle signals to the app, for example, cost $1 per 150,000 signals; performing commands on a Tesla device costs $1 per 1,000 requests; polling a limited set of data from the vehicle costs $1 per 500 requests, and waking up the vehicle from sleep costs $1 per 50 requests.  Tesla  got an official API  (application programming interface) in October 2023 after years of developers having to rely on an unofficial API. But access was free — until now.      It doesn't sound like much at first glance, but it adds up very fast.    Credit: Tesla       This can be hard to put into perspective if you're a regular user, but for some third-party app developers, these prices are a deal breaker. On  Reddit  (via  Electrek ), the developer of popular third-party app  Tessie  said it would cost them $60 million per year to keep operating at current API pricing rates.    Tessie is an app that offers a comprehensive set of information on your Tesla car, such as real-world range, battery health, and charging times. It also allows the user to perform certain commands on the car. According to the developer, Tessie makes an API call to a car every 30 seconds when the car is ""awake and busy.""   ""Assuming someone leaves Sentry on (common) and the car stays busy, and there are 43,829 minutes in a month, that's 87,658 calls per month. At $1 per 500 requests, that's $175 for one month for one vehicle - not counting wakes or commands. In the worst case, where all vehicles are subscribed and all vehicles have Sentry on, it's actually 470,000 vehicles * $175 = $82,250,000 per month or $987,000,000 per year."" Tessie is a paid app, but these costs are obviously unsustainable. The Tessie developer said they plan to circumvent this by using ""direct car communication over IP and BLE,"" which will require a ""wild amount of effort."" Tyler Corsair, founder of another popular Tesla app  Teslascope , also voiced his opinion in the same Reddit thread. ""The current rates will put the majority (if not all) third-party services, including my own. To provide the same frequency of data would cost Teslascope 7.5x its monthly revenue.""   And the developer of another third party app,  Teslemetry , said it would cost him ""25x revenue at this point."" Tesla does not provide a way for the media to send inquiries, so we can't ask about the reasoning behind these rates. If nothing changes, however, it appears that a lot of third-party apps are going out of business.  With this move, Tesla appears to be going the same path as  X (ex-Twitter) , and  Reddit , which put a lot of developers out of business when they drastically increased API pricing for third party apps."

The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

The Nov. 16 post also says: ""Imagine a world where you could drive without ever needing gas or even a charging station — just pure, clean solar power. Elon Musk, the man who’s made electric cars mainstream and sent rockets to Mars, is now unveiling his latest game-changer: a Tesla that runs on the power of the sun. And here’s the real shocker — it costs just $7,000.""   (Screenshot of Facebook post.)   The post includes two images showing Musk next to what appears to be Tesla cars.       Sign up for PolitiFact texts           The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Meta , which owns Facebook, Threads and Instagram.)   As of Nov. 19, PolitiFact found no evidence that Musk is releasing a solar-powered Tesla.   Tesla  uses  lithium-ion batteries, not solar panels, in the electric cars it makes. Tesla also doesn’t have a vehicle that costs $7,000; the cheapest car on its website goes for  almost $30,000 .   In 2022, an Australian inventor said he was taking a car and charging it with ""a lightweight technology that can generate electricity from sunlight,""  according to a Euronews article .    The article said that Paul Dastoor, a physics professor at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, would use 18 specially-designed solar panels to power a Tesla for a trip around Australia.    The project,  Charge Around Australia , started in  September 2022    ended  in January 2023 and sought to advance solar power technology. We found no evidence that Musk was involved.    In a  2023  ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, Musk  was asked  whether there would ever be a vehicle that can operate entirely on solar. Musk said the car will need to unfold the solar panels like a Starlink satellite, but that ""you just don’t have enough surface area for it.""   Host Joe Rogan then  asked  Musk: ""But it's never going to get to a point where you can just have a car that's made out of solar panels that it could drive around, it could never be that efficient?"" Musk said: ""Correct, so you do not have enough surface area.""   We also searched Tesla's website, and the only solar-related products are  solar panels  and  solar roofs . The website mentions no Tesla-made solar vehicles.   PolitiFact contacted Tesla for comment but received no reply by publication.   We also found no  official Tesla announcements , credible media articles or news stories in the Nexis news database about a supposed $7,000 solar vehicle.   This isn’t the first time we’ve fact-checked posts announcing fake inventions by Musk. We rated a claim that Musk announced a new water-powered car  False .   We also rate the claim that Musk released a $7,000 car that runs on ""pure solar"" False."
Tesla owners turn against Musk: ‘I’m embarrassed driving this car around’ | Elon Musk - The Guardian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE50VUNvY21SdnRDZjVtd0VFYkNUZFB3Tlg1SnFnQVg2QzZHcFJqZlRKLVliSktPcmxmR1Q0aEtNR1hGeUpJR0k0ZGpkNkhUNG96VmNmcXFQM29MekVadmZIYkE4ak5hWTZfWHVHaEFaUHpGOW9sVUY3MWh4dVNFQQ?oc=5,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","A s Elon Musk has embraced Donald Trump and various far-right conspiracy theories, he has left behind an aghast cohort of  Tesla  owners who suddenly feel embarrassed by their own cars. Many of them are now publicly displaying their dismay at Musk on their vehicles. Sales of anti-Musk stickers have boomed since the world’s richest man declared his support for Trump and helped propel him to victory in the US presidential election, as owners of Teslas, the car brand headed by Musk, try to distance themselves from the South African-born multibillionaire. “Sales have really spiked. The day after the election was the biggest day ever,” said Matt Hiller, a Hawaii-based aquarium worker  who sells a range of stickers online  that denounce Musk. “People saw a billionaire supervillain buy his way into the administration and it rubbed them the wrong way.” Hiller started the sticker range last year after deciding against buying a Tesla due to Musk’s “amplifying of horrible people and silencing of others” on X, formerly Twitter, another of his companies. Several hundred stickers a day are now being sold, primarily to Tesla owners, Hiller said, bearing texts such as “Anti Elon Tesla Club” or “I Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy”, or a picture of Musk in clown makeup with the words “Space Clown”. “People keep telling me that they feel they can drive their Teslas again with these stickers,” said Hiller, who has had to set aside part of his house to accommodate the growing operation. Hiller devises slogans such as “Elon Ate My Cat”, a reference to  a debunked falsehood  about migrants eating pets in Ohio, that are then sold on Etsy and Amazon. “People are shaken up. It’s a relief really to see they are awake,” he said of the surging demand. Musk, who has an estimated  wealth  of $314bn, was once considered an environmental hero and technology pioneer by many US liberals after turning Tesla into the most  valuable  car company in the world while warning that “climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI”. But his reputation among electric vehicle-buying liberals curdled as he used X to trumpet far-right  conspiracies , fulminated about the “woke mind virus” and enthusiastically promoted Trump, even appearing at the president-elect’s  rallies  and  funding  campaign operations for him in key battleground states. Elon Musk and Donald Trump.  Photograph: Brandon Bell/Reuters Musk is now intimately involved in Trump’s incoming administration,  heading  a new “Department of Government Efficiency” that plans mass layoffs of US government workers. Some Tesla owners have been left horrified. “I thought Elon was progressing our country, but he’s turned out to be kind of an evil person. It’s scary for someone with that sort of money to be so close to a politician,” said Mika Houston, a gymnastics teacher in Las Vegas who has had a Tesla Model 3 for the past three years. “I still love my car, but I think about whether I’m endorsing that sort of behavior when I drive it. I’m embarrassed driving this car around after the election, thinking about the man behind it,” said Houston, who has bought an “Anti Elon Tesla Club” magnet for her car and is mulling whether to sell it. Pamela Perkins, a photographer who lives in the Tesla heartland of California’s Silicon Valley, has a Model Y but is among a group of friends who are all considering ditching their Teslas. “I’m turning 80 in January so I thought I’d have a sporty car that I could race anyone when the light turns green,” Perkins said of her purchase. “There was a time I thought  Elon Musk  was a genius but he went bad very quickly. I remember saying to my husband I should sell this car and send a message, for my own conscience. “A lot of people have asked if I’m going to sell the car, I have a friend who was about to get a Tesla but decided not to because of him. But [Musk] doesn’t care about us, he has bigger fish to fry. He wants to colonize Mars.” It’s unclear whether this backlash against Musk will hurt Tesla, which remains the dominant electric car company in the US. Sales have struggled somewhat this year, with a 7% drop  forecast  in the latest quarter compared with the same period in 2023, although analysts put this down to increased competition from other car makers and a stale Tesla lineup that has little changed apart from the  much-hyped Cybertruck . “Tesla isn’t the only player in town now and they haven’t been aggressive in putting new products out,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. “Elon is Tesla: his persona definitely has an impact upon the perception of the brand, and he has been polarizing. I don’t think we’ve seen any impacts in sales because of this – yet. I do think this will happen, but it remains to be seen which consumers he attracts and which he loses.” Another uncertainty is how Tesla will be affected by policies pursued by Trump. The incoming president has called the shift to electric cars “lunacy”, said that supporters of such vehicles should “rot in hell” and vowed to strip away incentives to purchase them.  Trump has somewhat tempered his invective against electric vehicles  following Musk’s endorsement but is still planning to remove a key tax credit for new buyers. For now, though, there is a windfall for those selling anti-Musk merchandise. “I feel like people really wanted to make their voices heard in some way, even as passive as it is,” said Stacey Davis,  who started selling Musk bumper stickers a year ago . Davis, who has a Tesla, said she has had an 800% increase in sales of these bumper stickers on Etsy since the election. “Elon started not aligning with what I believe in and he just started being really weird, extra,” said Davis. “At first we’re like, OK, he’s just one of those eccentric types of people. But then when he went into his political stuff and I was like, oh no, this is not it.” With a Trump presidency looming over the US for the next four years, Musk’s involvement is a bittersweet prospect for some sellers. “I’d be happy for him to disappear from public discourse and just be another rich guy,” Hiller said. “If I never sell another Elon sticker that’s fine. I’d rather him just be gone for the country’s sake and I can go back to making stickers of fish.”"

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas.

I Picked Up This Cybertruck on Oct 30th. On Nov 3rd It Was Dead and Tesla Has No Idea What's Wrong.

Elan Michael, a Tesla Cybertruck owner, recently shared ongoing issues with his new vehicle, which has been unresponsive since early November. After initially believing a 48V battery failure was the culprit, Tesla service has now updated Elan, explaining that the problem stems from the Power Conversion System, an essential component managing power distribution in the Cybertruck. Technicians are currently working to resolve the issue, with the hope of having the vehicle ready by Friday.   Look how some other Cybertruck owners responded to Elon and shared their experiences in this video from  the Torque News YouTube channel .     VIDEO       But this is what Elan wrote two days ago.   I "" picked this car up on Oct 30th, on Nov 3rd it was dead in my garage, unresponsive to anything ,"" wrote Elan on the  Tesla Cybertruck Owners  group on Facebook. He continues saying, I "" couldn't even open the doors. Thus, I had it towed to Tesla service center. It's now November 12th, they tried changing the 48v battery to no success. They have absolutely no idea what's wrong with it and just keep moving my completion date forward. ""   Fast forward to yesterday November 13th, and there's news that  Tesla has announced a recall for the Cybertruck  - the sixth this year, but this one feels particularly relevant. This recall involves a fault in the drive unit inverter, which, much like the heart in your body, is crucial for the Cybertruck's electric system. It's what converts the battery's power into something the motor can use. If it fails, you've got a situation not unlike Elan's: a vehicle that can't move.     VIDEO       But late last night Elan, gave the group members a new update that Tesla mechanics finally called.   "" They called me end of the day today and said they figured out the problem with my Cybertruck. It's the Power Conversion System. Tesla said they will work on it tomorrow (meaning today) and hopefully, the car will be ready Friday. We shall see. Last week they told me it was the 48V battery, and when they did the work it didn't help, so holding my breath. ""   Elan’s experience has drawn significant attention from other Tesla owners, as it coincides with Tesla’s recent Cybertruck recall addressing power and connectivity concerns that could cause unresponsiveness. In fact, about 70 people commented under Elan's post.   One of them says this is a Lemon Law, another says give Tesla a chance to marke it right, to which I agree, and yet others share their own experiences with the Cybertruck. One of them, with a user name Gina Beaux Bina, writes:   "" Definitely frustrating and hearing this too often on the Cybertruck pages lately. Something similar happened to us on a long road trip. We weren't provided a loaner to get home, despite them knowing we were going to have to also drive back to get the truck. It took a week to be completed, was a new ""ribbon/module"" recall/service bulletin issue located under passenger side. Meanwhile, there was no guarantee that whole time that what they were doing was going to fix it - but I guess that's just how some computer/electrical problems are: replace parts and re-test. We've had it since early June, and 7,000 miles on it. We have multiple vehicles to fall back on, but for people who depend on their Cybertruck as their only vehicle, this has to be frustrating and costly. Furthermore, how are these vehicles being let out of production with so many issues? With such low mileage, it seems like these issues would have revealed themselves during very basic production testing, before release, and certainly by now so they could be proactive about repairs .""   Obviously, this is not a cool way to treat a Cybertruck Foundation owner. And keep in mind, that these things happen with every type of car.   Yet, Tesla was trying to make it right.   I think Tesla’s identification of the Power Conversion System issue could be a step toward remedying the Cybertruck’s initial reliability concerns, especially as other owners report similar early-stage hiccups. Elan remains cautiously optimistic but expresses understandable frustration, sharing, “Last week they told me it was the 48V battery... so holding my breath.” His case underscores the challenges of adopting brand-new models but also highlights Tesla’s commitment to resolving these issues in real-time.   Tesla’s response to these issues will be a critical factor in shaping carbuyer trust. With more owners sharing similar experiences, many are watching closely to see how effectively Tesla can address these initial Cybertruck reliability hurdles.

People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "

NHTSA probes Tesla's FSD software amid safety concerns over misleading social media posts - CBT News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxPVDMycTNHdUVKeGV1YkNYbnViSk5GSW1OZzFJSUlYbzJfUDh5SnZjcW9oSWtZOGI1Q1JxUy1zM1A3X19TUEtUUUVodDJyOEo4eWtoXzEyLWdTN0UxOU4yUVRVQ1RsU0tJWl9Ebkd1SEJfS1BUaVZMYXl3M0Y1SXVaQ0kxLVRuNkZsY0lDdjBFZHo1aVZXdXl4Q29aa0hQTWViMGU3SUdqYXN2bWVJckhYTnRSSQ?oc=5,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","The  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) is investigating Tesla’s  Full Self-Driving  (FSD) software following concerns raised by the automaker’s social media posts.    These posts appear to suggest that FSD can operate as a robotaxi without requiring driver attention. The agency’s investigation, which began in October, covers 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the FSD system following reports of four crashes, including a fatality in 2023, where conditions like sun glare, fog, and airborne dust may have contributed to the incidents.   The NHTSA raises concerns about Tesla’s promotional materials, including posts on the social media platform  X , formerly known as Twitter. These posts appear to encourage drivers to use Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology while not maintaining full attention on the road.     One post featured an individual using FSD to drive 13 miles to an emergency room during a heart attack, while another described a 50-minute drive home from a sporting event. NHTSA argued that these posts conflict with Tesla’s stated messaging that FSD requires driver oversight and intervention.     In a letter sent to Tesla in May, NHTSA expressed its concerns about the posts and asked the automaker to reconsider how it communicates the capabilities of its driver-assistance systems. Tesla responded by reiterating that its owner’s manual and other materials clearly state that FSD is not autonomous and requires driver vigilance.   As part of its ongoing investigation, NHTSA has set a deadline of December 18 for Tesla to answer questions related to the system’s performance, especially in conditions with reduced roadway visibility. The agency is examining whether Tesla’s system provides adequate feedback to drivers, enabling them to make real-time decisions about when the system’s capabilities have been exceeded.   This investigation explores a tragic incident in Rimrock, Arizona, where a driver struck a 71-year-old woman after she exited her vehicle following a rear-end collision. A Tesla operating in FSD mode struck her. At the time, the driver of the Tesla struggled with sun glare and has not faced any charges in the incident.    In December 2023, Tesla agreed to recall more than 2 million vehicles in the U.S. to install new safeguards in its Autopilot system under NHTSA’s pressure. However, the agency is still evaluating whether these safeguards are sufficient to address the ongoing safety concerns associated with Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance systems."

Tesla Excluded From EV Buyer Credits in California Proposal - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQRVBhaUE5MENVN0NyemhWcmNoZDdudzgzV2FfQVFlUUl6OVdOUE1Id3d2TFIzYmc1aHMxQnhOdFFEWVQxOHNfdkpycTRvcnp5S1hlTU9wWlpBQ2RmLWFXaU5HOHlkVUFfbnBZQUVaRV91YjNjVG52ckVpVTZrQWtQYXROOGtuV1U?oc=5,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicles would be shut out from consumer rebates under a proposal by California Governor Gavin Newsom, pitting the prospective Democratic presidential hopeful against Republican power player Elon Musk.   Most Read from Bloomberg   Newsom on Monday unveiled plans to offer rebates to EV buyers if US President-elect Donald Trump repeals a federal subsidy. A program California phased out in 2023 could be rebooted in lieu of the $7,500 tax credit, the governor said.   His office told Bloomberg News that the current proposal includes market-share limitations that would exclude Tesla’s popular EV models. The details — including Tesla’s possible omission from the credits — will be negotiated with the state legislature and could change, Newsom’s office said.   “It’s about creating the market conditions for more of these car makers to take root,” according to the governor’s office. It wasn’t immediately clear if other automakers would be excluded.   Musk, Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer, posted on his X social-media platform that the proposal was “insane,” citing the automaker’s manufacturing presence in the state.   The move would leave market-leading Tesla out of a key incentive program aimed at spurring wider adoption of EVs at a time of slowing growth for all-electric vehicles. Tesla’s models do qualify for the federal credit, which was introduced as part of President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act.   Excluding Tesla could burnish Newsom’s standing on the left as he renews a clash with Musk, who has become a member of Trump’s inner circle and accepted a role helping the incoming administration cut government spending. Musk has said he’s fine with federal subsidies going away.   “This is a slap in Tesla’s face,” Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, said of the California proposal.   California Tension   Tensions between Musk and Newsom have been strained for years, with the Tesla leader moving the automaker’s headquarters to Texas in 2021, in part citing frustration with California’s politics.   Musk had angrily denounced state orders to close Tesla’s Fremont factory during the Covid-19 pandemic, labeling them “fascist” in an earnings call. When Musk announced the headquarters move, Newsom said Tesla owed some of its success to California.   Tesla still accounts for more than half of all new EVs sold in California, but its grip on the market is slipping. Tesla’s sales in California fell 12.6% during the first three quarters compared with a year earlier, even as overall electric-vehicle sales in the state rose 1%, according to the California New Car Dealers Association. Tesla made 54.5% of all EVs registered in the state during the first three quarters, a significant drop from 63% during the same period last year.       Story Continues   California clashed with Trump frequently on auto emission regulations during the incoming president’s first term, and the state’s leaders have made clear they are now girding for another fight. Newsom already has sought to shield the state’s policies on issues including reproductive rights, climate and immigration from potential threats under a Trump administration. Trump has long criticized the Biden administration’s efforts to subsidize EVs in a bid to boost adoption of cleaner cars. His transition team is now looking to slash fuel-efficiency requirements for new cars and light trucks as part of plans to unwind Biden policies the president-elect has blasted as an “EV mandate,” Bloomberg News reported last week. California, as well as states including Oregon and Colorado, currently are exempt from rules that preempt them from enacting their own emissions standards for new vehicles. More than a dozen states representing more than a third of the US auto market now have formally opted to follow California’s rules. Trump in his first term targeted California’s right to set tougher gas mileage rules than the federal government. He is expected to make another attempt to roll back the California carve out under the 1970 Clean Air Act after taking office in January. Tesla shares were down 2.9% as of 3:53 p.m. in New York. --With assistance from Kara Carlson, Gabrielle Coppola, Ryan Beene and Brian Eckhouse.

Tesla stock closes at highest level in over 2 years as Musk's big Trump bet pays off - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNY0xnTENLZ0pNeWNaZTluRno3Q3lscEVMdF9yT28yTGdVcXFJS3ktYzBrc2pzMjJlQURFdE81a19zQ01Wb2JPRWVmcEFZbHdRWUxncGhWMXVJTi1ORExQTWJPYWpqS2I5MVJoSEx5SjRFOEhTV194S2otVWRDZnowSVdhcWdwTHhzNERJUjJzQzE3M3lod044dUl2blhmdUlkR2dNeFUzVWN1dXVVeWFDUXh2Z2JsTk9JQjZrd185MGU4eGxRRDlFNw?oc=5,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla ( TSLA ) surged on Friday, capping a huge week for the EV maker as the stock hit its highest close in over two years. Optimism over CEO Elon Musk’s relationship with President-elect Donald Trump has sent investors into a frenzy, with Tesla’s market cap now topping $1 trillion.   To be fair, stocks overall have been hitting records, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossing 44,000 for the first time and the S&P 500 eclipsing 6,000. But the monster move in Tesla has been one for the record books, with the stock up a whopping 29% in just five days.   Tesla stock rose 8.2% on Friday to $321.22, hitting as high as $328.70 as the company achieved a trillion-dollar valuation for the first time in over two years. Only Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta are worth more, meaning the original “Magnificent Seven” has re-formed.   NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price   •   USD               At close: April 22 at 4:00:01 PM EDT       Pre-Market: 6:02:03 AM EDT     Massive moves both upward and downward are not new for Tesla, though recently the stock has been moving higher after early 2024 weakness. Better Q3 earnings and deliveries, and the promise of Tesla’s robotaxi Cybercab testing in earnest next year, have fueled optimism, even before this week’s Trump-inspired stock rally.   While Musk is in charge of companies like SpaceX (which includes Starlink) and X (formerly Twitter), Tesla investors have the most to gain — or lose — from Musk's ties to Trump.   Threats of rolling back EV tax credits by a Trump White House and GOP-led Congress were thought of as headwinds to the Tesla volume growth story. Wall Street and investors are looking past that thorny issue, for now.     President-elect Donald Trump offers his hand to Elon Musk backstage during a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds on Oct. 5, 2024, in Butler, Pa. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)   ·   Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images   ""Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry, and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years,"" Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a note on Wednesday.   ""We believe a Trump win could add $40-$50 per share to Tesla's stock,"" Ives added, noting that the company could exceed $1 trillion in market cap ""if autonomous/FSD is accelerated starting in 2025.""   Beyond Tesla, because of Musk’s support of his candidacy, Trump has even promised Musk a position in his administration, suggesting  Musk could head a commission  to boost government efficiency.   It is because of that closeness to Trump, trade policy, and even environmental and manufacturing initiatives that Musk may have a hand in that investors are keen to bet on Tesla."

Tesla said as a remedy it released an over-the-air software update for free. Owner notification letters are expected be mailed on Feb. 15, 2025.  This isn’t the first recall the car manufacturer has faced. Its Cybertruck alone has received seven recalls this year,  The Associated Press reported . Last month,  a recall on the Cybertruck  centered on ""a fault in the drive inverter,"" which the NHTSA said ""may cause a loss of drive power to the wheels."" That recall involved around 2,400 vehicles. In that case, Tesla said it would replace the drive inverter for free.  In July, Tesla issued a recall for more than  1.8 million vehicles  after it received reports that the hoods on some were unintentionally popping open."

The expansion brings the total NECN to more than 100,000 public chargers in the US and 25,000 in Canada.   Nissan EV owners will need a  Nissan-provided North American Charging Standard (NACS) adapter kit 2  to access Tesla Supercharger stations, now available for $235. The kit can be ordered starting today through a Nissan dealer and is available online at  NissanUSA.com . Starting in 2025, Nissan will begin fitting EVs for the U.S. and Canadian markets with a NACS port.   In addition to the newly added Tesla Supercharger network, NECN also includes access to Electrify America, the Shell Recharge branded network, ChargePoint and EVgo networks, in the US. In Canada, access includes ChargeHub, Shell Recharge branded network, FLO, Chargepoint, Circuit Electrique, BC Hydro, and the IVY branded network.   ARIYA owners can easily search real-time charging station availability, charging status and pay for charging all through the MyNISSAN app. This enhancement to the MyNISSAN app simplifies EV ownership by consolidating vehicle management and public charging into one app. Users store a default payment method in the MyNISSAN app, then once at a compatible in-network charging station, simply tap an on-screen button to start a charging session within the NISSAN ENERGY Charge Network. This functionality is not currently available to Nissan LEAF owners; however, they can search charging locations through the NissanConnect EV and Services app.     # # #   For more information about our products, services and commitment to sustainable mobility, visit  nissanusa.com .

Tesla’s leasing push aims to offset U.S. sales decline - CBT News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQcnJ2Tlc1ZzRPV3ZwRTVBNjNqdE9iS3RTZGQzSHZaR050M0VuejZpTXMteTEtaVQtQXRTTVU4NGF1OGkwX2k2djJVYjF6bVppeVFKb2Y5ZTBqOUt1Q0JpMVN3cUV1YXZjQjRIdFIyMTExN1RDZnMyQTVTWFZGVkJRazFxTQ?oc=5,"Fri, 06 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla is increasing its leasing penetration as its growth in the U.S. stalls and competition from other  electric vehicle  (EV) manufacturers intensifies. Analysts, including Tom Libby of  S&P Global Mobility , observe that companies are driving the surge in leasing due to necessity and their financial capacity.   This shift comes in light of rival automakers leveraging the $7,500 federal lease incentive to offer attractive deals on their EV models.   After significant price cuts over the last two years, along with financing options such as a 0.9% APR for 60 months on the Model Y, leasing has emerged as a promising avenue for Tesla. The company also provides three months of free charging and a trial of its Full Self-Driving software.   Tesla’s increased focus on leasing responds to a decline in both global and U.S. sales. While CEO Elon Musk previously indicated that Tesla would surpass 1.8 million global deliveries, global sales fell by 2.3% in the first three quarters of 2024, with U.S. registrations down by 7.3%.     To strengthen its leasing program, Tesla introduced lease buyouts for the Model 3 and Model Y in November 2024, driven by consumer demand for flexibility. This option contrasts with Tesla’s earlier policy of requiring buyers to return leased vehicles at the end of their terms. It is worth noting that lease buyouts had been previously allowed for the Model S and Model X but were discontinued in 2022. The buyout option now applies across all Tesla models, including the  Cybertruck , which began leasing at $999 per month.   Despite the benefits, leasing EVs carries risks, particularly regarding residual values. Libby warns that predicting future values is challenging due to the short history of EVs in the market and rapidly evolving technology. A study by  iSeeCars  in September 2024 revealed that used EV values fell by 25% from August 2023 to August 2024, compared to a 4% decline for gasoline vehicles. The Tesla Model 3 notably experienced the steepest value drop, highlighting risks as Tesla expands its leasing program.   However, Tesla’s strong financial position enables it to absorb potential losses from increased leasing. The company reported a third-quarter net income of $2.2 billion, an increase of 17% from the previous year, indicating it has the resources to manage the volatility tied to its expanded leasing strategy."

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a letter on Thursday that the recall affects 694,304 cars, including Tesla's Cybertruck, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. According to the  NHTSA , the tire pressure monitoring system on the recalled vehicles ""may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure."" The defect could lead to driving with improperly inflated tires, which can increase the risk of a crash. To resolve the issue, Tesla is releasing an over-the-air (OTA) software update to owners, free of charge. Three Tesla models recalled According to the NHTSA, Tesla's number for this recall is SB-24-00-018. Notification letters will be sent to drivers by Feb. 15, 2025. Recalled vehicles: 2017-2025 Tesla Model 3 2020-2025 Tesla Model Y 2024 Tesla Cybertruck Maintaining proper tire pressure is an important part of vehicle safety, especially in  winter conditions . In cold weather, tire pressure can drop by one PSI for every 10 degrees. Underinflated tires can affect braking distance, steering, and handling. Tesla recalls in 2024 The electric vehicle manufacturer has dealt with multiple other recalls this year, including seven separate recalls for its Cybertruck model. In November, 2,431  Cybertruck  models were recalled due to a faulty drive inverter that could cause loss of drive power to the wheels and increase the risk of a crash. In July, nearly  1.85 million  Tesla models were recalled because of concerns over a hood issue that could cause the vehicle's driver to crash. Tesla also  recalled  over 2 million vehicles in February due to a potential hazard with safety warning signals appearing in a smaller font size. Max Hauptman is a Trending Reporter for USA TODAY.

Tesla Air Ride Service - Brake & Front End,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9NSkU4LVdUNWRwOWF2UzZxakJyVm54MGJ3aERQYzAzZVhkeUh4V1JhM0h4dkFCVld3UFB1MGs0RnR5RDRGWV9EVjBJSGxVZ2hsNkdQOGQ2OWlLdTRWSi1rc3QxV1RCUTQ?oc=5,"Mon, 30 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","The Model S Smart Air Suspension was an option in 2014, and it became standard for all Model S trims from 2017 to mid-2019. The four-corner system is similar to those found on European cars and trucks. The system uses an air compressor, reservoir and valve block that are all mounted in the trunk.       The 2014 and 2015 Model S suspensions use a system made by Continental. The 2016 to 2019 models use an air suspension made by Firestone. Both systems use the same component locations. But, the only fundamental changes between the two systems are how your scan tool connects and how it calibrates, depressurizes and pressurizes the system.   What makes Tesla’s air suspension “smart” is that it uses GPS information and vehicle speed to adjust the suspension ride height. The driver can set GPS waypoints for driveways, rough roads and other locations where the suspension needs to be raised. After a waypoint is set, the car will raise or lower automatically.    The suspension also trims the ride height depending on loads and speed. The system will lower the front at highway speeds to improve aerodynamics. The driver can select four modes manually. For example, if the owner selects very-high mode, the system will reduce the height from very-high to high at 22 mph and from high to standard at 35 mph.   The system has one airline going to each corner unit. The line is connected to the valve block that can exhaust pressure or add pressure to the corner from the reservoir. Most valve blocks have pressure sensors connected to the corner channels and the reservoir. The system can detect a leak by observing the pressure and height changes. The system will also set codes if the compressor run time does not match pressure changes in the reservoir.   Service   Like with any air ride system, you have to perform specific procedures before you can work on the suspension or lift the vehicle. The most common procedure is to put the suspension into jack or service mode before trying to lift the car. For some procedures like strut replacement, you will depressurize the system. This will require a scan tool to actuate the valves in the system.   The other service consideration is the voltage. This system uses the 12-volt system of the vehicle and not the high voltages from the battery pack. You do not have to worry about disconnecting the power system or 12-volt battery.   Most of the connections for the air lines use VOSS connectors. These compression-style fittings use collets and fittings to secure lines. Never reuse collets or fittings.   Nitrogen   The Smart Air System is filled with nitrogen from the factory. Nitrogen gas is more stable and drier than atmospheric air. In addition, the system is not completely sealed and can intake outside air, if required.    Under the access panel will be a Schrader valve that can be used to add nitrogen gas to the system. The valve can be mounted on the upper chassis brace on older models and on the reservoir for newer models. Tesla offers a special tool to connect a tank of nitrogen gas to the system and regulate the pressure between 8-9 bar (118-130 psi). The valve is not directly connected to the bladders on all four corners and will not change ride height. The air is directed first into the reservoir, and the valve block will then distribute the air to the units.   Tesla advises that shop air should not be applied to the service port due to moisture and contamination in compressed air. The system cannot detect whether the air inside the system is nitrogen or shop air.    During the pressurization procedures, the nitrogen tank is connected to the port, and your scan tool will actuate the valves and compressor to fill the system. The Tesla factory tool can select to pressurize the entire system or just one corner. The combo of the scan tool and nitrogen tank can be used to purge the dryer of moisture.    Calibration   After a strut or suspension component has been replaced, it is recommended that the ride height is calibrated. The procedure involves measuring points on the control arms and inputting these values into the scan tool for calibration. The system will calibrate the ride height and pressure sensors.   When calibration procedures are performed, the scan tool will require the door is shut, the windows are up, and the driver’s seat belt is buckled. You can trick the door switch by rolling the lock mechanism in the door.   If you can repair an air suspension on a domestic or import nameplate vehicle, you can service the air suspension on a Tesla Model S. You need the service information, which is now available at no charge for technicians. Next, you will need a factory or aftermarket scan tool to interface with the air suspension control module. The factory subscription for Tesla’s Toolbox will cost you $3,000 for 12 months. But, some aftermarket scan tools now offer Tesla coverage. Last, you need the tools to top off the nitrogen in the system."

Elon Musk's more than $50 billion pay deal at Tesla was rejected again.

A federal judge this week ruled that Musk's $50 billion pay package from Tesla cannot be reinstated.                                                            Allison Robbert-Pool/Getty Images                                         hide caption       toggle caption                       Allison Robbert-Pool/Getty Images                     A judge has again rejected a more than $50 billion compensation package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, granting a victory to the shareholder who opposed the pay amount.   In a ruling on Monday, Delaware Court of Chancery Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick said Musk and his attorneys had ""no procedural ground for flipping"" her previous decision in January that struck down his pay package.   Here is what you need to know about the case.   This started in 2018   Monday's decision was just the latest twist in a long-running saga over Musk's pay at Tesla. It's a legal fight that dates back to 2018, when Tesla shareholders  approved  a 10-year performance-based pay package for Musk.    The compensation package was set up as a series of 12 milestones, each unlocking more compensation as Tesla continued to grow. Under the plan, Musk wouldn't earn a salary, but would instead receive additional Tesla shares the more the company grew.    At the time, many thought it was absurd that Musk would ever hit the targets spelled out in the plan, as the package effectively required Musk to supercharge Tesla's valuation more than 10 times over.    Still, the plan drew pushback from at least some Tesla shareholders, including Richard Tornetta, who objected to the compensation package and filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla in 2018.    In his suit, Tornetta alleged that Musk exercised outsized influence with the board when it crafted the plan and that investors were misled when they were asked to approve it.    Musk has pushed back against those allegations, denying at trial that he dictated terms of the pay package or attended meetings where it was discussed.    Lawyers for Tornetta on Monday praised McCormick's decision and said the ruling ""declined Tesla's invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings.""   Why so much money?   Attorneys for Musk have argued that the massive pay package was approved by shareholders and that his extraordinary compensation was tied to ""extraordinarily ambitious"" performance targets. According to the compensation plan that was announced in 2018, in order for Musk to meet the first milestone, Tesla's market cap had to go up to $100 billion.   ""For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion,"" the company said.   Since then, the company has faced a number of  setbacks , including slowing growth in EV sales and increasing scrutiny from regulators. But Tesla has also grown significantly. Today, the company is valued at over $1 trillion.   But the company's accomplishments were not enough to sway McCormick, who in  January ruled  that Musk was not entitled to the pay package. In her opinion, McCormick called the process leading to the plan's approval ""deeply flawed,"" citing Musk's role as a controlling shareholder at Tesla as a potential conflict of interest.   A CEO's superstar status can make even a truly independent director ""likely to be unduly deferential"" and creates a ""'distortion field' that interferes with board oversight,"" she wrote in her January opinion.   What the judge says about why she has struck down the pay package   Hoping to sway the judge, Tesla's board took the pay package back to shareholders for a second time this past  June  — winning that vote with a whopping 72% majority.    But it was still not enough to change McCormick's mind.    Not only did McCormick strike down the compensation plan for a second time on Monday, she awarded Tornetta $345 million for legal fees that can be paid with either cash or Tesla shares. Plaintiffs had asked for $5.6 billion, but the judge called that a ""bold ask.""   McCormick has invited Tesla to create a new package for Musk, but the June vote did not represent a new plan, but rather ratification of the original agreement.    As with her earlier ruling, McCormick again expressed concern about Musk's control and influence over the company, including its board.   ""There were undoubtedly a range of healthy amounts that the Board could have decided to pay Musk,"" McCormick wrote, but she said the board instead ""capitulated to Musk's terms and then failed to prove that those terms were entirely fair.""   McCormick also said no Delaware court had ever reversed its judgment based on a stockholder vote that took place after a trial and noted that if companies could ""create"" new facts after a judgment was reached that ""lawsuits would become interminable.""   What will happen next?   Attorney's for Musk did not respond to a request for comment, but  writing on X , the social media platform he owns, Musk said, ""shareholders should control company votes, not judges.""   Tesla also called the court's decision ""wrong"" in a post on X and said it would appeal. That appeal would likely be filed in the Delaware Supreme Court.   ""This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs' lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners – the shareholders,"" the  company wrote  Monday evening.   Attorneys for the Tesla shareholders who opposed Musk's pay said they would defend the court's ""thoughtful and well-grounded opinions"" if the ruling is appealed.   NPR's Camila Domonoske contributed to this report."

McMahill said at a news conference late Wednesday that he doesn’t know if the events in the two tourism capitals are related. “But what I can tell you is we’re absolutely investigating any connectivity to what happened with New Orleans, as well as other attacks.”   Musk  posted on X  that the two vehicles were rented from the same online company.    Pres. Joe Biden, in a televised address Wednesday, confirmed officials are investigating a link between the incidents.    FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeremy Schwartz said the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, which is made up of federal and local law enforcement, is working to determine the identity of the driver, and whether the explosion was an act of terrorism.    “We believe this is an isolated incident,” Schwartz said. “We do not believe that there’s a bunch of folks out there supporting this or helping, and don’t believe that there’s any other danger to the community right now.”   Law enforcement is also investigating whether the type of vehicle rented and the location of the explosion were intentional.    “It’s a Tesla truck,” McMahill said at the news conference, where he was flanked by state and local officials, including Attorney General Aaron Ford. “We know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it’s the Trump Tower. So there’s obviously things to be concerned about there.”    The bed of the Cybertruck was laden with mortar-style fireworks, gas cans and other explosives, according to McMahill, who says he’s unaware of how they were detonated.    Law enforcement, he said, cannot yet identify the driver “with 100% certainty.”  The individual was killed in the blast, which was captured on hotel security video. He also declined to release the name of the individual who rented the truck in Colorado, pending confirmation and notification of relatives.    VIDEO     License plate readers detected the truck in Las Vegas around 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, about an hour before it pulled into valet parking at the Trump International Hotel and exploded about 15 seconds later, McMahill said. He thanked Tesla founder Elon Musk for assisting law enforcement by providing information and video from charging stations along the truck’s route from Colorado.   He also praised the vehicle’s engineering, which “limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet” because the force of the blast went upward, not outward, and did not break the hotel entrance’s glass doors.    McMahill said a review of security procedures on the Las Vegas Strip, which hosted some 400,000 New Year’s revelers hours before the blast, is in order.   “We were very successful the night before,” McMahill said.“I’m surprised this happened, to be quite frank with you, and that’s certainly something we’re going to have to look at and target.”    “I just want to make sure that our community understands we believe this would be an isolated incident, and it is now over, as far as the danger,” he said, but added that out of an abundance of caution he’s extending his New Year’s staffing plan of 1,000 officers in the tourism corridor and the community.    Gov. Joe Lombardo, who McMahill succeeded as sheriff, was not at the news conference. His spokeswoman declined via email to say whether Lombardo believes security protocols on the Strip should be reviewed.     Note: This story was updated to include Lombardo’s refusal to respond to the Current’s inquiry about security.     Last updated 3:49 p.m., Jan. 2, 2025"

That's what this  Tesla Model X  owner thought. Won't my car look great with Christmas lights? This owner  @platinumxcenter  shows his  Tesla  Model X, which is covered with those small strings of lights that are designed from a tree, not a car.    The only way to attach the strings of lights is to use tape. So he works for over an hour meticulously taping the lights on his $100,000  Tesla Model X , which he loves. He made sure they were spaced correctly, so it looked great driving down the street.    He laments, ""RIP to my $100,000 car,"" he writes in the text overlaying the video. ""Who let me do this, and why did no one tell me this was going to happen?"" His regret is understandable, and it's a cautionary tale for all car owners.    Further on, he shows himself removing pieces of tape from the expensive luxury Tesla. However, there is a big problem. Every piece of tape he removes leaves a thick, sticky residue on the vehicle.    ""I'm going to have fun taking these off for sure,"" he says with remorse.    In another Christmas car lights gone wrong, Ella Palen ( @ellapalen ) wants to surprise her boyfriend, who owns an  Audi R8 V10  sports car. The  Audi  R8 is a $150,000 supercar; as you can imagine, it's her boyfriend's pride and joy.    Ella gets the idea to put Christmas lights on his expensive sports car while he's taking a nap. She will have the car covered in Christmas lights when he gets up. And he will love it. Or so she hopes.     She spends over an hour taping the lights to his blue sports car and thinks it looks great when she's done. She looks at her tape job with a big smile.    Here is what happened next.     Ella says, ""Today, I'm taping Christmas lights all over my boyfriend's supercar. I'm really hoping that this tape doesn't ruin his rap. Sorry, but I don't think his rap is very good anyway.""    Ella takes her time and puts the strands of lights on the Audi sports car's sides, roof, and hood. She steps back and looks at the car.    She says next, Okay, I just finished with all the lights. Now, I will turn it on; I even covered the carbon fiber on the hood,"" she says excitedly.   Ella starts the car, and the V10 engine roars as she hits the gas. Now it's time to wake up her boyfriend from his nap.    Her boyfriend wakes up, puts his coat on, and looks like, ""Oh, no."" Ella says, ""I did something. But you can't be mad. Promise you won't be mad?""    ""I'm not promising,"" he says.    Ella takes her boyfriend outside to look at his expensive supercar, which is covered in lights. She covers his eyes as they walk, and then she gives him the big reveal.   She says, ""Tada!"" He is shocked when he looks at his $150,000 sports car. His eyes widen, and he says, ""Whoa,"" and then can't believe what she's done to his car.   Her boyfriend's disappointment is evident. ""But you're not…You can't put tape on a car, baby."" He walks around his car, shaking his head. The disappointment is tangible, and it's a lesson learned the hard way.    However, Ella doesn't realize yet what she's done and says, ""Why not? Let's drive it. Let's go. Yeah!""   He turns and looks at Ella with a sad face and says, ""The lights are gonna fall off. You just can't drive fast."" He can't hide the shock he's feeling.    How did this Christmas car lights story gone bad end?   I can only imagine that when he took the lights off, the Audi R8's paint was ruined, and he had to get a new paint job. I don't know if Ella is still his girlfriend after this mishap.     Should you ever tape Christmas lights to a car?   It's crucial to understand that driving with Christmas lights on your car  is illegal in most U.S. states , and offenders can face fines of up to $1,000. The legal consequences are severe, and it's not worth the risk.    According to  Ultra Bright Lightz , a leading provider of decorative lighting solutions, ""Driving with Christmas lights on your car is illegal in most U.S. states when on public roads. These decorative lights typically violate vehicle lighting laws that restrict colors and types of lights permitted on vehicles. The only exceptions are during sanctioned parades with proper permits or while the vehicle is stationary on private property.""   Conclusion:   Remember, it's not just about the potential damage to your car, but also the legal consequences and safety risks. So, for the sake of your car, your wallet, and your holiday spirit, resist the urge to decorate your car, or your boyfriend's $150,000 supercar with Christmas lights.    If you do, you won't have a Happy Holiday.    How about you?

"Tesla Model Q: Are the rumors about the new, affordable Tesla true? - Mashable",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVEFVX3lxTE1ueGNHd1BlanJVYWtUa1pzWUtKbGtvZGltakpaSXpQR3JKSTlvajR1ZkpWRkhPZkJ5ZDM3QktLMERmNVhzV0VnTGJ4TUdvLTlBNElVMA?oc=5,"Tue, 10 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Will  Tesla 's new, affordable electric vehicle be called Tesla Model Q? Don't hold your breath for the name, but a cheaper Tesla is, apparently, coming. A Deutsche Bank report mentions the new model and claims the car will launch in the first half of 2025, with a starting price under $30,000.    According to  GlobalChinaEV , Travis Axelrod (Teslaa's Head of Investor Relations) talked about the vehicle with Deutsche Bank. The report claims that the car – codenamed ""Redwood"" – will be 15 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than Tesla's Model 3, and that it will cost Tesla about half as much to manufacture.  The report also mentions two battery configurations for the car (53kWh and 75kWh), as well as single- and dual-motor variants.    Take these details with a grain of salt. The Wall Street Journal's  Becky Peterson  claims she saw a copy of the Deutsche Bank report. She does confirm that Axelrod discussed the new Tesla with Deutsche Bank (Model Q seems to be Deutsche Bank's name for the car, not Tesla's). She also claims that the new car will be built on Tesla's existing production lines, and that it will cost less than $30,000 with subsidies (meaning that the actual starting price would be $37,499).   But Peterson says that the report does not contain any details about the car's size, cost, or that it will built on Redwood, which is Tesla's internal code name for a mass market vehicle built on a new platform which was paused by Musk earlier in 2024.    When laid out like this, the report doesn't really bring much new to the table, given that Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said a  cheaper Tesla is coming in the first half of 2025 , without revealing any additional details. Musk also specifically said that a non-Robotaxi Tesla car that costs $25,000 will not happen.  Where does all this leave us? Well, mostly where we were before. Despite Musk's own AI Grok already  claiming  that Tesla has ""announced the upcoming launch of the Model Q,"" nothing new has been officially announced. Yes, a more affordable Tesla seems to be coming next year, but it's unclear whether it'll be an entirely new model or just a cheaper Model 3."

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and Clark County Fire Department officials told a news conference that a person died inside the futuristic-looking truck, and they were working to get the body out. Seven people nearby had minor injuries and several were taken to a hospital.   The fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m., a county spokesperson said in a statement.   According to a law enforcement official, the truck was rented via the Turo app and appeared to have a load of fireworks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.       Flames rise from a Tesla Cybertruck after it exploded outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jan. 1, 2025 in this screengrab taken from a social media video. ( Antunes via Reuters)         A Turo spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.   Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday afternoon on X that ""we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.""   ""The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,"" Musk said in an earlier post on the platform after attending a New Year's Eve party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. ""We've never seen anything like this.""   Law enforcement officials have not ruled out terrorism as a possible motive, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.   ""I know you have a lot of questions,"" Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge for the FBI's Las Vegas office, told reporters. ""We don't have a lot of answers.""   President Joe Biden was briefed on the explosion. The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police.   In Las Vegas, witness Ana Bruce, visiting from Brazil, said she heard three explosions.   ""The first one where we saw the fire, the second one, I guess, was the battery or something like that, and the third was the big one that smoked the entire area and was the moment when everyone was told to evacuate and stay away,"" Bruce said.   The 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.   Eric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media platform X. He praised the fire department and local law enforcement ""for their swift response and professionalism."""

Tesla sales in Australia are sliding for the first time. Is it stiff competition or the Musk factor? - The Guardian,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxPSnEwUExnV01rVnpKWXBncDhIdlVteDFXaEJzMHZfQ2FYLTNJcUJUOHNGZmlhQk5iRFpPM281N3NiU3h2aklDMHpYdHJ5QlNRZnFvcmlqN2RjZlVtQVFvSHVSZTJWSXFZUmtld21vOEE1cUxOU1JwQ3lxN2RyMW5VZGJzdEZMY3pZTmpaRWE1WElKX01nN29SS21SaGNfUTBNN21RYktJSGZyZk1xQVNHVUs2TzZuQ2hab2Z5MUNUd2V1NEo3bE43cmZEa0RRMk9JcXctRGZPemI?oc=5,"Fri, 06 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Elon Musk may be riding high in the US with Donald Trump just weeks away from taking office, but fortunes of his electric carmaker,  Tesla , are fading in Australia. Australian sales dropped again in November, contributing to the brand’s first annual decline. Tesla registered 2,540 sales in November, according to figures supplied by the Electric Vehicle Council. That’s a 35.5% drop compared with November 2023 and contributes to a 20.9% sales slide for the brand year to date. Globally, Tesla still remains just in front of its chief rival, Chinese automaker BYD,  with 18.5% of the market compared with BYD’s 17.5% . Mike Costello, the corporate affairs manager at Cox Automotive, which runs Manheim Auctions and collates car market data, says the EV sector is evolving quickly and to some extent Tesla is caught in the upheaval. “There’s a lot more competition than there used to be and there’s not a lot of new product coming out of Tesla, particularly at that more affordable end,” says Costello. That competition includes EVs from mainstream brands such as Ford, Toyota, Subaru, Kia, MG and Hyundai as well as a plethora of recently arrived or soon-to-arrive Chinese brands that include BYD, Deepal, Leapmotor, Xpeng, Zeekr and Geely. Sales of hybrids – led by Toyota – are also surging and providing an alternative that’s often more affordable than an EV. All of which has put pressure on the EV market. EV sales are still up for the first 11 months of 2024, but only by 3.1% – just 2,514 sales – according to figures supplied by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and EV Council. Of the 82,960 EVs sold so far this year 42% of them – 34,754 – were Teslas. The bulk of the EV growth has come from newcomer BYD, which has sold 13,389 EVs, 2,414 more than last year. But some customers are also looking to other brands, including Kia, which has sold an additional 900-odd EVs this year. BMW is also pushing hard on EVs, with 30% of its Australian sales now fully electric. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You don’t have to venture far on social media to find those who see Musk as an objectionable character. Costello says Musk is controversial enough  to be turning some off the brand. It’s spawned  a niche online market in bumper stickers , from “we bought it before he revealed his dark side” to “make this car less embarrassing again”. But before writing Telsa off altogether, it’s worth keeping the sales numbers in perspective. “Tesla’s product lineup is still quite small and it’s getting on a bit in age,” Costello says. The company only sells two models: the Model 3 mid-sized sedan and Model Y mid-sized SUV. The two models play in the premium end of the market, priced from about $60,000, but each performs strongly in its respective market segment. The Model 3, for example, was the top selling medium car last year and is still ahead of the Toyota Camry in 2024. It’s single-handedly breathed new life into the mid-sized sedan market that many had abandoned (Subaru Liberty, Ford Mondeo and Volkswagen Passat among them). Sales of the Model Y have dropped 29.3% this year but its 19,392 year-to-date tally is light years ahead of the nearest $60,000-plus SUV rival, the Lexus NX, with 5,619 sales. And of about 50 mid-sized SUVs on the market the Model Y is the fifth-bestseller, behind only the Toyota RAV4 (53,599), Mitsubishi Outlander (25,622), Mazda CX-5 (21,237) and Kia Sportage (19,997). It has outsold the Hyundai Tucson (17,743), Subaru Forester (12,386) and Nissan X-Trail (15,398) and the combined sales of the Honda CR-V, Volkswagen Tiguan, Skoda Karoq, Chery Tiggo 7 and MG HS. The increasing popularity of hybrids with many of those rivals has provided healthy competition to the Model Y, which is expected to undergo a refresh in 2025."

"USD 25000 ‘Tesla Model 2’ or ‘Model Q’ project canceled, or is it? - TopElectricSUV",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFA4YUNYTnlOcFZ3U2ZuSy1rZUpPcWE2RUNlRXBDbjB2MkVncXZIVXFFV1NreTQ4X2ZiRlljR09IME1mYUpSSzB3cVhoaEdqMHV3MEtvQ2RvREdPS0ZROUpUQVl4ZGhOaTgyWWUyWXM5dFJxMlp2d3c?oc=5,"Mon, 16 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Update: ‘Sub-30k Tesla Model Q to arrive in 2025?’ section included to the end of the story.   The USD 25,000 Tesla EV might no longer be happening, in what would arguably be the biggest U-turn from the world’s most prominent electric carmaker. Rumored to be called ‘Tesla Model 2’ or ‘Tesla Model Q,’ the entry-level compact EV is said to be canceled from the pipeline. However, recent developments indicate the Tesla Model Q could still be on the cards, but in a slightly higher price band.   It was back in August 2018 when Tesla first started saying it could launch a USD 25,000 car. In an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee (MKBHD), co-founder and CEO Elon Musk said (via  YouTube ), “I think in order for us to get to like, let’s say, ultimately getting like a USD 25,000 car, that’s something we could do.”   On various occasions since, Tesla indicated it would launch a USD 25,000 EV, and a driverless variant of the same. However, during the company’s Q4 2021 earnings conference call on January 26, 2022, Musk revealed the company had paused work on the former. The latter, initially referred to as ‘Tesla Robotaxi,’ broke cover as the ‘Tesla Cybercab’ two-door, two-seat coupe in October 2024.         Rendering artist Sugarchow shows how the Tesla Model 2/Model Q would look like if it was a compact hatchback. Image Source: Instagram/sugardesign_1   On March 1, 2023, Tesla announced it would manufacture its next-gen vehicle at a new plant in Mexico, and it was widely anticipated that this referred to the USD 25,000 EV. The company planned to make the next-gen EV initially at Giga Texas, though, starting in H2 2025, Musk revealed during the Q4 2023 earnings conference call on January 24, 2024.    Reuters  stated ‘Redwood’ as this product’s codename in an exclusive story the same day. According to a follow-up report  Reuters  released on November 6, 2023, Tesla was going to make this EV at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg as well.   On April 5, 2024,  Reuters  published another exclusive claiming that Tesla had scrapped the manually-driven USD 25,000 EV and plans to launch only its fully autonomous variant (Tesla Cybercab). After the company’s stock took a hit because of this development, Musk responded on  X  saying “Reuters is lying.”   Fast-forward to October 23, 2024, Musk called the $25,000 car “pointless” during the Q3 2024 earnings conference call, indicating the company has indeed scrapped the long-promised conventional high-volume model, and was directing its energy towards launching the Cybercab.     I think having a regular 25k model is pointless. It would be silly. Like, it would be completely at odds with what we believe.   Elon Musk, co-founder and CEO, Tesla (Tesla Q3 2024 earnings conference call on October 23, 2024)   The Tesla Cybercab is envisioned as a fully autonomous two-door coupe designed to carry two passengers without a driver. Image Source: Tesla   Tesla plans to build the Cybercab in two factories and aims to make at least two million units of the self-driving EV annually. The company plans to start its production in 2026 and launch it at a price of under USD 30,000 (including incentives).   Sub-30k Tesla Model Q to arrive in 2025?   On December 9, 2024, citing a Deutsche Bank report, The Wall Street Journal reporter Becky Peterson said on  X  that Tesla plans to launch a Model Q in the first half of 2025. Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations at Tesla, reportedly met with Deutsche Bank for its Autonomous Driving Day on December 5, 2024, in New York City, where the product was discussed.   Citing the report, Peterson added that Tesla would make the entry-level car at a current factory on an existing production line. The company aims to price the new model under USD 30,000 (including the USD 7,500 clean vehicle tax credit). There’s no mention of a Tesla Redwood in the report, though.

8 big changes to watch out for in the 2025 Tesla Model Y (Juniper) - TopElectricSUV,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9YdDBvNW8wamoxczg0VkxaUVRwemtMaHcybk93Q2NTeVRjRkp4OFNERTd5ekpJRjg2bDU3UVpwRkItYm1nYWRRRWRhNTh0X3ZpbnUyOHRidm9MS2s4c005dGQ0VjBvWkxyZUtZdkxhM3lYM1pQaVl5MmgyNXRzWDA?oc=5,"Wed, 25 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Topping EV sales charts in many key markets globally, and proving to be the benchmark in its segment, the  Tesla Model Y  is at the heart of the electric car revolution. In early 2025, about five years following its world premiere, it is set to receive its first facelift with exterior, interior, and equipment changes.   Here are 8 big changes that we expect in the  2025 Tesla Model Y (codename: Tesla Juniper) :   Sharper Styling   In line with Tesla’s new design language, seen on the  Cybertruck  and  Cybercab , the Model Y would adopt an edgier look. Central to this facelift would be split headlights with a daytime running light band spanning the width at the leading edge of the hood, and a separate rectangular housing in the mid-outer part of the bumper integrating the low- and high-beam lights.         TopElectricSUV’s exclusive renderings of the Model Y facelift previews the changes coming to the front and rear fascias.    At the back, prototypes show auxiliary brake lights in the bumper. The taillights would also be sharper and are expected to be connected via a light band, as represented in our exclusive renderings found in this story.   New Colors   Tesla will likely offer at least two new paint options for the Model Y Juniper, possibly the  Ultra Red  and  Stealth Gray  shades, borrowed from the  new Model 3 ‘s palette.   New Dashboard & Lighting   The refreshed Model Y is almost certain to feature a redesigned dashboard that transitions neatly into the door panels, as seen in the 2024 Model 3. New ambient lighting is also expected to improve the minimalistic cabin’s lounge-like vibe.     Improved Comfort   Softer, more refined materials should increase the sense of comfort and luxury. These new ventilated seats and reduced NVH from the new tires and 360º acoustic glass, are expected to further improve comfort.   New ‘Screens’   Tesla is likely to replace the Model Y’s 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system with a 15.4-inch unit in the upcoming refresh. A report  Notebookcheck  published on December 23, 2024, said that the new display could have a higher, 2.5K resolution, showing information in better detail. Moreover, the company should add an 8-inch touchscreen in the back, allowing rear-seat passengers to access climate controls and watch videos, as seen in the 2024 Model 3 (shown below).           New Motors   According to the Notebookcheck report, Tesla will employ its all-new, fourth-generation electric motors which are compact and more efficient than the current powertrain. If the report is accurate, the upgrade should reduce weight and energy consumption, leading to a notably improved range.   Upgraded Battery   The facelifted Tesla Model Y will have a bigger, 95 kWh battery pack in the Long Range and Performance variants, as per the same Notebookcheck report. The Long Range variant, which delivers an EPA-estimated range of up to 363 miles in the current model, could travel up to nearly 400 miles with this upgrade.   Long-wheelbase Variant   On August 29, 2024, Chinese publication  LatePost  reported that Tesla will offer the new Model Y in China in a three-row configuration, likely from Q4 2025 (October-December 2025). On September 3, 2024, Reuters had reported that the company will provide Chinese customers a more comfort-oriented 6-seat configuration as well, a first for any market worldwide.   Reuters ’ sources indicated that the 6-seat configuration could have a longer wheelbase, saying Chinese customers would find the third row of the current 7-seat configuration cramped. While this version is being touted as a China-only affair, Tesla is expected to continue making the seven-seat option for the U.S. with the facelift.

iSeeCars study reveals Tesla tops fatal accident rate - CBT News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTFdMejh1MWFIRWVJTDVLWEF3NDc3QTJRY0VhWWhuWU5XR2N5YVB4VXctWDNXcUFfbC1vUFBfUmlnQVIyWktPcHRrT1ZIZmdkNUJFRFA1M1ZLaEg4MGFhUEZSU3BfbjIwNWI0bEhScmVMelMtQXlldVhnMV9XUUlkaTB2c0w?oc=5,"Fri, 06 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Despite Tesla’s reputation for producing some of the safest vehicles on the road, a recent study by  iSeeCars  reveals that  Tesla  models lead in fatal accident rates in the U.S. from 2017 to 2022, with an average of 5.6 fatalities per billion vehicle miles.   The Data Breakdown   The study utilized the U.S. Fatality Analysis Reporting System and highlights the following:     Tesla models: 5.6 fatalities per billion vehicle miles   Industry average: 2.9 fatalities per billion vehicle miles   Other brands with notable fatality rates include:     Kia: 5.5   Buick: 4.8   Dodge: 4.4         In addition, Tesla’s Model Y ranked sixth among individual models with the most frequent occupant fatalities, at 10.6 fatalities per billion miles, which is 3.7 times the industry average.   Top Cars with Highest Fatality Rates   The top car models identified in the study include:       Hyundai Venue : 13.9 fatalities per billion miles ( 4.9 times the industry average )   Chevrolet Corvette : 13.6 ( 4.8 times the industry average )   Mitsubishi Mirage : 13.6 ( 4.8 times the industry average )   Porsche 911 : 13.2 ( 4.6 times the industry average )   Honda CR-V Hybrid : 13.2 ( 4.6 times the industry average )     According to iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer, Tesla’s elevated fatality rates might reflect driver behavior more than vehicle design. Many vehicles on the list, including Tesla models, perform exceptionally in crash tests conducted by the  IIHS  and  NHTSA , suggesting they are not inherently unsafe. Factors like risky driving habits, inattention, or over-reliance on Autopilot could contribute to the statistics.   Another critical factor is vehicle size. Subcompact and compact vehicles, including Tesla’s smaller models, dominate the fatality list, whereas midsize and full-size cars generally fall below the industry average. This disparity underscores the laws of physics—smaller cars face greater risks in collisions with larger vehicles.   SUVs with High Fatality Rates   Among SUVs, the average is 2.2 fatalities per billion miles. For Tesla’s Model Y, it ranks third at 10.6 fatalities per billion miles, trailing only:     Hyundai Venue: 13.9 fatalities ( 6.3 times the industry SUV average )   Honda CR-V Hybrid: 13.2 ( 5.9 times the industry SUV average )   Buick Encore GX (9.8  times the industry SUV average )   Buick Envision (8.0  times the industry SUV average )     This data reminds auto dealers and manufacturers to consider not only vehicle safety design but also driver education and behavior. For Tesla and others, addressing misconceptions about Autopilot’s capabilities and promoting responsible usage could mitigate risks. As the industry moves toward more advanced driver-assistance systems, balancing technology with driver accountability remains a pressing challenge."

More?                Revolt Systems on YouTube         Old cars with modern drivetrains are  often terrible . People go too far in their  restomods , turning classic  muscle cars  into the automotive equivalent of those  LED-ridden black leather couches . But what if you wanted to deck out a classic car with modern power in a way that wasn't cringe as hell? Well, you might chop up an AC Cobra and stuff a Tesla Plaid drivetrain in it.   This Cobra, built up by owner Dan Swadley, claims to be the first Plaid-converted Cobra in the world. I can't really imagine that many other builders are competing for that title, but it's nice to know we have a first.   VIDEO   My favorite part of this build isn't even the acceleration. At some point, raw acceleration gets old, and you just start worrying about the law catching notice. No, the best part of this Cobra is how it looks — absolutely beat to hell, slapped together with mismatched metal just to fill the gaps.   This rat rod look is perfect for the kind of hacked-up roadster that a Tesla-powered Cobra necessarily is. Those drivetrain components don't fit the car as delivered by AC, it needs to be heavily modified just to make space for everything. Why not show that off, reveal every added panel and each individual weld? This Cobra owns what it is, and that makes it all the better.   Other restomod makers, take note. EV power is fantastic, visibly chopped up old cars are fantastic, and the combination thereof is the best way to make your resotmod. Enough with the black leather couches, make more of this.   h/t InsideEVs"

The American automaker is still in its infancy compared to legacy brands like Ford and General Motors, but is has accomplished huge achievements in the last half-decade of vehicle production. Tesla produces two of the best-selling EVs on the planet: the  Tesla Model 3  electric sedan and the  Tesla Model Y  electric SUV.    Its popular models are very different from the. The company has moved away from performance-oriented sports cars to focus on more practical mainstream vehicles that display impressive performance specs in final configurations. Between the production of practical and appealing electric vehicles and the establishment of the                 world's largest network of fast chargers  , the brand has successfully dominated the EV space. Tesla's Model Y comes in three trims including the affordable Long Range base model, the Long Range AWD mid-range model, and the Performance final trim. The small electric SUV is a sales sensation for a reason.             In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla and other authoritative sources.               Related     This is how much you can expect to sell your Model Y for after three years of ownership.              1                                 The Tesla Model Y Achieves An Estimated 337 Miles Of Driving Range                          Do you have  range anxiety ? Part of the reason thousands of drivers choose new internal combustion engine vehicles over electric vehicles is because of range anxiety. Range anxiety is the fear of losing battery capacity and being left stranded without a way to charge your EV. Imagine running out of gas with no gas station nearby. Tesla is fighting range anxiety on two fronts. First, it produces vehicles with plenty of driving range. Second, the company continues to build upon the renowned Tesla Supercharger network.    The base model 2024 Tesla Model Y Long Range achieves an EPA-estimated 337 miles of driving range. That's quite a good range by today's standards. Couple that spec with access to the                 world's largest fast-charging network   and you've got a recipe for success. Even the EV with the least range, the Model Y Performance, achieves 277 miles of driving range on a fully charged battery. EVs still may have a ways to go before they're considered practical by the masses, but the Model Y Long Range gets as close to practicality as any  affordable electric vehicle  as far as range goes.         2                                 Advanced Semi-Autonomous Driving Capabilities                                              Tesla          Tesla is one of the first automakers to focus on advanced cruise control capabilities that it refers to as semi-autonomous driving. Note that you should never divert your attention from operating a vehicle regardless of how advanced it may be. That said, Tesla has developed some of the most intuitive semi-autonomous driving software available. As a result, Tesla Model Ys have a traffic-aware cruise control feature that adjusts your driving speed to safely follow the vehicle in front of you on highways. The small electric SUVs also include a lane-centering feature that keeps them from exiting your selected lane.   You can automatically change lanes by turning the turn signal to your desired lane. Furthermore, the Model Y is able to move in and out of parking spaces when directed.             Tesla Autopilot Subscription Packages       Pricing           Basic Autopilot To FSD (Supervised)       $99.00/Month           Enhanced Autopilot To FSD (Supervised)       $99.00/Month             According to  Tesla , Enhanced Autopilot is only available in select markets.         ""Your vehicle's current Autopilot package of Basic Autopilot or Enhanced Autopilot will determine the FSD (Supervised) subscription price, which is subject to change."" ~Tesla           FSD stands for ""full-self driving""   which is Tesla's OEM terminology for its suite of semi-autonomous driving features. The most advanced capabilities are reserved for the FSD subscription which could will run you $1,188 a year before taxes and additional fees. This subscription makes driving your Model Y small electric SUV as easy as possible.       Tesla's FSD capabilities have faced plenty of scrutiny and criticism, but it's tough to deny how cool the features are. After all, how often do you encounter a vehicle that can practically drive itself?     3                                 Accelerates From 0-60 MPH In 3.5 Seconds                          ​​​​​​                       Tesla          Practicality isn't the only issue that EVs face regarding mass adoption. Another stigma electric vehicles battle is the belief that they lack satisfying performance. The Model Y Performance trim shatters that stigma with its amazing acceleration rate. It rockets from  0-60 miles per hour in just 3.5 seconds . It's one of the quickest SUVs on the market, outperforming much more expensive internal combustion engine models like the  2024 Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio .   The Tesla Model Y Long Range base model accelerates from 0-60 miles per hour in 6.5 seconds. Tesla's all-wheel drive iteration zooms from 0-60 miles per hour in 4.8 seconds. It's fun to drive thanks to its power and agility.         Related     This is how much you can expect to spend when the time comes to replace your Tesla Model Y's battery             4                                 The Model Y Has Plenty Of Cabin And Cargo Space                                              Tesla          The Tesla Model Y has adequate interior space for most small families. It has lots of space in its cargo area as well, making it a great choice for folks who regularly utilize trunk space. It even has  additional space in the frunk  for storing items.                Interior Dimensions                      Front        Rear           Headroom       41 Inches       39 Inches           Leg Room        41 Inches       40 Inches           Shoulder Room        56 Inches       54 Inches           Hip Room        53 Inches       50 Inches           Front Trunk        4.1 Cubic Feet       N/A           Behind First Row (Second Row Folded)       72.1 Cubic Feet       N/A           Behind Second Row (All Seats In Place)       30.2 Cubic Feet       N/A             The Model Y's second row of seats is ideal for children, but it has enough room for most adults to be comfortable for short periods of time. It has a power liftgate to make loading and unloading the cargo area easier.     5                                 The Long Range Trim Achieves 122 MPGe Combined                                              Tesla          The Model Y is extremely efficient  from an energy consumption standpoint. The Long Range models achieve 122 miles per gallon equivalent combined. That works out to 127 MPGe in the city and 117 MPGe on the highway. The Performance trim earns 115 MPGe in the city and 106 MPGe on the highway. That's around 110 MPGe combined.   High MPGe (miles per gallon-equivalent) ratings translate to lower recharging costs and more efficient EVs. Furthermore, they ensure electric vehicles have less destructive environmental impacts than some inefficient internal combustion engine vehicles. The Tesla Model Y's efficiency is a net positive for owners and the planet.

This isn't an immediate discount, but it means a significantly lower annual tax expenditure for many and could result in cash back via your tax returns. So, technically, every new 2024 Model Y's starting price is $7,500 lower than its MSRP.

The  Trump administration  could get rid of EV incentives in 2025. So, this may be your last chance to get a Model Y at an extremely reduced price. Is the 2024 Model Y the last Model Y that will ever cost under $40K as a new model?         Related     The Tesla Model Y is a dominant force in the EV market, but how does it compare against these 10 popular hybrid compact crossover SUVs on the market?             7                                 There's A Quick And Extensive Supercharger Network                                              Tesla          There are over 60,000  Tesla Superchargers  in the brand's international  Supercharger network . Some of these chargers can replenish up to 200 miles of range in as little as fifteen minutes. Additionally charging a Tesla at a Tesla charging station is more affordable than refueling most gas vehicles at a gas station. Despite different regional incentives and economic climates, Tesla has established charging thousands of stations on both the east and west coasts of the United States.   Charging an EV is arguably the most difficult part of the entire ownership experience. Tesla has simplified this process by creating a massive network of capable chargers. The vehicle can even provide entertainment while charging via games or streaming on the infotainment screen. As demand and sales grow for the company, it's highly likely that it will continue to invest in charging infrastructure. An easy and positive charging experience is one of the"

Judge nixes post-trial ‘ratification’ of Elon Musk’s record Tesla pay package - Legal Dive,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxQMHFMUmdnZGRRcG9BM1VocTM1WWhGdklnT05JVHB3d2x4Y2xMNjhaUm9tdm9mVG9rdm51eTNTUTE1S2Vqd3Fwc1kySFd1bU1oNDNWMGVnM0k4clBHQWhkRTJrVFpJVUhzOTZaa1BVaF9KYzVMamlETU03UExvVUk4djdIeEYxRW9JZE1xOUVKNlhuc0FZdmp4YWowYUx2ZlA2VVdTWG1SNnhTY3MwT3ptMzNfRDJ4Rko1WF9QbHh1cXdMWHhCdEVvWUQxNjFiV184RHd3bFhn?oc=5,"Tue, 03 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Dive Brief:     Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Chancery Court  ruled against  a record pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk for the second time Dec. 2 when she dismissed as baseless a vote the company held earlier this year to show a majority of company shareholders support the package.    Musk and Tesla, she said, “have no procedural ground for flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.”   McCormick also awarded a record $345 million in fees to the prevailing plaintiffs’ counsel. The attorneys had sought fees in Tesla shares that amounted to 10% of the pay package, which would have resulted in compensation for the legal work equal to about $5.6 billion. But McCormick said this was a windfall outside the bounds of reason. “In a case about excessive compensation, that was a bold ask,” she said.     Dive Insight:   McCormick  first ruled against  Musk’s equity-based pay package in January, when it was valued at about $56 billion, on the basis it was put together by Musk himself  —  a conflicted controller  —  and supported by board members in a breach of their fiduciary duty.    This time around, McCormick was responding to a motion by Musk and Tesla to review that earlier decision in light of the  shareholder vote  the company held on the pay package in June to ratify it. In that vote, almost three-quarters of the company’s shareholders said they wanted Musk to get the pay, which would be the largest amount any officer of a publicly traded company has ever received.    In her ruling, McCormick gave multiple reasons why the vote was no reason for reversing her decision.    “The large and talented group of defense firms [working on Musk’s behalf] got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,” she said.    First, there’s no procedural ground for flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence that’s created after trial, she said. Tesla made the request in part under a Chancery Court rule that allows a court to reopen the trial record after a post-trial decision, but that rule is for the introduction of newly discovered evidence, not newly created evidence.    “The Stockholder Vote did not exist at the time of trial,” she said. “Defendants created it after the Post-Trial Opinion.”   Second, Tesla’s effort to present the shareholder vote as common-law ratification came too late, she said. Since common-law ratification is an affirmative defense, it’s a misuse of the defense to raise it for the first time after a post-trial opinion, she said, especially since the shareholder lawsuit against the pay package was brought six years ago. “Wherever the outer boundary of non-prejudicial delay lies, Defendants crossed it,” she said.    Third, Tesla failed to follow the procedural steps that might have allowed the vote to have legal weight as a form of “common law ratification.” For the vote to have had legal weight, the company would have had to set it up under what’s known as the MFW doctrine, which governs procedures for dealing with a conflicted-controller transaction. But it didn’t do that.    MFW is shorthand for a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case,  Kahn v. M&F Worldwide Corp. , which provided ground rules for certain types of transactions involving a controlling shareholder. Musk in this case was deemed a controlling shareholder by the court in its earlier January decision.     “Defendants’ failure to adhere to the framework for securing stockholder ratification in a conflicted-controller context offers an independent basis for rejecting the Ratification Argument,” she said.    Fourth, even if the stockholder vote were to have legal weight, there were material misstatements in the proxy statement that bar the vote from having a ratifying effect.    Among the misstatements, she said, was a claim that the vote would “extinguish claims for breach of fiduciary duty” and correct disclosure deficiencies that were found by the court in the January ruling.   McCormick said any one of the four defects would defeat the company’s motion to revise, but when taken together, “they pack a powerful punch.”   On his X platform,  Musk slammed the decision . “Shareholders should control company votes, not judges,” he said.  Tesla said it would appeal ."

Tesla’s Q1 2025 Results:      Total Revenues: $19.3 billion   Total automotive revenues: $13.967 billion   Total GAAP gross margin: 16.3%   Gross Profit: $3.15 billion   EPS non-GAAP: $0.27 per share   Free cash flow: $664 million     The following are live updates from  Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings  call. I will be updating this article in real time, so please keep refreshing the page to view the latest updates on this story.     16:20 CT  – Hello, and happy earnings day to everyone! While Tesla missed the Street’s expectations, the stock has not shown its typical volatility at all. That being said, this earnings call is quite interesting due to the upcoming “Company Update.”     Tesla also reiterated its section about new vehicles that “remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025” in its Update Letter. What are these vehicles? Just variants of the Model 3 or Model Y? Was the Cybertruck LR RWD one of them already? Or are they actually new cars that we’ve just never seen before?     Either way, ten minutes and counting.   16:27 CT  – Now I’m just curious if the Company Update will be a video. The thumbnail Tesla is using on X and YouTube shows an “Audio Webcast Only” graphic though. Three minutes and counting.     16:28 CT  – And there’s the music. Wonder if it’s going to be on time.     16:34 CT  – Annd we’re now on the Elon time threshold. Tesla stock is actually up 4% in after-hours today. Pretty nutty considering that the Q1 earnings are a miss.     16:36 CT  – The earnings call is formally starting. Here we go.  Elon Musk takes the stage. “There’s never dull moment these days,” he said. He admits to the blowback from his work with DOGE. He also admitted that those against DOGE are bound to attack him and his companies, such as Tesla. Musk reiterates his belief that it’s important to fight waste and fraud. “I think it’s critical work,” Musk said.     16:40 CT  – Musk discusses the protests against Tesla. He alleges that the protests are not organic. “The actual reason for the protests is that those who are receiving the waste and fraud want to continue receiving the waste and fraud,” he said.   Musk notes that starting next month, in May, his time allocation for DOGE will drop significantly. He will continue to spend a day or two on government matters or as long as the U.S. President wishes him to. “Starting next month, I will be allocating more of my time with Tesla,” Musk stated.      16:43 CT  – Musk noted that Tesla is no stranger to challenges, but Tesla has been through the ringer several times in the past. “We’re not on the ragged edge of death….not even close,” he said.     He also highlighted that Tesla is on the cusp of autonomous cars and autonomous humanoid robots. Musk expects unexpected bumps this year, but he remains confident on the future of Tesla. The idea of Tesla potentially being the most valuable company in the world by far was reiterated. “Maybe as valuable than the next five companies combined,” he said.      “We expect to be selling fully autonomous rides in June in August,” Musk stated. He also stated that autonomy in cars will affect the bottom line by mid-2026.     16:47 CT  – Musk discusses Tesla’s supply chain, highlighting that Tesla is the least affected automaker by the Trump tariffs. That being said, Tesla has been working to localize its supply chains for years. He admitted that tariffs are tough on companies where the margins are so low. Musk also clarified that he continues to advocate for lower tariffs, but that’s all he can do. Trump has the decision.   “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in on the decision, but its primarily up to the President. I continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,” Musk said.     16:50 CT  – Musk noted that he would now explain why he is very excited for Tesla’s future. He noted that Tesla is laser-focused on bringing autonomy in June in Austin, Texas. He highlights Tesla’s general approach to autonomy.      “We have a general solution (to autonomy) rather than a specific solution,” Musk said.     He also noted that Tesla expects to use thousands of Optimus robots in its factories this year. He expects Optimus’ ramp would be one of the fastest. By 2030, or 2029, a million Optimus per year is plausible.     16:52 CT  – Musk highlighted that the Tesla Energy unit is doing very well. “We expect the stationary energy storage to scale to terawatts per year,” he said.   16:54 CT  – Musk stated that Tesla chose to update the Model Y in Q1 because the first quarter tends to be the weakest. People do not usually buy a lot of cars in winter, after all. He highlighted that the Model Y is the world’s best-selling cars.      “We picked Q1 to cut over to the production of the new Model Y…at the same time in factories across the world,” Musk stated, adding that, “In conclusion, while there are many headwinds, the future of Tesla is brighter than ever.”     He thanks the Tesla team and stated that he is looking forward to leading the team.      16:56 CT  – Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja takes the stage. He explained the company’s reduced vehicle deliveries, which were caused by the changeover to the new Model Y across its factories. He also noted that the negative effects of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards Tesla and its staff affected sales in some areas.     The CFO noted that even with these challenges, Tesla was able to sell out legacy Model Y in Q1. “We have an extremely competitive vehicle lineup and after that we have FSD,” he said.   17:03 CT  – Taneja noted that the Powerwall 3 has been received well by customers and Tesla is currently supply constrained.      He also discusses the effects of tariffs, though he highlighted that Tesla is a very American automaker. Tesla is not immune to the tariffs, but the company could navigate the challenging landscape better than other automakers. That said, Tesla’s US lineup complies with USMCA by 85%. The company is working on non-China battery suppliers as well.     17:06 CT  – Say Questions begin. First up is a question about the highest risk items on the critical path to robotaxi launch and scaling. Elon stated that robotaxis in June in Austin will be comprised of a Model Y fleet.      “Teslas that will be fully autonomous in Austin will be Model Ys,” Musk said, adding that Tesla’s paid autonomous rides will be coming to other cities later this year. “I predict there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year [in the US].”     Musk did state that there will be some localized parameters for Tesla’s paid autonomous rides in different regions, like snowy areas. A good driver in California won’t be as good in the middle of a blizzard in winter, after all.   17:09 CT  – Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot/AI Software at Tesla, noted that localized parameters still follow Tesla’s general approach to autonomous cars. He also highlighted that validation is still critical for robotaxi operations. In Tesla’s factories today alone, there could be many days without interventions, making it hard to figure out if FSD Unsupervised is working as intended.     Musk and Taneja joked that Tesla customers in China are really pushing FSD to its limits. People in China “putting [FSD] to the real test,” Musk stated.      Cybercab is also in sample validation now, and it’s still scheduled for production next year.     17:12 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about when FSD Unsupervised will be released. “Before the end of this year” in the United States, Musk stated, adding that FSD Unsupervised must be meaningfully safer than human drivers before it is released.     17:15 CT  – A question about Tesla’s new cheaper models is asked, and if the company is focused on simplified versions to enhance affordability, similar to the RWD Cybertruck.    Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy noted that these cheaper vehicles are still on track. The ramp is slower than we hoped but nothing is blocking the company from initial production.     17:21 CT  – Another question is asked, this time about how FSD Unsupervised will compete against Waymo’s offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing and regulatory flexibility.     “The issue with Waymo’s cars is that it cost waayy more money,” Musk joked. He also stated that Teslas cost a quarter or 20% what a Waymo cost, and the company’s vehicles are made in large volume.     Musk predicts 99% market share for robotaxi unless other companies can deploy the same amount of vehicles on the roads as Tesla. “I don’t see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present,” he stated.     By the end of the year Musk is confident that the Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer autonomously from the factory.   17:25 CT  – A question about the unboxed method and how that is progressing was also asked. Tesla notes that the company’s unboxed process is progressing. “You’ll see it on tests and roads in the coming months.” Tesla is also focused on improving the method, like marrying sub-assembly areas together. “This is a revolutionary production system,” Musk noted.      When describing the Cybercab line, Musk stated that “it will ultimately achieve a cycle time of 5 seconds or less.” So far, Tesla is fastest at 33 seconds in Giga Shanghai.     17:29 CT  – A question about tariffs and political biases was asked. The executives noted that Tesla is very localized already. Localization for Tesla is 85% in North America and 95% in China. “We’re ridiculously vertically integrated,” Musk stated.     Tesla makes lithium, cathode and cells. Only thing left is the anode. Musk also stated that Tesla’s in-house cells are the most competitive.     17:34 CT  – A question was asked if Tesla has "
Elon Musk's Tesla got a crucial loan from this federal clean energy finance program: Now he may DOGE it - Trellis Group,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOTFhjTGgxSE5mMHQtRWFTZEVKUFFoN25FVEpJdk95amQtRGtiRGFZcjMxV25tMDJEbGl4WmczVWlkNDExY05MX0p5WGk0cW5JNXZGem9DdlZZRUR2QWVWWXFrVkE3TnJqZlZ0aUFMbm1zcnJQMXE0akVQU19BX0lYU2RCWnFWVFE3LWJzV0V2RWV2ejhFWGtsX1VOLXA3X2FmZFpWdy03U1VpU0tlNWtwLVBtRGplNFI1R2tSQ1hpMnlNWjQ?oc=5,"Mon, 09 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Program Office (LPO) that has financed a historic $44 billion in clean energy projects finds itself facing uncertain times. Department officials last week hosted the second annual Deploy24 conference, where they joined executives from the renewable energy technology sector came together to discuss the future of the clean energy industry.   The Department of Energy proudly says LPO’s  $43.9 billion portfolio  “has supported job creation and is preventing harmful CO 2  pollution while enhancing American competitiveness in the global economy.” Most notable, perhaps given Elon Musk’s zealous cost-cutting role in the new administration,  is LPO’s bailout of Tesla in 2010 with a $465 million loan.   The timing of the conference — just a little over a month before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, a well-known critic of climate change and clean energy initiatives — dampened the hopeful spirit of the gathering. And that was never clearer than during a private media roundtable held with Jigar Shah, director of the DOE’s Loan Program Office, and the executives of four clean tech companies to recently close on funds from LPO.     What you need to know about LPO   LPO will keep working until the inauguration   When asked whether LPO will be able to close any more deals before the Trump administration is officially back in power, Shah said that most depended upon the applicant. Noting that the fastest LPO has closed a loan is 40 days (at the time of the roundtable, there were 46 days until the inauguration Jan. 20), Shah said that if the applicants are willing to move faster on their end, he doesn’t see why more funds can’t close before Jan. 20. Shah described current applicants as “sufficiently motivated to move forward,” at faster pace.   LPO’s fate during Trump 2.0 is still unclear   No one knows how Trump and Musk’s  DOGE  will reduce federal programming or clean energy tax credits, including Shah. But that uncertainty didn’t diminish his perspective on the future.   He said that current and prospective borrowers “expect LPO to continue function after the inauguration,” adding that the LPO needs to continue to function during the new administration to ensure the loans, paid for by the American taxpayer, are fully repaid to the federal government.

Tesla’s Sub-$30K Model Q And 2025 Product Plans: Key Insights From The Deutsche Bank Report - Carscoops,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNR0VMcF9yQUZldkcxWnFKcVBYYXNGLWR5bU42eFdBWW1hLXpJazlmbndVUGNERU5yNHBqcWxfTHF0cTBGUWZyaU1Ob2tmWVBEdVhZWGJuWE1PejJQbGRGR2x1MWQwOW9QeUlQbERnTllIV1pveU5FMWQyeGItV2JldlFwSjVYVFdJWXZhZ0RTb0ZaMjBqWkN4bWROVXZnYmozcXJCOVNhSHFTOWZXa3BVa3hqMmtVQQ?oc=5,"Tue, 10 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Tesla’s Head of Investor Relations, Travis Axelrod, attended Deutsche Bank’s Autonomous Driving Day in New York.   The bank’s report highlighted the launch of a new affordable EV for early 2025, tentatively named “Model Q.”   A stretched, three-row Model Y variant targeting the Chinese market was also mentioned in the report.         The EV world lit up with speculation  yesterday after reports emerged from China stating that Tesla , and specifically its Head of Investor Relations, Travis Axelrod, had confirmed plans for a new lower-cost EV set to debut next year during a Deutsche Bank meeting in NYC on Monday.    Predictably, the rumor mill began grinding away. To separate fact from fiction, we obtained a copy of Deutsche Bank’s report summarizing the meeting. While the report offers some clarity on Tesla’s ambitions, it stops short of providing concrete details, leaving plenty of room for speculation about what’s to come.   Future Cars:  Everything We Know About The 2026 Tesla Model Y ‘Juniper’   According to the Deutsche Bank report, Axelrod participated in the bank’s Autonomous Driving Day in New York, where discussions centered around Tesla’s  Full Self-Driving  (FSD) technology, robotaxi development, and the Optimus humanoid robot. Somewhere in this high-tech mix, Tesla’s product plans for 2025 emerged, though the details were far from comprehensive.        Product Roadmap   The Deutsche Bank report offers a broad overview of the meeting, albeit without attributing direct quotes to Axelrod. However, the context strongly suggests that the new lower-cost model was a key topic of discussion. If true, this marks a significant shift in Tesla’s product strategy for the coming years.   The report outlines Tesla’s strategy to unveil several new vehicles in 2025:    New models and 2025 volume growth     A new, entry-level EV referred to as “Model Q” is set to launch in the first half of 2025. It will reportedly be priced under $30K with subsidies (or $37,499 without).   In the second half of 2025, Tesla is expected to release additional models aimed at expanding its total addressable market (TAM). One of these is believed to be a 3-row, longer-wheelbase Model Y variant, likely exclusive to China.   Tesla plans to build all new models on existing production lines, emphasizing efficient use of capacity to achieve its targeted 20–30% volume growth in 2025.   While management remains confident in scaling up the China supply chain, the high end of Tesla’s volume target will require flawless execution, particularly in North America.   The company’s plans for its Mexico plant remain dependent on geopolitical developments and tariff policies under the new Trump administration.     A Budget (Driveable) Tesla           Illustrations Jean Francois Hubert/SB-Medien for Carscoops                     Now, let’s dissect the key points regarding the model presentations. Arguably, the most noteworthy aspect here is the introduction of a more affordable model, tentatively named “Model Q” by Deutsche Bank rather than Axelrod himself. Notably, the report made no mention of specifications or the rumored “Redwood” codename circulating online.   Elon Musk  has been skeptical of low-cost models in the past, not out of dislike, but because of the significant challenges in achieving profitability, maintaining quality, and overcoming high development and production costs.    Back in October, during an investor call, he stated, “ Having a regular (aka driveable) $25K model is pointless. It’d be silly .” That said, the projected $30K price point for the Model Q doesn’t contradict Musk’s remarks. If anything, it suggests Tesla is threading the needle by offering a lower price point without completely compromising its profitability.   Future Cars:  What Could A Tesla Model 2 Look Like?   Currently, Tesla’s least expensive vehicle in North America is the RWD, single-motor Model 3, priced at $34,990 with the $7,500 federal tax credit (or $42,490 without). This makes the introduction of a sub-$30K Tesla a significant move – assuming it’s more than just a smaller, stripped-down version of  the Model 3 .   What Form Could The Model Q Take?                 If the Model Q materializes, it begs the question: will it be an entirely new, compact offering or a derivative of existing models like the Model 3 or Y? Perhaps it could take shape as a smaller hatchback with crossover-like proportions, as shown in our rendering. A more far-fetched, albeit intriguing, possibility might involve a driveable version of the Cybercab. But I digress. It’s anyone’s guess at this point, but the report points to a reveal in the first half of 2025, meaning we won’t have to wait long for answers.   Stretched Model Y For China           Our speculative render of the 2026 Tesla Model Y ‘Juniper’ (Thanos Pappas for Carscoops)       The Deutsche Bank report also confirms recent rumors from China about a stretched, three-row version of the  Model Y . This longer-wheelbase variant is designed specifically for Chinese buyers and is expected to build upon the refreshed Model Y, codenamed “Juniper,” which is set to debut next year. The addition is logical in a market where larger/longer family vehicles are highly appealing, enabling Tesla to better compete with local rivals.   What Else Is Coming?   As for the “other new models” mentioned in the report, details remain vague. However, Tesla’s focus on expanding its Total Addressable Market (TAM) indicates the company is aiming to capture new customer segments – whether through pricing strategies, diverse body styles, or regional exclusivity.   More:  Musk Predicts Tesla’s 2025 Sales Will Surge 30%, Gives A Nice Boost To Share Prices   Additional points in the report highlight Tesla’s confidence in scaling its supply chain, particularly in China, while also emphasizing the challenge of flawless execution in North America. Regarding Tesla’s much-discussed  Mexico  plant, its future hinges on geopolitical factors and tariff policies under the new Trump administration, which is an unpredictable variable, to say the least.   A Critical Year Ahead   While the Deutsche Bank document offers an intriguing glimpse into Tesla’s roadmap, it stops short of providing concrete details. What we do know is that 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the EV maker, with affordability and versatility taking center stage.   Looming over all of this, however, is the potential for a seismic shift in America’s EV policy. If the upcoming Trump administration scraps the $7,500 federal tax credit – arguably the key driver of EV sales – Tesla and the broader industry could face serious headwinds. Germany serves as a cautionary tale; after subsidies were cut in December 2023,  Tesla’s sales there plummeted by over 43% this year .   Obviously, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Yet, as always with  Tesla , the answers remain as unpredictable as the company itself.   Puts and takes for 2025 margins     Tesla explained that 2025 will be a year of product launches, and whenever that happens, there will be disruption to profitability as it will be in the early days of building a product and have more inefficient fixed cost absorption.   But this could be offset by a lower cost of goods sold from the more affordable products.   2025 margins will also hinge upon where ASP (Average Selling Prices) lands based on the demand curve.   The main goal is to focus on growing volume and garnering incremental gross profit (as opposed to targeting a certain gross margin %), delivering at least overall FCF (Free Cash Flow) breakeven. The auto business is basically funding more ambitious future projects."

Why are there no Tesla dealerships in Alabama? - AL.com,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOMTZyRHZsMTJBWVljVzVqZ1Z6VTh0Wjg0dWJHOEhoRGVhX0d6Q2RIQ2FZa09ONnBXeVN4a0pUV24wbW9DdEM1cG1PS0RISUFpekxFYXEtV29vMks0b2hzUjNzaXI4QThyTkwzS3ZBNFhiMUxsUmhUMHh1Q0l2dHpCRm9LOXZHeHJ1LU9VdkRNeHFTSUZ0QXFrRNIBrAFBVV95cUxPRDliTmNidnRsTkVFM2FGUW1RR0VIVTJ5eUdSNEhWckZOcXlhUXNrNHFNRzBjU0NCaVFlVUxrYkVOWkdTWHRzdWdVLW5odXZRT3dURnNWLUNSS2hBZXU1ZGVJdnRHbkdzbWFXelB0OWl5WUx4cDlweGdlUDU0YVZyaVFrZDVjUG13aWhtbG0wWklUUlVxbXJUODRCZVlMcEMtZTFwcFVjQ1B0ZzNO?oc=5,"Fri, 27 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT","Electric vehicle sales are growing around the world, and EV maker Tesla is the most valuable automobile company in the world. So why can’t you buy a Tesla in Alabama? Japan: Nissan, Honda abandon merger talks over ownership disputes First, a few numbers.  According to the U.S. Department of Energy,  there are little more than 13,000 electric vehicles registered in the state of Alabama. That’s far behind California, which leads the nation with 1.2 million registered EVs. In the U.S., Tesla has the largest market share of EV sales, dominating with 49%,  according to the Associated Press,  though other automakers are making inroads. Globally, Tesla commands 17% of market share. The company is worth a staggering $1.4 trillion. Tesla also accounts for the two top selling electric vehicles in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y SUV and the Tesla Model 3, according to Rho Motion. The Model Y SUV retails for nearly $45,000, while the Model 3’s least expensive version sells for around $42,000. According to Tesla,  there are currently 16 Tesla supercharger stations in Alabama. There are also 39 cities with electric charging stations throughout the state. But if you want to buy a Tesla,  you’ll have to drive a little while to look over the models in a showroom. There are four dealership galleries in Tennessee, six in Georgia, 24 in Florida and even one in Mississippi. There are stores in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Tesla relies on company-owned dealerships and online sales, rather than franchise dealership sales like other automakers. This strategy allows Tesla to control each aspect of the product, from assembly to sales. The automaker also relies on word of mouth instead of large scale marketing. However, Alabama is one of several states where the law prohibits automakers selling vehicles factory direct to consumers. This has been a norm historically since the beginning of the auto industry. Alabama state law prohibits them in a passage dealing with “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” According to the  National Automobile Dealers Association , the dealership model allows automobile makers to focus on vehicle production, leaving dealerships the job of sales and maintenance. In theory, the system is also supposed to help consumers by keeping prices low due to competition between dealers. Consumer advocates argue auto sales should be as easy as buying other items online - allowing the buyer to customize their order and click. In 2016, former State Sen. Tom Whatley, R-Auburn,  proposed Senate Bill 22  to “allow a manufacturer of alternative fuel vehicles to sell and lease its vehicles directly to the public.” That would have applied to Tesla and other manufacturers of cars fueled by electricity, natural gas or propane. The bill died in committee."

There's also the fact that this incident took place in the rain, and Elon Musk famously refuses to use anything but cameras for its self-driving tech. As we all know, water on camera lenses inhibits their effectiveness.         Related     Autopilot suspected as the culprit in 10 deaths since 2016.

On top of all that, back here in the US, a judge recently found ""reasonable evidence"" that  Tesla CEO Elon Musk knew about the defects of its Full Self-Driving software  (FSD), yet he allowed the system to continue operating. That is part of a case in Florida where a  Tesla Model 3  owner was killed when their car drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler truck in 2019.

The feature is supposed to allow Tesla owners to summon their vehicle to them in a parking lot, or send the car off to park itself in a remote location. However, predictably, results have been variable. It appears Tesla is still  happy to use its customers as beta testers  in the real world while selling its systems as being complete, or just wholesale  mislabeling the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system .   It's going to be a fascinating year as government agencies are  looking very closely at Tesla  and its automated systems, and the catalog of public mishaps and deaths is now long and in the public consciousness. Yet, Musk is set to head a new Department Of Government Efficiency that the incoming US president says will, “provide advice and guidance from outside of Government,” and “dismantle Government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies.”         Related     Tesla Full Self-Driving now includes a Hurry mode that aims to slice through traffic and get you there quicker.           Musk has already publicly gone after individuals in government, including the Department of Energy’s chief climate officer in its  l oan programs office, the same office that awarded $465 million to Tesla Motors in 2010 and set the company up to become the market leader in all-electric vehicles. Previously he attacked Missy Cummings on social media when she became a senior advisor at the NHTSA. He was angry because Cummings' research and public comments criticized Tesla’s self-driving programs and called for regulating the systems. What the future holds for these semi-autonomous vehicles is unclear, but more crashes seem likely as Tesla works to ""solve autonomy.""         Source:  The Guardian (Australia)"

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and Clark County Fire Department officials told a news conference that a person died inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck and they were working to get the body out. Seven people nearby had minor injuries and several were taken to a hospital.   The fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m., a county spokeswoman said in a statement.   According to a law enforcement official, the truck was rented via the Turo app and appeared to have a load of fireworks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Photo by Ronda Churchill/REUTERS   READ MORE:  A fireworks explosion in the Honolulu area has killed 3 people and injured at least 20   Law enforcement officials have not ruled out terrorism as a possible motive, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.   “I know you have a lot of questions,” Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge for the FBI’s Las Vegas office, told reporters. “We don’t have a lot of answers.”   President Joe Biden was briefed on the explosion. The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police.   “The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a statement on X, adding: “We’ve never seen anything like this.”   In Las Vegas, witness Ana Bruce, visiting from Brazil, said she heard three explosions.   “The first one where we saw the fire, the second one, I guess, was the battery or something like that, and the third was the big one that smoked the entire area and was the moment when everyone was told to evacuate and stay away,” Bruce said.   Her travel companion, Alcides Antunes, showed video he took of flames lapping the sides of the silver-colored vehicle.   The 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall.   Eric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media platform X. He praised the fire department and local law enforcement “for their swift response and professionalism.”   Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Zach Miller in Washington contributed to this report.

The problem could cause users to unknowingly drive on low-pressure tires.   ""The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) warning light may not remain illuminated between drive cycles, failing to warn the driver of low tire pressure,"" wrote the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in a  statement .  The recall affects certain 2024 Cybertrucks, 2017-2025 Model 3s, and 2020-2025 Model Ys. In good news for Tesla owners, the company said it released a free over-the-air software update that would remedy the problem. Letters notifying affected owners are scheduled to be mailed on Feb. 15.    A Reuters  report,  citing recall management firm BizzyCar, stated that Tesla accounted for 21 percent of all U.S. recalls in the first three quarters of 2024, though most issues were resolved with software updates.    The Cybertruck, especially,  has been the subject  of several high-profile recalls throughout the year."
