It was just the right combination of size (always liked smaller cars), performance and usefulness (I can't afford 2 cars).

And I totally get that I may be disappointed with the M3P, but I'm also sensitive to monthly payments, wanting to buy a new house in the not-too-distant future, so there's the MUCH lower monthly payment swap. 

As well as the other things you mentioned - less maintenance, cost, etc,,,,,, I confess, I'm also in a little ""cut back"" mode even though I can afford the current payments.

Add to that, until I get my new place, I'll have to use Superchargers, so that'll be a pita but,,,,,,

Ford and GM have programs that will install a level 2 charger for you. You really only need to run a dryer outlet. 

Now that Ford and GM have access to most of the Supercharger network, getting a Tesla doesn't make as much sense since they have so many quality issues

The Equinox or Blazer EV are fantastic products. They also have heat pumps so they're great for the winter. 

The Mustang Mach E is, in my opinion (and why I bought one) the best non Tesla EV. They're getting a heat pump starting in February. Ford is great because they loop most charging networks through their phone app so you don't have to download 18 apps. They also have plug and charge on EA, Shell and the Supercharger network which makes charging really easy (you can also do autocharge on EVGo but have to sign up through the EVGo app). 

Most non Tesla EVs will get the next generation plug and charge in 2025 so the issues with charging networks will be resolved pretty quickly 


Hybrids make the most sense if you don't have home charging"

If I were someone with one of those cars, I'd be doing recordings of the issue and trying to get attention on it.

That said, the HW3 retrofit on a 2.5 car is only $1,000.  I'd be looking into it if I knew it got me better performance.

For what it's worth, I have an MCU2 car that I retrofit to HW3, and an MCU3 car that also has HW3

I try to keep the hardware in my cars updated as retrofits become against *because* it is known that Tesla slows down development on cars with older hardware.

The MCU1 folks, for example, get like one or two big updates a year.  MCU2 folks aren't that far behind that kind of cadence.

But, again, first time I'm hearing of these kinds of bugs on HW2.5, but also, the upgrade to HW3 isn't that much either."

If they’re not working they don’t really need/have use for the charitable deduction of the present value of remainder interest either. 

I’d start really focusing on strategic conversions. 

Do they have a taxable account? You could look at selling Tesla in the IRA and identifying tax lots in the taxable account from other holdings that net out to zero realized gain, and sell those, then buy Tesla. Kids would get step up in basis, and if needed, spouse could sell with a higher basis (though not stepped up). Essentially moving Tesla from one pocket to the other, plus Tesla is a tax efficient asset so prob better to move it to a taxable account.

It’s anyone’s guess when Juniper will come out and whether the tax credit will be around then.  You just have to make the best decision with the information you have today as to whether to buy now or wait. 

There’s a lot of demand for Juniper. Tesla is not going to offer any discounts or incentives. You will pay MSRP as will everyone else until initial demand is met. Then once that happens you will see the same discounts we’ve seen over the years.  Personally I’m only a buyer when nobody else wants to buy and Tesla is throwing out crazy incentives.  That’s why I chose to buy a 2024 Model Y.  I have no problem upgrading to Juniper down the road but I’m not going to pay MSRP and get one of the early production models.

IT APPEARS you're in such denial that, like a juvenile, you make a baseless insult then hide from a response by blocking my account. 

Does that really make you feel like you know what you're talking about?

This is a serious question.  

I've often wondered if people like you are cognizant of your own BS and hollow, unsubstantiated dismissal of reason, generally for the unquestionable reason that your are great or above it all.

Maybe you are aware that your actions prove nothing to yourself or your interlocutor but somehow feel your puerile behavior convinces others of your greatness and/or baseless claims.

Based on your username, I imagine that you consider yourself some sort of genius residing above a world of useful idiots. 

Do you think useful idiots would have read your comment, without me being able to respond, and somehow say ""Well, this stosif guy didn't really say anything, but man is he right.""

People don't generally read this far. So, what the hell was the point in blocking me after calling me stupid and beneath you. 

Was it really just an ego thing?


Final questions, if your answers to the second question is an affirmative; are you aware of the fact that this would likely make you a narcissist? Do you see the arrested development resulting from this condition?

Any plans to try and fix this? Maybe you could practice self-criticism as a start. 

Insulting then hiding by blocking an account only feed the condition and perpetuates arrogance, which, ironically to those like this, makes you less knowledgable and less wise. 

Have you considered this?

Seriously, I am curious. Most narcs seem proud of being narcs, which also seems irrational. 

So, please, explain your thought process here?"

 It makes it much more difficult to compare when the other channels - Dirty Tesla, Chuck Cook, AIDRIVR - all specifically take their vehicles into denser stress-test environments.

The Trump administration (or any administration) can make specific rules/carve outs that specifically benefit one company, (I.e special federal tax benefits for Texas based EV car companies, converting the federal car fleet to EVs with the contract going to Tesla, all federal offices converting to solar with Tesla winning the contract, etc.) 

I think that’s the play here. A very wealthy and powerful businessman is tied at the hip to the incoming administration who is known to be especially kind to those close to him personally…. It would make sense to bet Tesla is going to get increase business. And honestly, I’m thinking there might be a point when conservatives start buying Teslas just bc they associate Musk with Trump (sort of like the My Pillow Guy, All my Trump supporting relatives own a My Pillow)."

My fiancee then asked her “what if we did get a Tesla?” At that point I tuned her out, because I knew she would react the way she did. She went on a triad about “Elon musk this, Elon musk that”, “Elon Musk is the devil”.

Stau in Bucuresti, fara charger acasa. Absolut nicio problema, incarc la 6~10 zile(o tin intre 20-80%), fie la Supercharger, fie la slow AC cand ajung in mall-uri, Kaufland, Lidl, etc, masina se incarca cata vreme fac cumparaturile. In primavara  am fost cu masina asta in trip prin EU cu familia pana in Luxembourg, experienta extraordinara, de la iesirea din Ro, am incarcat numai la Superchargere, nu a fost nevoie de altceva. Deasemenea, in vacanta tot cu ea in Grecia (btw Bulgarii stau super bine la chargere) dar la destinatie am avut slow charger. Masina e spatioasa, confortabila, performanta, nicio problema pana acum cu ea. 
Cateva aspecte importante: pt drumuri lungi iti face masina planificarea pt opriri; daca esti genul care vrea sa conduca 8h plus fara oprire, nu iti lua electrica; daca esti genul care sta cu “ochii pe baterie” tot timpul si nu esti dispus sa te relaxezi si sa schimbi mindsetul (masina electrica se incarca in timp ce tu faci alta treaba, nu te duci la pompa pt asta) nu iti lua electrica. Daca vrei sa platesti foarte putin pe “combustibil”, fara charger acasa nu se poate la o electrica; este clar mai ieftin decat combustibilul necesar pt o masina cu combustie interna cu performante similare, dar nu te vei imbogati din asta.
Daca esti pasionat de tehnologie, te vei bucura foarte repede de o Tesla si fiecare drum va fi o experienta placuta."

Various anti-spam measures have been created in the meantime to combat this (e.g. SPF & DMARC) - which Tesla use, but it's on the recipient's email provider to enforce them. If your ISP isn't making the right checks then spoof emails will be allowed through.

If your email client allows you to see the full source of the email then the raw headers will allow you to determine whether or not the actual message came from Tesla. You'll need to compare the IP address in the first ""Received"" header to the list of IP addresses in Tesla's SPF record (which is big!). You can also look for the ""Authentication-Results"" header and see whether it states spf=pass and dkim=pass.

Elon’s losing users by droves from his now failing twitter. A poor investment.

He treats his employees like shit and I bet they quit when they line up a better job. Like, he wanted them to live at work and now work for free‽ A company can’t run without employees.

Trump will dump him within 6 months because he doesn’t like anyone else taking any of the spotlight. Like Cohen, Mr Pillow, and Guillani, Elon’s investment of a shit ton of money will prove pointless.

As the CT sales drop, he will stop producing new parts for it; within a year I bet it will be hard to get them. After he milks the idiot buyers for all those expensive add ones. It’s not like anyone else can/will have, or make stuff like the giant wiper blade, top window, or those panels that are coming unglued.

Of course lidars and radars ""can't predict the future and intentions of other road users"". That is the job of the ""planner"" sub-system in the autonomous driving software stack, which is something that all autonomous systems, camera-only or those with camera+lidar+radar, etc, have.

What lidars and radars (part of the ""perception"" sub-system, along with camera, microphones, inertia sensor, etc) can detect is that, in this case, for the last x-milliseconds, there is a freaking HUGE SOLID OBJECT ahead, and tell the ""planner"" about it, which would then either activate the brakes or steering to avoid the obstacle. If the camera can't identify it, no problem, the system can log it and used it to retrain the image recognition system later. All that is needed at the moment to avoid a crash it to know that there is a big thing ahead that must be avoided. A camera only, in poor visibility conditions (or when there are flashing lights in emergency vehicles) still gets confused, in spite of the great progress in computer vision in the last few years."
1,2024-12-09,u/Salategnohc16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h9krb0/shorting_tesla/m175tib/,">In Norway where EV's are on the rise and make up 90%+ of sales, Tesla has been selling less cars.

And this is obvious and another stupid argument that I see even ""ANAList"" take.

If the pie get ( much) bigger, the slices will get smaller in% terms, but still bigger in raw numbers. Ultimately, Tesla will be at best 15% of the auto market.

Tesla was 80% of the ev car market in the US in 2020, but the EV car market was 2% of the total US car market, now they are 5% of the Us EV market, but the Us EV market is 11% of the total, so they are selling 3 times more than they did in 2020, same in the rest of the world.

>Q3 was 7% up and the best quarter of 2024, Q1 was down 2%. The years before growth has been 70%, 51% and 18%. Growth is really decreasing and profits are going down -45% Q1, -55% Q2, +18% Q3. So Q4 needs to be very good to beat 2023 (Where Q4 was very strong and will look most likely see a decline again).

I also like it because it goes into a low-power state when the car’s off so it doesn’t drain the 12V battery. One of its quirks is that if you unplug it and reconnect it, it forgets everything it’s paired with (presumably for security) and you’ll need to repair it. If you keep it plugged in then it’ll stay paired.

It may be worthwhile to calibrate ABRP by driving a bit with ABRP open and connected to the dongle so it can measure how efficiently your car drives at low, medium, and high speeds. It’ll do this automatically when ever it’s open and connected. ABRP is really good, but gets even better with good specific-to-you calibration."

They think that the batteries are worse for the planet than all of the gasoline a car would use(like they think gas doesn't have to be refined and then transported).

They assume anything electric is from CHINA! Especially anything solar or wind related they go on rants about how thats not green because they use precious metals to make them.

I was told that it would take 3 days to drive across Texas in an electric vehicle because you can only charge very slowly at your hotel. I explained Level 3 charging, but by the next day the conversation was on cars again I heard them restate that it would take 3 days to drive across Texas they heard - despite the fact I'd explained fast charging to them.

For now, rubes think it's an ""investment"", that all of Leon's amazing tech will pan out to make Tesla one of the most important companies on the planet. To be fair to them, there was once a lot of hype around the man, and many of his ideas seemed plausible if A. you weren't a physicist or engineer, and B. you didn't pay close attention to the details. So I suppose this once was an understandable -- if always naive and misguided -- position.

The problem is, as they say, ""you can't get there from here"". There is no conceivable, much less remotely plausible, path to Tesla ever justifying its market cap. ""Autonomous"" cabs with remote human operators? Sorry, Waymo is a decade ahead of them (for better or worse). Electric semis? Sorry, Volvo (a serious company which does real engineering) is at least half a decade ahead. Humanoid robots? Total joke! And even if they weren't Boston Dynamics is 2-3 decades ahead of Tesla. EVs? Sorry, China is already winning. Their charging tech is a winner, but with no way to capitalize on it aside from their dwindling EV market share, they felt compelled to open source it. So no way to reap royalties even as it becomes the US standard. Solar tech? On par with the mainstream coming out of China. 

Am I missing anything significant?

Every single area where Elon has convinced the rubes that Tesla will be a leader and game-changer, they have already fallen behind, failing to deliver product while their competitors are already established and building markets -- markets which Tesla has no part in. Eventually, these chickens will come home to roost. Wall Street may not be engineers, but they are by and large also not rubes. Eventually, they will be tired of backing a stock which has no return beyond the flimsy pyramid scheme, and when that happens the house of cards will begin to collapse."

What happened to the shareholders is the value of their stock rose a lot. That’s not the same as being beaten.

Because it’s not clear how exactly the shareholders were harmed here, it gave Elon political cover to move Tesla to Texas. Cover he didn’t have after, say, the Twitter purchase ruling, because in that case the business community said “sure, dude needs to follow his contracts, makes sense.” They were less on board with this ruling.

And it’s not like a specific prescribed rule was broken where the answer is cut-and-dry; this is about the application of principles & common law to a set of facts. By delivering an unintuitive result, shareholders left Delaware entirely. Maybe Texas will turn out to have better protections but I have my doubts."

Asteroids impacting earth at higher relative velocity are bad. But if one hits earth and there's a massive tsunami, nobody is going to be calling out fossil-fuel climate change for that, it's obviously the impact. 


But for gravitational effects on sea level of it passes by earth (or is captured into its orbit)? I mean... Technically, if you include relativistic effects, then you could talk about  some small ""extra gravity"" from fast objects. But even at earth's orbital speed around the sun, you are only at 0.01% of the speed of light and such relativistic effects are basically negligible, except for precision timing (like in GPS satellites). So, practically speaking, no, the speed doesn't matter for an asteroid passing by the earth. 


So to be clear: an asteroid **hitting** the earth could cause extreme transient sea level effects (tsunami etc.). Any forseeable asteroid **passing by** earth absolutely will not cause significant sea level impacts. The sea level impacts we are expected to see over the next 50-100 years are not caused by gravity from asteroids, but by warming caused primarily by greenhouse gases emitted by human activities and associated feedback effects. "

There was a TSB out to replace interior cameras for certain models. I was one of the ones affected. Whenever they cut over to the vision based monitoring for FSD opposed to the steering wheel input, apparently some cameras didn’t have a IR sensor. I only found this out when i was using my FSD trial late at night and I would constantly get this error messages saying that my camera was blocked and FSD would disengage. Turns out when I checked my interior camera, it was pitch black in there. I submitted a ticket asking about it and they just had me come in and they replaced my camera. Now when i test out the interior camera when it’s pitch black out, it can display the interior with IR and FSD works fine late at night."

See some that say it’s amazing and others will be like ‘whoa look at what it just did?’ I had a few rentals with the FSD activated before FSD13 came out. It was 98% ok. I had to intervene once but that was about it. Otherwise it did what it was supposed to. Keep in mind there’s a reason why it’s called FSD supervised. It’s not supposed to be completely autonomous. Now on the other hand randomly pulling into oncoming traffic is definitely something that needs to be fixed. 

Also the other day I saw a model S try to use ASS to bring the car to them since it was raining. Only problem is that parking lot was packed with people and cars. To the people that use ASS if the parking lot is that full please refrain from using it. The model s got to the intersection in the parking lot and basically just stopped right in the middle. Too many people walking around the car and with cars on every side trying to go around the model S definitely confused the ASS a lot. So it just stopped in the middle of the turn as it was trying to either wait for traffic to clear or it was thinking. Eventually I think ASS kicked off and the driver had to go and run to the car in the middle of the intersection."

It isn’t there yet, and I honestly am not smart enough to know if it ever will be. But just because it isn’t perfect doesn’t mean that it isn’t useful. Cruise control and TACC are not perfect systems and still require the driver to be attentive, but they still are desired features because they make driving easier and reduce energy requirements and stress while driving.  Autopilot and now FSD are just better versions of TACC and cruise control with more capability, so driving is even less stressful and easier. If you treat it as a redundant system - ie it can cover for you if/when you get distracted (an inevitability when you’re a human being) and you cover for it by staying attentive and ready to take over - i think you’re safer using it than not. After I got my Gen 2 Volt with TACC I said I’d never buy another car without it, I feel similarly about AP and now FSD for my 3 now, which is why I stuck with another 3 this year instead of moving on to another electric car."

The lack of information from Tesla about this function has caused the community to do a lot of guesswork or extrapolation of information from random tweets. The community seems to be divided in two camps:

 - Bug reports aren't used for anything unless you go to the Service Center with a problem and they pull the bug reports from the car
 - Bug reports are automatically forwarded to Tesla and processed by them

Some Tesla employees have claimed that the information from the bug reports stays in the car unless someone actively pulls it. Nobody outside Tesla knows if it is true. Or if it was true then, but not now.

I have received these instructions from Tesla on reporting map errors:  

 - Make a bug report in the car
 - Write an email where I include my vehicle VIN and the date and time of the bug report

I guess this lands somewhere between the two camps. It tells me that Tesla is at least able to pull the bug reports remotely. But it also tells me that they do not trust the bug report to reach the people who need it unless I point them to it."

Hi OP. Thanks for this request. WATCH OUT FOR  people that pm you directly. If they offer to do your request for money then they are probably scammers or at least breaking the rules of this sub. Do not fall for it.   Unless you have specified that this is a ""Request a PRO"" request, if anybody PMs you offering to do the job for compensation please REPORT THEM TO THE ADMINS HERE: https://www.reddit.com/report. The admins have asked us to tell our users to report all PMs asking for money as harrassment. Include link to pm. We want to stop these idiots. Thanks! Doesn't mean you can't tip. Just means they can't ask you to. 
  
**To COMMENTERS:**  
Hello users. We want to keep this place free from people asking for money. If OP is not offering a reward for this request, please do not ask for one.  Tip jars etc are not allowed except in ""Request a PRO"" requests, messaging OP saying you will do it for compensation is not allowed either. That's scamming.  Also IBB.CO LINKS ARE REMOVED BY REDDIT and we cannot do anything about it. Do not use ibb.co. Go for imgur.com, it works.

It's 3-4 stops for 650 miles.  For your range I suspect the estimate of 10 is accurate.  You can charge longer to make it fewer stops but you'll spend more time charging overall.  95 in particular has an absurd number of superchargers so I would suggest just driving as the car recommends and charge extra if you feel like taking a bit longer at a particular stop.  It will adjust stops automatically.

The reality is that you are drawing that line on how far to look back into human history!

But that aside - let me propose a truly modern take on what being a local is - one who has integrated well into society, shares many or most of the cultural traits with the existing population, AND has contributed to the nation over a long period of time, for multiple generations. It is the taxes, labour and charity of multiple generations of Singaporeans that has made Singapore what it is. Not Malays alone, not random new citizens - it is a mix of people who has for many generations chosen and contributed to Singapore as their home.

Why is it superior to actually incentivise your own citizens from not going extinct - oh I don't know - social stability, continuing to have a population which is loyal and focused on contributing to building the nation for the long term and not just on exploiting whatever the host nation has to leapfrog to a better place for themselves? Or maybe - just maybe - it is to ensure that our education system and career processes are well maintained and built out, so that we can PRODUCE the world's best talents, rather than relying on importing the folks who couldn't get a good shake in their own country. It's called national security, but perhaps it isn't that important these days, we rather pursue economic good for a select few.

>Virtually all of modern Japanese culture is different from ""traditional"" Japanese culture and had been""hosing down"" post WW2.

Nice that you have practically no understanding of pre and post modern Japanese history. The majority of Japanese culture stems from 2 main points in history - post-Sengoku's Edo period (which is where a lot of implicit and explicit cultural rules and norms that are a huge part of Japanese culture stem from) and Meiji restoration (suits, firearms, trains (wow!)). Food and technology (clocks, cannons, matchlocks, etc.) from Nanban trade yes, but culturally it took far longer to integrate and ""Japanify"" Dutch food (castella, tempura, etc.) - similarly with military technology. Took the Boshin war 2-3 centuries later to truly solidify the use of firearms as a staple material in Japanese militaries. 

The majority of ""modern"" Japanese culture is not from ""post WW2"". It's funny how you can talk about meiji restoration while also claiming that modern Japanese culture is mainly american / european because of WW2.

While I would love to rant on about when, where and how cultural shifts emerged from Japan, this doesn't add much to the conversation. Japan is kind of a horrific example on your part - like many homogeneous nations, they slowly ingest foreign cultural inputs and make it their own over time. Even for suits. I can assure you most Europeans do not wear stiff black suits all year round for their work. This is more of a uniquely (toxic) Japanese thing to be forced to do (yes forced). Similarly with KFC for Christmas... who tf does that but them??? Or Christmas being more of a holiday for couples than family, or the wide variety of everything that is uniquely Japanese even if it was adopted a long time ago.

A better example of more rapid cultural integration and syncretism would probably stem more from antiquity, by comparing Greek and Roman polytheistic pagaism or civilizations. Another smaller scale example to look at would also be with Successor Kingdoms across much of asia minor, persia, egypt, etc. (essentially modern day middle east) and how Greco polytheistic pagaism, culture was consumed and integrated with local ""eastern"" cultures of Egyptian polytheistic pagaism, Zoroastrianism, etc.. Aside from integrated eastern / greco politics, culture and society, successor kingdom combined arms tactics with use of traditionally eastern military material and tactics with greco ones - this would be the most ""rapid"" source of cross-cultural integration (\~few decades to few centuries) that actually formed something new and unique as a result.

>You cannot stop the internet from influencing kids. You cannot stop the rise of Hollywood and Bollywood in Singapore. You cannot stop people from eating mala and learning French instead of Chinese as a second language.

You'd notice this is vastly different from the examples given above - if I'd give an example from antiquity, this would be closer to importing and enjoying say Egyptian wheat into Rome. Or Persian perfumes into Athens. Enjoying stuff made in other countries from other cultures is not equivalent to integrating that culture into a core part of your state / community / etc.'s identity.

I'm no more Japanese than some random Singaporean chicken rice uncle even though I know and enjoy Japanese history more than most normal Japanese people. I can assure you that while the weeaboos across Singapore would love to be more Japanese, they are staunchly Singaporean culturally. They will not (and good chance that they will never be) seen as even a tiny bit Japanese. No amount of new sake businesses, ""Japanese"" food stalls will change this. Singapore is staunchly NOT Japanese despite the logic you used."

Once you reach the limits of vision and the solution is understood you can add more sensors to it. 

The question is which. Personally I think infrared is much more interesting than lidar. It lets you see in the dark and gives you super human capabilities in terms of seeing living things like humans and (warm-blooded) animals. 

This video is interesting in part because of its timing. Tesla has been showing that perseverance seems to be paying off. 

Have they been willing to break a few eggs to make their omelett? Most definitely, and it’s a shame that it has cost lives, but all the examples in the video were several years old and the discussion is about how autopilot was working at the time. 

I’m not saying autopilot/FSD is getting anywhere near perfect, and the current state might be more dangerous than how it was in 2021 as people will start trusting it more when it does less mistakes. 

Partial automation is well understood in aviation and it’s generally considered that a system that cuts in if the human messes up is better than that the human must intervene when the computer does. 

Unfortunately such an approach would put generalized self-driving much further away than Tesla’s."

I’ve driven that route many many times and I can objectively say the trip planner has gotten much better but you have to be a bit more cognizant. In the past it would say go up to 83% and arrive at 20% and I’d have to drop down to nearly 70mph to make it. Now it tells me charge up to 93% and I arrive at 17% on the dot.

This means that in a single phase market, type 2 cars AC charge speed is effectively capped at 7kW.

Hence the reason cars in single phase markets used J1772 (type 1), instead of type 2. J1772 can support up to 80A (19.2kW at 240v).

  
I live in a type 2 market Majority of current EV's support 11kW charging (either 7.2kW by drawing 32A from a single phase feed, or 11kW by drawing 16A from a three phase feed). Some support single phase charging only (i.e. kona series II, which supports 7.2kW), and some such as the Lyric support 22kW (32A at three phase).

For the US market, given there are vehicles like the Hummer EV with a 205kWh battery pack, 7.2kW is just a bit slow, so the standard type 2 plug is no good.

  
It's really a pity that the industry didn't come up with a global connecter that could handle all of the below:

* \~80A single phase AC charging
* \~32A three phase AC charging
* \~500A / 1000V DC charging."

Tesla got great results with cylindrical cells and perhaps had advantages of being to quickly unload the cells by varying where the tabs were for cathode/anode. In their history, Tesla has migrated to larrger and larger cells (now larger than D sized batteries. What is NOT in question anymore is whether it was a good idea. In China, Tesla has become INCREASINGLY dependent on both CATL and BYD batteries. They are lower in cost, faster to charge, thermally more stable, less prone to fire and, especially with LFP chemistry much longer life. There is truly NOTHING better about the cylindrical legacy design EXCEPT its ability to discharge quickly for 0-60 and 0-100 runs.

But the credit card you used to make your $250 deposit might already be the default payment option in your account. Look to see what your payment information is, as you'll need it entered before supercharging will work. Test at a local supercharger first, before you go on your trip, don't want to find out it's not working when you're miles away from home and can't get back with the remaining charge."

The spec includes the use of Bluetooth, nfc, and ultra wideband to authenticate with the car based on what’s available in the car. This is what the digital car keys found in Apple wallet and google wallet implement. The key shows up in your phone wallet and gives you some functions like lock/unlock. You are also able to share the key via text or email and even restrict some features before sharing the key. No need for an app, the key itself lives digitally in you phone wallet. 

While the Tesla app works ok as a digital key, it seems odd to not embrace this standard. With the implementation of uwb in app for the highland model and this Apple Watch app they seem to be doubling down on their own implementation. 

Following the spec would allow the digital key to already work on iPhones, Apple Watches, androids and android wear instead of requiring additional dev work. The watch would also, out of the box, implement uwb interactions with the car allowing for more accurate unlocking/locking the car when approaching/leaving. 

Rivian recently implemented this and it’s a very nice feature to have. Tesla’s implementation of the digital key via app was nice years ago but now that there is a set standard that Apple Samsung and Google are all backing it’s frustrating for Tesla to not embrace this cross platform operability. With the aliro digital key standard coming out next year, a home key version based on the digital car key standard, this appears to be the future of keys in general and I’m hopeful Tesla eventually adopts it."

But it had side effects, first fascist nationalist dictator known to mankind spawned afterwards, aka Napoleon and the royalty had a comeback.

Do you have any of the following:
Garrage at home for charging
University charging 
Cheap public charging nearby

Second question:
Are you into road trips? Then see if you have a good super charger network 

One thing for Performance is that, it just doesn't end at higher one time cost. It comes with additional costs:
1) Higher insurance. This is important since you are 18, so you premium might be higher to begin with 
2) Performance models are slightly less efficient (10-15%) than long range models. If you have free changing order very cheap charging then it doesn't matter. Also, another thing to consider is whether you have range anxiety?

Apart from that, I have M3P and I love it.

How nice the vehicle was would justify any extra price, although I'll say in the US the Tesla price was lower than any of my local dealers. Like I don't think a regular used dealer would have put $1500 worth of brand new tires on and replaced the scuffed wheels.

It does change the narrative then thou, we are not talking about ""you buy a 35k tesla, and it will earn you 50k a year with ride sharing cause FSD"". It changes the entire conversation then, the economics of robo taxis depends on how much cheaper it is to a, well...., real taxi.

It sill might be profitable for running, actually working, robo taxis in select cities, but that is a far cry from ""you don't need your own car, you can call up a robo tesla anytime you want a car"".

Range will change slightly on each drive - it is dependent upon things like weather, wind, and speed. Like for instance, if you drove from 100% charge to “Empty” going 40 mph the whole time, and then again going 70 mph the whole time, the first, slower drive will give you better range. And if you live in a very cold/very hot climate, your internal cabin temps will also eat away slightly at your range. It’s not a crazy amount, but enough to maybe cause a 30-mile difference each time. 

This is true of ICE cars too, just not as noticeable because the “tank” is usually much bigger to begin with. 

I drove from Orlando to Atlanta and back recently, a drive that I had done many times before in my Honda. I only stopped 2 more times than I would have anyway for bathroom/gas breaks, and they were very quick 10 minute charges. And I am a high AC consumer, had passengers, and a trunk full of baggage slowing me down (both physical and emotional, but emotional won’t have a mileage impact 😉) 

I know range anxiety is real when you first buy an EV, but trust me, unless you make coast-to-coast drives regularly, you will be okay!"

You’re not wrong, I’ve suffered depression and anxiety since I was very young and that used to be a deterrent to having a family because I didn’t think I’d be capable or functional enough to take care of anyone, not even myself. But as I get older and have the latitude to make it happen, I’ve made my life better and my roadblocks manageable, I realize I can do it, I’m gonna make it. Esp since I basically grew up alone with no family but my mom, it dawns on me how scary that kind of aloneness really is and how important for me to cultivate a healthy, stable life for my future family and be someone reliable and dependable and loving. Not because of validation but because of love, a bigger meaning than just my little self

Later I got a message from Octopus app saying “unable to charge” because the car had hit 80% again, but the schedule is still there.

5,2024-12-21,u/llamacohort,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1hiebna/tesla_has_highest_fatal_accident_rate_of_all_auto/m36ziot/,">This isn't always true. I drive a 2-liter turbo that has peak torque at 1500 RPM that continues to redline. I'm basically in my peak torque (300 ft-lbs) at all times unless I'm idling.

This is incorrect. Turbo vehicles are not always making boost. If they weren't, the fuel milage would be terrible. 

Lets look at an example, the new BMW 3 series has the same engine and performance as the 2019 Car and Driver tested. The 0-60 is 5.2 seconds. With rollout, it's 5.5. The 5-60 is 6.4 seconds. So it has a lag in performance of 0.9 seconds and whatever the 0-5mph is. If you assume it got to 5mph in the rollout, that would be 1.2 seconds of building boost and dropping a gear. 

In contrast, the Model Y performance has a 3.6 second 0-60 and 0.3 rollout, so 3.9 seconds total. The 5-60 is 3.7 seconds. That is 0.2 seconds to get to 5mph and absolutely zero lag. 

That is why people started caring about 5-60 times. The wider the gap between the 0-60 and 5-60, the most laggy the vehicle is in real world acceleration. The launch control numbers and full boost engine specs are not representative of actually driving the vehicle.

>Again, I want to know what the scenario is where instant torque would cause deaths. Do you think that people are accidentally jamming the throttle down at a red light with a pedestrian crossing in front and mowing people down? I don't get it, and no one's even tried to explain that for reasons I won't speculate on.

It's probably more complex than ""instant torque"", but somewhat related. Tesla making a lot of heavy and fast cars mean that people doing similarly stupid things could have worse outcomes. They are just building more energy than most other vehicles and especially when considering the price. 

Another contributing factor is likely that until just recently, if you wanted a long range tesla, you had to get a vehicle with 425 hp. The RWD used to be only a low range model. So people who see the car as an appliance and upgraded from 15 year old Honda Fit were driving vehicles with far more power than they have ever driven before."

You have to see where it'll actually fail, not where the driver/supervisor becomes uncomfortable."

Autopilot feature is totally different than Supervised FSD. I use Autopilot all the time as it is intended, on freeways and highways. It basically keeps the car in the lane, it’s a good adaptive cruise control plus keep in current lane system. It’s not meant for city streets. In every car when using Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) the driver usually must pay attention. Only a few claim driver attention isn’t required but they work within such small areas and under strict conditions that drivers end up having to pay attention. 

I also have had the supervised FSD for the last 6 months as a subscription which expired 3 weeks ago. Yes, it makes mistakes but they were all easy the correct & nothing crazy such as rapid acceleration or slamming on brakes or driving on wrong side of road. I used FSD to drive me all up and down California, stopping to see various sites & visit friends. The self parking is fantastic."

If you've done your DD and are willing to ride it out for the long term (I don't do options or margin) then decide what % of your portfolio to put into XYZ stock and don't sell unless the thesis has changed. 

I've owned, trimmed and bought $TSLA for over 6 years now. The last few years have provided many opportunities to buy and sell, depending on my 25-30% band allocation. I remember buying one dip at $109, then even earlier this year I believe in the low $140s. I've also trimmed along the way, including a bit around $350.

Does the Supercharger cable reach all EVs?

Most Supercharger cables at NACS Supercharger sites should be able to reach your EV charge port, however, in some cases you might have to park over the line in order to charge comfortably. Avoid parking diagonally to reach the cable and try to obstruct as few charge posts as possible. Charge port locations vary by EV model, which requires cable sharing between adjacent stalls at many sites. Tesla is rapidly deploying our latest V4 Supercharger post which reaches all EVs in the same Supercharger stall. Additionally, we encourage all vehicle manufacturers to standardize charge port locations to the rear driver side or front passenger side."

This is the 2nd end of year in a row of massive discounts and incentives, in the face of very slow growth. Those model Y's were piling up this fall, as were model 3's last year. Is this healthy or sustainable? Remains to be seen. Early this year the markets, reacting only to sales figures, pushed down tesla stock prices-the run up right now is completely Donald driven and a bubble thats gonna hurt when it bursts.

Then you held yourself up as a new buyer so evidence of new customer growth.  I guess then that I'm equally right because I got my second Tesla 4 weeks ago  ;-)

Now, ""Elon is toxic"" is a broad assumption (but a correct one). It's been widely reported, that the majority of Tesla owners hold social-political views that are the polar opposite of DOGE boy.

Canada's entire economy is smaller than the economy of California. How do you expect startup numbers here to match the states?

I acknowledge that Canada does not push for innovation, but it will take far more than deregulation.

Since you didn't respond to this, I'll ask again. How many Sharks have been sold so far? None. It took them a month to get 4,000 pre-orders. The Shark is not a comparable truck to US trucks. It is a midsized truck. That is tiny and weak compared to US trucks. Seriously, have you never seen a US truck before?"

A Tesla is the unequivocal champion of rideshare vehicles, and I can confidently say this after three years, two Teslas, and 125,000 miles of driving. My first Tesla, unfortunately, was wrecked by a hit-and-run driver, but I didn’t hesitate to replace it. The one I drive now is a Model Y Performance, and it does 0-60 in just 3.5 seconds—wickedly fast for any vehicle, let alone one used for rideshare. Tesla remains the leader in self-driving and navigation technology and builds some of the safest cars in the world. Every model, even the slower ones, offers incredible performance. Plus, the driving experience and performance characteristics are competitive with any other vehicle in their class.

Charging costs are another major advantage. In my area, I pay around 10.5 cents per kilowatt hour for home charging and 41-42 cents at Superchargers. Compare that to gas prices at $3.10 or more, and you're saving 60% or better in most cases. To put it into perspective, for every $1,000 I would have spent on gas, I save more than $600 by using electricity instead. With a 75-kilowatt battery, those savings add up fast. My first Tesla didn’t even have a wall connector at home since I live half a mile from a Supercharger. On long trips, the car handles all the charging logistics—directing you to the nearest Supercharger, estimating costs, wait times, and even how long you’ll need to charge before continuing your trip. It’s incredibly convenient, and for rideshare work, it makes charging downtime manageable.

Operating costs are impressively low. Tires are the biggest expense, costing $1,000 to $2,000 for a set, depending on the model. Add in electricity and tire costs, and I spend about $0.08 per mile on my Model Y Performance in southeastern Pennsylvania, compared to $0.17-$0.25 per mile for most gas vehicles. Maintenance is minimal—there’s no oil, transmission, or exhaust system to worry about. Sure, suspension components like tie rods or control arms may wear over time, but that’s true for any car. Beyond that, the only expenses I’ve had are windshield washer fluid and car washing supplies. I avoid automated car washes with brushes, so I invested in pressure washing equipment for my driveway.

There are some drawbacks. Tesla’s customer support can be frustrating if you have a problem, as they rely heavily on text messaging and automated responses. Resolving issues can feel impersonal and slow, which is something to consider. However, in three years, I haven’t had major problems that weren’t resolved under warranty.

What truly sets a Tesla apart for rideshare is the rider experience. No less than 30-50% of my passengers have never been in a Tesla before, and many are excited just to get in. The smooth, quiet ride and thrilling acceleration make a strong impression. I’ve lost count of how many rides this year alone have been filled with laughter as we accelerate away from a stoplight. Riders feel safe and comfortable, and that excitement often leads to better tips and ratings.

That said, the car can only do so much. The quality of the driver makes up 85% of the rideshare experience. If you’re awkward, unengaging, or unprofessional, it doesn’t matter what you’re driving—the passenger will pick up on that. If you can match the quality of service a Tesla provides with your own professionalism and delivery, you’ll stand out as one of the best drivers out there.

In summary, the car is wickedly fast, the technology is top-tier, and the overall experience is unmatched in the rideshare space. While there are a few drawbacks like customer support and the cost of tires, they pale in comparison to the benefits. A Tesla is an investment, but one that pays off quickly for rideshare. If you’re on the fence, I’d say go for it...but if you've the mind for it, think about starting your own business. Uber is bleeding us dry, and the efficiency of a Tesla is onw of the only things that makes it feasible right now."

New vehicles are expensive and time consuming to develop.  Tesla is a relatively new player in the Auto sector so releasing a bunch of new models of all different shapes and sizes would be less profitable without more scale than the current business model.  Based on the last few earnings reports, new vehicles including more affordable models are coming in the first half of 2025 so it's very likely these have been in development for years.  The company needs to balance the market and its own financial heath when making a roadmap for product launches that may not align with your ideal vision.

**""FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif., Oct. 5, 2023** – Hyundai Motor North America today announced that it is adopting North American Charging Standard (NACS) ports for its electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States and Canada. In the United States, all-new or refreshed Hyundai EVs will come exclusively with a NACS port, beginning in Q4 2024. Canada will follow in the first half of 2025. Hyundai EVs with NACS ports will gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This will double the size of the DC fast charging network available to Hyundai EV customers.""

I always objectively cite my sources...lol 

It would be ridiculous for Hyundai to not have the same charging standard for North America. There's lots of people who cross the border on a regular basis. Also, the Tesla infrastructure is a lot better in some parts of Canada then the CCS. As an example; the city I live in only has one level 3 CCS charger, and we have a combined population of 30,000 people. But, there's 6 Tesla superchargers. If you're driving across Canada, and you get to my city and need a level 3 charger and the one charger in town has an ICE vehicle parked in it (happens all the time!) you're SOL. Yet, the Tesla chargers are located at shopping mall parking lot with ample parking, and there's 6 of them."

Overall, the body panels seem within spec, I felt the same way about mine. Don't worry, they're easy to adjust, I did mine myself after watching YouTube. No big deal.

I am though concerned for you about the glass... and the bumper cover being obviously damaged. 

That type of bumper cover damage is pretty evident that the car was not handled well during shipping... Doesn't mean that there's any problems just that it was handled roughly by the shipping partners. Mine was literally crashed by a shipping partner unloading it from a train, whole passenger side front fender had to be replaced prior to delivery... They weren't even going to disclose it but I had already confirmed my delivery date and they had to postpone to get a new fender shipped. They don't have to disclose damage under a certain percentage of the vehicle's total value. So the only reason they did is because I asked why they delete it and I was speaking with the operations manager at like 10:15 at night and was supposed to pick my vehicle up at 7:00 a.m. and they didn't have a solution... At least they were honest I guess!

I'm going to echo what everyone else here is saying. I had issues with my car, they were bad enough that I was not willing to drive it off the lot without knowing how it would be handled. As soon as I accepted delivery of the vehicle I was able to create a service appointment in the app to address all of my post delivery concerns. It is extremely important that you get every single thing that you want fixed, photographed and in this service request within 48 hours and 100 mi after accepting delivery. If it is not within that mileage and time frame they will not do anything about it. 

You pretty much take a picture of the concern, type a sentence about what you're concerned about and then move on to the next item. All of your concerns will be compiled into a service request which is then by the Tesla Service advisor and then either approved, or denied based on policy and procedure and/or if it's applicable and actually something they can fix reasonably. 

TL;DR: Typical new Tesla delivery; doesn't look that bad! Congrats! After you accept delivery, you MUST create a service request and in that service request photograph and make written notice of every single thing you want fixed. You can do with within 48 hours and 100 miles after taking delivery. Do not wait 49 hours. Do not wait 101 mi. Do it now. Tesla will review your requests and the photographed findings and approve or decline fixing them based on standards."

1,2024-12-18,u/Artiem_Heg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaUK/comments/1hf0j3q/stealth_grey_vs_ultra_red/m2niu7c/,"In the 4+ years of being a Tesla owner, I have never had any major mechanical or technical issues. Yes, there have been a few minor glitches/issues here and there, but I would say far less than some of the brand new ICE vehicles my friends and neighbours have had.

The Tesla support team can, at times, be a bit slow to respond, probably due to the massive inflow of new owners over the last few years in comparison to the service team size. No different to any other successful growth company. Personally, I have always found the Tesla team to be helpful, and on occasion, they have gone the extra mile to provide a better than expected service.

I think the main issue is that, as with most things in life, people only post or advertise the bad experiences opposed to the good ones. So, the online forums, etc, are a wash with people complaining and stating the problems they have had. I would hazard a guess that this pales into insignificance compared to the succes stories that people do not post.

In regard to maintenance, there is very little routine maintenance required, tyres and windscreen wipers/washer fluid being the only real main ones. There is no oil change, timing belt, and mechanical parts that need regular checking or routine maintenance. Even the brakes on Teslas don't need as much attention as most can drive with only using the accelerator pedal and regen braking for the majority of the time. So, in comparison to an ICE vehicle where the brakes are used every trip to slow down and stop, electric cars with regen need fewer brake pad/disc replacements (unless you drive like a rally driver 😄).

In my opinion, the only benefit of an ICE over EV is the refuelling time and range, but once you get into a routine of charging and know where chargers are etc this benefit is lost against all the downsides of an ICE.

I hope this helps and puts your mind at ease. If you decide to get your Tesla, I am sure you will love it and be back on here pitting others' minds at rest🤙"

So with #1 - a) station owner ensures those with larger share of wallet can spend more vs. chuck on a truck who buys 2 packs and they profit $0.25 for both, b) helps profit tow companies who could easily be on hand during the holidays, and c) discourage the behavior.

1. Tesla attempts to get full autonomous driving going on HW3 with version 13.x

2. If they fail, expect HW5

3. If they succeed, they try to get a downsized model running on HW3

4. If they fail with THAT, they will probably have to offer free hardware upgrades for people who bought FSD before some date.

  
None of these steps are going to be fast.  And you're not going to get an answer on hardware upgrades until Tesla feels like they are out of options.

It's possible we'll get the occasional downsized model but it takes resources and they probably see it as slowing down the overall process so don't expect too much."

During the summer I'd drive about 10-15% per day and get back ~25% charging every day. Now I'm spending about 20% a day and getting back less than 15%. Only solace is that if previous years are anything to go by we don't have too many truly cold days let alone weeks.

 I remember looking at an ioniq years ago but deciding against it because of winter range, opted for tesla thinking with the long range and the heat pump I'd be okay but I'm finding it hard to recommend an Ev in this kind of winter unless you have L2 charging.

And Mercedes, every drive feels like you get into cozy living room and you can choose if you want to just chill while you arrive, or if you want to feel the road and enjoy the drive. Cost to repair is constant, but it is easy, every year you pour some 750eur for oil change and on the same time repairguy does additional things and car doesn't unexpectedly erode all around.

It has changed lanes back and forth before getting to an exit it never had a problem with before, missed exits it didn’t ever miss before, and tried to go through a stoplight that had lost power without stopping first when the car in front started going.

It seems like it may be more sensitive to irregularities in the map data than previous v12 builds.

Overall, I would say my interventions have increased on a preventing illegal moves basis and my interventions to prevent missing an exit or turn or something have also increased.

I think they need to do a lot of work on their maps, and they really need to test for and find a way to suppress the spontaneous misbehavior.

It also still has the annoying behavior where it will try to go around a line of cars waiting for traffic ahead of them to start moving, which would result in failure to merge, and it having to reroute.

It also still doesn’t understand bus lanes are not for driving in.

While I feel relatively confident FSD is about as likely as a person or even less likely to cause a crash resulting in injury to the occupants or others outside the vehicle, it really is not ready to be unsupervised as it continues to violate traffic laws and not navigate well."

I am NOT a fan of the company's policies, procedures, or CEO. I will say, I have had great joy and luck out of my 2019 Model 3 Performance. It's been the best car I've ever owned. I haven't had as good luck with the 2015 Model S I owned, or the '14 Model S I currently own. Both S's have required a few repairs here and there (naturally, as they're older), but they can be more expensive than your normal ICE vehicle. I'm a DIY guy, so I tend to repair my own vehicles, but Teslas do sometimes require software style repair work, which I am not able to do. If you get a good Model Y, you could be repair, and essentially maintenance free for years. BUT, if you get bad Model Y, it could require costly repairs. And we just don't know which one this model Y will be. So I would say err on the side of caution."

If the edge cases are things like heavy rain (where the natural response is to slow down) to night driving where someone's tail lights are out I don't find a compelling use for any technology.  What I find is people focusing on what are traditionally bad situtions for sighted drivers as well.  LiDAR might help in those situations, but you couldn't change the default driving posture that should be in place which is conservative.

It seems kind of obvious the point of the cameras over lidar is because as long as human drivers are on the road, focusing on driving a human driver couldn't pull off themselves is perhaps dangerous by itself.  You don't necessarily want faster than average driving and quick correction in an environment where the other sighted drivers can't anticipate/respond to it.  It creates a new problem."

where I don’t like M3 is hard cornering, breaking in  a turn and wet performance…but I attribute all that 100% to the stock tires on M3…skinny max mileage EV tires versus versus my Audis Michelin Pilot Sport All Seasons & Pilot Alpin rotation

(This leads to users accepting more bugs, since they can be fixed later).

This leads to issues in user experience for the early adopters of said vehicle and possible risks in the completeness of the features within the car.

Also, for the traditional car manufacturers the SW support after facelift version of the model (with likely HW updates), becomes obsolete in many cases. (Which again makes the OTA an issue, if the bugs are still there).

So again, in my opinion, it's a two-edged sword depending on where you look at it."

When you know, you know - I knew. He didn’t. It still breaks my heart. I can’t even believe I’m writing about this on the internet after pouring out to my friends, my family, seeing my therapist again 

There is a pain of moving forward that is kind of beautiful in a melancholy way. When it’s over, really over, when it sinks in, when it no longer nauseates me or makes me cry or causes sleepless nights, it’s just a logical fact. Art comes out of this point — but at what cost?

This massive personal cost is part of what I’m writing my erotic stories trilogy about. It will be published next year by an independent press. 50 pages to go, the rest of the year what little is left will be devoted to this project. I have no tears left to cry.

If your FSD subscription has lapsed, then it doesn't really matter since you can't use it.

Oh man. 

I used to complain about the auto brights in my -22 model 3. But then Tesla enabled matrix lights in the EU in early 2024 for every model 3 that has them installed. Luckily my model 3 had them installed from factory, as not every car at that time period did.

The improvement was massive. I can just keep my lights on auto now and the matrix lights work fantastically dimming as the car spots oncoming traffic or traffic in front of me.

Random glare from traffic signs also no longer fully takes out the high beams thanks to matrix functionality.

Plus watching the matrix lights function in the pitch black night is really fun.

Just wait until they get enabled in the US and you will only have wipers to complain about!"

Just like if they made it a 50k ICE nobody would buy it because they could buy the 50k full sized f150 ICE for the same price and would feel that's a much better value.

Tessie seems to do a better job at figuring out how much power was actually used.. in the last 7 days (I didn't have Tessie for a few days at first) it reports 67.52kWh added to the battery, with a total of 122.49kWh used. For the last 7 days, the smart plug reports 122.09kWh - so pretty darn close.

I suspect that the Tesla app is only accounting for energy that ends up in the battery, and not energy used to warm the battery/etc. It's been pretty cold a few of these days, so 15A charging hasn't been efficient at all."

So ein paar Monate vor dem krassen Tesla Hype hatte ich ein Bestandsfahrzeug bestellt weil ich damals bei einer Probefahrt verdammt begeistert war.

Dann kam es zu einem Doppelverkauf, und ich blieb ohne Geld und ohne Auto stehen. Zumindest 12 Wochen lang, da dann mein Anwalt das Geld eingeklagt hat. Es war ein riesiges Chaos mit dieser Firma zu kommunizieren.

Heute bin ich so froh, dass ich dieses Auto niemals bekommen habe… seine Ketamin Sucht macht ihn langsam aber sicher kaputt, aber auch die Tatsache, dass sein Sohn/ seine Tochter trans geworden ist… er hält es psychisch nicht aus, und seitdem dreht er halt komplett am Rad.

Mit den Aktien ist es halt immer so eine Sache… genauso wie mit Aktien der Rüstungsindustrie. Muss jeder selbst wissen, aber ich finde man sollte da niemanden verurteilen."

Even that being said Toyota couldn’t fix my HVAC control panel that would pop out on every bump due to parts availability as well. Any other car that meets the same needs for me as the Model 3 are at least $15k more expensive and I’m not able to spend that much more.

It is their bread and butter. They **cannot** risk fucking up an F150 launch of any kind. 

They understand the kinds of hard duty cycles demanded of their trucks and test for the 95th percentile, meaning only a small 5% of owners will be more abusive…and I’d bet they even test those 5% cases and do the math and say “Look-here’s the limit of what we’re willing to claim regarding our trucks.”

I’ve been a truck nerd for more than a decade, and have seen things you people wouldn’t believe. Camshaft phasers that fail prematurely. Towing wars for maximum ranges no owner is towing at or should tow at…with constant leapfrogging for little to no mechanical reasons for the increase in payload or tow capacity other than magic towing dust. Plastic oil pans that fail/leak early. I’ve seen a PowerStroke diesel install two engine inspection ports in a compacted graphite iron block-the piston beat the shit out of one side, and the rod beat the shit out the other-where the piston and rod went…only God knows. 

And still, after all that…I’d trust any Ford truck over anything Tesla has ever, is currently, or will ever build in terms of quality, reliability, and longevity.

Howdy Neighbor! This is some fine weather we are having today isn't it? The cool breeze combined with the warmth of the sun just makes me feel at peace in my old age. It's much better than yesterday and the day before. Those dangerously high wind warnings were sure spot on weren't they. It was so bad that my poor elderly wife nearly went into Anaphylactic shock a few times because of her severe allergy to most of the tree's and bush's she passes by during the 20 mile walk to and from work these past few days. She is one tough broad though let me tell you. She didn't complain one bit when she forgot her lunch yesterday and had to take an extra trip back to the farm to go grab it. Even with her severe scoliosis, nausea from the chemotherapy, late onset dementia/diabetes, and chronic pain from the knife wound she suffered in WW2 she still made it back to work with just enough time to finish her daily quota of hand embroidered blankets so she wouldn't be put on landscaping duty again. She did tell me that she had to duck and cover a few dozen times in those bushes because she thinks she is being shot at when she hears a car back fire or some fireworks due to her PTSD from the war. Well anyway, my lovely wife noticed that your gorgeous automobile has not moved from it's parking spot the past few days and we just wanted to see if you would like her to help you get it back home. She would be more that happy to walk over to your house to pick up the keys and then drive it back to the safety of your garage for you. There is absolutely no rush though so you just let us know if we can help. I will even have Dorothy bake you one of her famous rhubarb pies when she gets home from work around 2:00am. It might take a couple of days to finish the recipe due to the carpel tunnel in her hands but don't you worry, as soon as it's done I will make sure she walks it right on over to your house just as fast as those beautiful arthritis ridden legs of hers will get her there. My sweetheart Dorothy and I look forward to hearing back from you when you can find the time to write us back. No rush!

Sincerely,

Dorothy & Bob Higginbotham"

I can understand keeping him at this point in the hopes that he leverages his ties to the administration to benefit the company (albeit shareholders should also note his ties are a serious risk as, in the event of a trade war, Tesla could be targeted for their association with Trump similar to how the US Agriculture suffered (and was only partially and temporarily compensated by the government) both because of their strong support for Trump and the easy access to substitutes, both of which would hold true for Tesla, who used massively invested in China."

The pay package was overturned by the judge, who found the board wasn't independent and was looking out for Musk's needs, not the company's.  In other words, the board was full of puppets who approved a ridiculous pay package.  The other share holders sued, basically saying the board wasn't looking out for the interest of the shareholders, which it is legally required to do.  The judge agreed and overturned the pay package.

Just because you managed to convince people to vote for something doesn't override a judge's ruling.  You can't just throw up your hands, yell ""Democracy!"" and that suddenly changes the law.

Keep in mind, this was in Delaware, which is about as pro-business as you can get.  It's why so many companies are incorporated there.  Even in a massively pro-business state, the board was considered too compromised for their decision making to be trusted in regards to Musk's pay package."

Not because he didn't meet all conditions of the contract - he did - but because one person with nine shares brought a frivolous lawsuit to a sympathetic judge.

Would you like it if you worked for six years and met all your targets and some judge voided your salary because they thought it was too much?

The judge argued his package was too much which is ironic considering his compensation was linked to performance, his options are only worth a lot because he met, and exceeded, the requirement of the contract. It is exactly what shareholders wanted which is why they approved it -- twice!
