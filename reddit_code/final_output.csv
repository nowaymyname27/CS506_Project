>  Then, a ship comes in. A pirate ship.

> Aeltven is on path for Evalyn’s gold, a trove larger than any seen before, and it is guarded by a demon. Fighting his way onto Aeltven

Is ""Aeltven"" the name of the ship? At first I thought it was a person, so it got me confused. 

> Renniel needs the capital to transform himself into someone worth hiring

This is also confusing. At first I thought ""capital"" as ""capital city"", then as ""money"" but neither of them make sense - how does he need money to get a job? Does he go into training / school? Start a business? 

> Renniel learns to gamble, steals from high-ranking crewmembers, and takes deals that are too good to be true.

This runs in contradiction of what you established earlier: 

> no amount of begging or stealing can save him. 

How before stealing couldn't save him but now it does? 

> years on the street made Renniel quick and clever, and he has magic, besides. 

If he's so clever and magical, why was he dying and unable to save himself at paragraph 1? 

This feels very much repeating itself how Renniel is in constant danger but that makes the pitch monotonous. It feels like ""oh no, he's going to die, oh wait, he found a solution, oh no, the cure is worse than the illness, he's even in deeper trouble, he's going to die, oh wait..."" etc. 

I think you need to focus on the gist of the plot rather than on all the episodic adventures the unfortunate protagonist stumbles into. 

*Who is mc?* Renniel, who's poor and lonely but also clever and magical, somehow. 

*What does he want?* To belong and to also not be poor. 

*How will he achieve it?* Make friends among pirates and go on a heist to steal the biggest treasure evah! 

*What stands in his way?* Uhhh... a demon? I guess? 

*Why is Renniel THE guy to save his friends from the demon?* Idk. He has magic? 

*What tough choices does he face?* Not sure, either he wins and gets rich and saves his friends or he dies and the book ends... 

*What does he need to learn to outwit this demon?* No clue. 

Basically, what is the conflict, both external and internal about? External is about defeating a vague demon (we don't learn much about it), internal no idea. Is he tempted by the demon to betray his friends in exchange for the treasure? Or maybe the demon sows dissent amongst the crew and he needs to unite them? No idea! 

Also why is Renniel's magic mentioned as a throwaway line. One would think it would be an important trait he possesses to get himself out of trouble and achieve his goals. 

Anyway, less focus on the status quo + setup and more focus what is the main conflict and mc's role in it."

Had a great backup to help avoid exhaustion, plus a teenager who needed time on loan to be ready to replace him.

Two seasons after he signed that deal he wanted a new challenge anyway, and went to Barcelona for pretty much the same. Fine by me - the other striker was 90% as good as he was anyway, plus a now 19 yo who had just smashed the Eredivisie on loan.

*The disorder broke out the day after* [Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/alice-bebe-elsie-three-little-29783261)*, were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance class at the Hart Space on Hart Street, just a few minutes walk away from the subsequent mass violence. Spencer, of Lytham Road, in Southport, was twice struck in the face and head by flying debris after taunting officers before turning around and being hit for the third time in the crotch with a brick.*

*Spencer admitted violent disorder and also racially-abused a Polish patient at the Southport Hospital while awaiting treatment for his injuries. It was heard in Liverpool Crown Court today, December 23, how the painter-decorator was at the centre of the riots in the town on July 30.*

*Spencer was taken to hospital for treatment after police were called to his brother's home in Southport. He was put in a cubicle to sleep off his intoxication but racially abused a Polish-speaking patient and a hospital cleaner when he awoke, telling them: ""Get out of our country, you don’t belong here.""*

*More than 50 police officers were injured, with riot shields stolen and police vehicles looted and set ablaze. In interview, Spencer denied rioting and claimed he had been trying to stop others from attacking the police. But he later admitted his account was untrue, telling officers what he had done was ""naughty"". Spencer, who has 12 previous convictions for 22 offences, said he had drunk 10 pints and a litre of rum before marching to the mosque.*

*He told officers: ""I just apologise again. It's honestly not me, that. I honestly can’t apologise enough.""*

*Spencer, of Southport, who admitted violent disorder and racially-aggravated harassment, was supported in court by friends and family. The court heard that he was already subject to the terms of an 18-month community order after kicking a police officer while drunk in December 2023.*

*Spencer was jailed for two years and six months.*

So how do we know we aren't among them?  How do we know our faith is the saving faith that will endure and persevere through testing?  We don't... 

1 John 2:19 ""They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.""

Jesus also alluded to those who would not remain in him with these words....

John 15:6 ""If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.""

Our carnal side wants to believe we can be saved while still living in sin...we want to have our cake and eat it too.  It effects how we interpret scripture....it creates in us a bias that is powerful and seeks to justify the position that we can't overcome sin in this life....and yet we are also told that:

1 Corinthians 10:13 ""No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.""

For me the key is ""deliberate"" sin...versus accidental or unplanned sin.  If we look at it this way...all verses can be true...especially the verse in 1 John that many like to stand on in order to justify a life characterized by sin...but can John really mean that?

1 John 2:1 ""My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ""

When he also says this:

1 John 3:6 ""No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.""

1 John 2:3 "" We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.""

The way I put this together is to say that, if we are living lives of faith and love...being led by the Spirit and bearing the fruits of the spirit...that ""if"" we sin....we have an advocate.

There will be sin either way....but we must judge for ourselves, is our sin alongside a life devoted to God? Or is it a moment of weakness? It's it in response to something spontaneous? Do we immediately feel terrible and repent?  
  
Or is our sin planned and enjoyed? Do we fantasize about it? Do we commit stupid little sins just because we don't really care and feel like ""I'm forgiven no matter what""? Are we overcome by it?  
  
I recently had to repent of all of this....I got tired of sinning and living as if I had no faith.  The bottom line is that saving faith produces a saved life, according to scripture, that we can evaluate.  I evaluated mine and realized I was living as if I didn't believe God...as if I didn't believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior (not just Lord).

Here is a test...

Real faith lives like he is in the room with us... who does wrong if they really believe that? Would we sin if we could see him? Of course not... because then we would believe.... we need to act the same way... when we can't see him... to call it ""faith"".

We should work on strengthening your faith... with stronger faith comes stronger love... which gives us more power to resist...because we don't hurt those we love."

Fits with my opinion.

My opinion on the PP problem comes from this NSF thread.

https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=57266.100

A lengthy discussion of the issue. Two controversial opinions are expressed there. Some argue that the NASA PP office is not relevant for issuing launch licenses going to Mars for private missions.

Some argue, PP is part of US government obligations and as such applies to private missions as well as NASA missions. I am afraid, this is the position that might prevail. Which means no missions for SpaceX with Starship ever. 

A Trump administration may overrule that position, reinterpret the PP rules and allow SpaceX to fly. Launching a small fleet of Starships in 2026 would already carry a lot of microbes, they can't be sterilized. Launching crew in 2028/29 would finalize it. After that prohibiting landings at the same site can no longer be justified by a new administration."

But, the common wisdom is that you have to be careful drawing too many conclusions about what a person is like based on them being autistic, because ""if you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person."" (Which jives with my own experience of autistic friends/relatives being very different from each other.) I think the consensus nowadays is that it is a very broad spectrum with a lot of variance between individuals, and notable differences between its manifestations in men vs women. This kind of makes it hard to talk about the impact of autism on someone's worldview, yet I think when it comes to people with enormous influence like Musk, it's important to consider what aspects of their thinking and behavior could be impacted by autistic differences. 

Obviously, it's in the eye of the beholder whether and when and in which contexts such autistic differences might have negative or positive impacts, but from the perspective of healthy democracy, it's a form of government that seems to work best when driven by people with strong empathy and excellent perspective-taking ability. One common autistic difference is difficulty with perspective taking, and limited empathy. In the media portrayals of Musk that I've seen, he definitely seems impaired in those areas, whether because of neurological differences or because it's just part of his limitations as a human being."

It's true that there were some good technical innovation in the engines that allowed them to do what they did at the time, but the reason these games hit us so hard was the imagination and creativity that went into every aspect, from the story line all the way to the HUD.

Even if all they did was beef up Source 2 a bit, give it a new feel that suited the game, maybe integrate generative AI (or bake it off), add a bit of ray tracing for nice shiny scientific scenes etc, that would be fine.  Then it would come down to some dynamite storytelling and plot lines for a plausible closure to that fateful resonance cascade scenario...

What would be critical though would be what not to do!  Some things would be:

Avoiding the ""Doom Effect"".  They can't innovate so far or take it in a direction that it's not really HL anymore.  The first guy at Valve who says ""Let's lock Freeman in an arena with just a few rounds for each weapon and kill 20 enemies"" should be thrown in the tesla discharge room.  🤣  And:

Avoiding the ""Matrix Effect"".  The first Matrix movie hit hard because of the deep archetypes and philosophy involved.  By the time we hit the third though, it was sort of getting a bit crazy...  more action and less psych.  Perhaps inevitable...  I don't know.  Not even going to talk about the fourth.

HL1 did the questionably ethical mega corporation secret underground lab concept quite well, laying the seeds of government conspiracy.  Then for HL2, there was a pivot to a resistance concept and exposure of the Government's actions to their rotten core.  They did this really well.

So what can they pivot to for HL3 that can be innovative but tasteful, subtly get inside our heads, and wind up the plot with something more exciting than shooting electric gelballs at a bigger...  gelball?  🤣"

I still struggle to this day at 25 with finances, keeping a roof over our heads and food on the table. 
You were old enough to have sex, so now unfortunately you need to deal with the consequences and face this head on. You need to make a decision ASAP, whether that be telling your parents, having this baby, adoption, or going for an abortion.

I was always a grade ahead in math and bragged about it like the pretentious little shit I was, lol.

When I was dual-enrolling, and taking Chemistry I, I made a B on the first test, which was wild for me, the then-perpetual straight-A student. I thought I had put a lot of effort in. I did end up making an A in the class, but stuff just did not click in Chem I or II. I one time derailed an entire lecture period just asking questions about a single concept that I simply couldn't understand, to the point even my peers were stepping in to try to explain it. Maybe I could force myself to do a medical field, but it'd probably get ugly fast (I don't even want to imagine what Organic Chemistry would've been like!). It's one thing to be lost in a 3rd or 4th year class in your major (this has happened to me in math), but when you're struggling with the most basic ones... sometimes it's better to cut your losses and do something you're more suited for, lol.

Around that time I took Calc 1, and I was a huge teacher's pet. I was at the top of my class, always asking questions, tutoring my peers, always on top of the homework, everything made sense, and I worked at the stuff that didn't make sense until I could do it. I heard it would be hard going into it, so I went into it ready to give it my all, and it paid dividends. My professor (who has since passed :c ....) was amazing, and taught in a perfect manner for me and it was just a perfect fit. I realized it didn't make any sense to spend years busting my ass in Chemistry-based classes that I'd inevitably struggle with, when here's another perfectly good career option that I actually am good at, always was good at, and do enjoy (that said, I *would* really enjoy helping people, and sometimes regret not being in a more directly helpful role -- but there's also things like Biomedical Engineering, which might be more suitable if I wanted to go the medical route, rather than the straight up Chemistry-based majors. Let's just say, I have a permanent career identity crisis, lol, and the math BS isn't ""helping"" because I almost have *too* many doors open to me now... weird predicament, ik).

> I enjoy the process of solving math and physics problems while studying, but I feel like I don't truly love the world of math and physics.

In the US at least, most people with even an engineering BS wouldn't ""know"" the world of math well, because actual math (proofs) is hardly drilled home until Real Analysis, which most people have no need of taking. Just an fyi. It's hard to say you don't love something, when you don't really know it yet (and I am no expert either).

> As for other fields, I haven’t had much exposure to explore them in depth, so I don’t know how to determine whether I like them or not, nor can I assess the future prospects of these fields.

Unfortunately, university doesn't fully prepare you for adult life, and only prepares you a small percent actually. You need to do a lot of research like learning what different topics, concepts, life philosophies, fields of study, exist. University is a start to education, and getting a degree should NOT be the be all, end all of learning -- learning should be a lifelong endeavor. Learn math in-depth. Learn what different subfields of CS there are. Learn what niche jobs exist that might interest you. For example, one of the top-paying and very stable jobs for math people is an actuary, but most people don't even know what that is. There's so many more careers than the obvious stuff like firefighter, doctor, programmer. I've spent a lot of time over the years looking into different kinds of jobs, because there's just so many options out there and some are just objectively better than others in terms of stress, fulfillment, pay, benefits, etc."

A phoenix with its head pointed downwards or tail pointed downwards, or worst, completely upside down like a dead bird.... is a really, *really* bad omen. 

A bloodied phoenix is worst than that. Like if you drop red wax on a phoenix hair pin in ancient times where the hair pin belongs to an Imperial Concubine or the Empress, you'd be put to death immediately because it looks like a bloodied phoenix. 

But a phoenix in Chinese culture is not a red bird. It is a colourful bird."

It’s just that television and movies have taught our society that a woman staying in her traditional role is a bad thing. They made it look ugly when patriarchal characters on TV shows would yell, “There’s only 2 places where a woman belongs! The kitchen and the bedroom!” And then when women started to fight back in the next set of episodes, that helped to fuel the mindset of not needing men. 

And it’s interesting when you watch a KS video about this topic, the woman will argue every last little point until he says, “you went from two incomes to one income, and you went from a two parent household to a single parent household. And now that you’re taking on 100% of all of the responsibilities and the bills and the duties of the household, how is that better?”

We do it in response to Gods love for us. When it comes to good works, all people for the most part have the capability of doing good. The issue isn’t the good works we do or not. The issue is the sin that we commit. Sin will be judged one day. It was already judged on the cross for those who put their faith in Christ. Someone can feed a person all the days of their life and that’s good and awesome, but if they are not leading others into a relationship with Jesus for eternal life, then what good do those works really do? Their sin still remains on them and though they are blessed materially, they are still headed for judgment if they are an unbeliever due to their sin. The judge does not care about all the good deeds that a convicted felon has done throughout his life, but the crime he committed. It’s basically like robbing an old lady walking down the street for a “good cause” in order to feed the hungry people around you. That’s not justice. We all need the blood of Jesus."

Shit the worst thing Romney said during his campaign was that dumb shit about ""binders full of women"" and that thing about a certain % of people not ever voting for him, so his campaign shouldn't focus on the lost causes (democrats/some independents). 

Everything is always, **always** ""oh that isn't legal for Trump to do, that's not how things work"" until he just up and does it and then.....nothing. No consequences. no nothing.

They are always the same places. Perhaps they are comforting? The one that pops up very often is me standing under some trees, lookin at a trailer on my grandmother's campground. I cannot remember the day it happened, but it must have been at least 40 years ago. The trailer belonged to a retired couple. I never talked to the people, the only thing else which stands out regarding the trailer is that once a cow puts its head inside the attached tent. I can recall that picture too, but my mind's eye never goes back to it. Just the one of a trailer + tent. 

The other odd thing about this memory is when I think about it, my mind seems to have an itch, which can be scratched by making a motion somewhere in front of my right eye, somewhat to the right forward and to the left. It is very faint feeling, but whenever my mind's eye goes back to that visual memory, something is making this particular movement in my brain. Like a tic in Tourette's, but then in my brain. Super vague, I know.

There is one more place on the campground which keeps popping up. I must have been about 2 years old when I saw it. Bizarre it has been with me all this time. I cannot remember what I ate for breakfast, but have (think?) a super sharp mind's eye which can clearly see how things were more than 45 years ago. Most of the color seems to be lost though.

Something that has piqued my interest is the fact that Genshin devs never seem to do things correctly. In Mondstadt and Liyue the puzzles were too samey, so they changed them. In Inazuma they were too hard, so they dumbed them down. Then in Sumeru they were too easy. People still complained about Genshin being too samey, so they changed things, and now people like you say the things they added don't belong because this doesn't feel like Genshin anymore. Back when Wriothesley was added people were complaining about too many male characters being added in a row (Cyno, Wanderer, Alhaitham, Mika, Kaveh, Baizhu, Lyney, Wriothesley, Freminet and Neuvillette added between 3.0 and 4.1), now people complain about too many females (literally everyone but Gaming, Sethos, Kinich and Ororon since 4.2, plus Mavuika, Citlali, Iansan, Lan Yan, Skirk, Mizuki, Varesa and another as of yet unknown character having been announced, with only 2 men making that list of announced characters: Ifa and Dahlia). When they do A it's bad, if they take it back it's bad, if instead they do B to counter it it's bad, if they leave it as is it's bad. Everything is bad when the game is so good that people have so few actual problems with it that they have to spend their time nitpicking ""problems"" related to their own preferences so they can complain."

A lot of shops seem to think it's a good idea to start the new guy off on the most monotonous stuff, because people tend to look at it as menial. Treat milling parts or assembly as som sort of upper echelon thing. I think it's basically a hazing process. I took that behavior for granted until I started my own shop, where I do everything. Sanding is monotonous, but it's certainly not menial. Build a perfect door, perfectly centered panel, perfectly square, and give it a shit sanding job. Now it's a piece of garbage. 

If you want to learn to do other tasks, I'd make that desire known to the people in charge. If they give you some line about needing to pay your dues as a sander for 38 hours a week, I'd honestly find another shop to work at.  

Honestly, if my head isn't in it, just about everything can be monotonous. Feeding parts through a shaper or mounting hinges for hours or building face frames over and over...there's a lot of repetition. I'm able to break up my day when I feel like that, which is probably bad for production, but good for my head. Or, I put ear buds in under my muffs and listen to a book or podcasts when I don't have to think about numbers. That may be very against the rules in a multi person shop though."

Some documents refer to governorate (**gubernija**) instead of to specific cities, towns, or villages. This would be analogous to referring to a US state. The same type of thing can even happen in the US. For example, if someone were from Buffalo a document might say New York, but that would not necessarily mean they were from New York City.

Alytus was very close to the border, formed by the river Nemunas, between the Vilna Governorate and the Suwałki Governorate (which was administratively part of Congress Poland). As Žagariai is on the right bank of the river, I believe it would have belonged to Vilna Governorate. See [this map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lithuania-1867-1914-EN.svg).

By the way, to bolster the connection to Žagariai, Alytus district, over Žagarė, Joniškis district, the Geni site mentions that one of his relatives in Lithuania had the surname Ražanauskas. According to the Lithuanian surname dictionary, 75% of families with that surname lived in/near Butrimonys.

Es ist extrem viel psychosomatisches dabei. Jungen Frauen die jede Woche auf der Matte stehen wegen Brustschmerzen, Schmerzende Muskeln nach Krafttraining, juckende Eier, Magenschmerzen nach Döner und was nicht alles. 
Da diejenigen rausziehen die echt was haben ist eine Kunst. Noch dazu sind immer die jüngsten Assistenten in der Notaufnahme. Denen kann man gar keine Vorwürfe machen. 

Aortenruptur ohne Fraktur des Brustkorbs an irgendeiner Stelle, keine Herzkontusion durch ein Gewicht hört sich sehr merkwürdig an und extrem selten und unwahrscheinlich. Ich denke ein Unfallchirurg hätte auf dem Sono auch eh nichts erkannt. Aortenruptur finde ich auch für einen erfahrenen Sonografeur teilweise sehr schwer zu erkennen. Ich habe Degum III und sehe auch nicht immer alles. Was eine Ärztegewerkschaft damit zu tun haben soll verstehe ich jetzt gar nicht?

Ich finde es unangenehm wenn die Leute so ein Theater machen wegen Bagatellen, am besten noch mit 30 Verwandten im Schlepptau und beleidigt sind wenn man dem halt nicht mehr als 5 Min Aufmerksamkeit schenkt. Hatte schon einige mit einfach nur Verstopfung und überfressen. Völlig unabhängig wo die herkommen mögen. 
Genauso reinkommen und aggressiv rumschreien und irgendwas verlangen mit irren Erpressungsversuchen weil man im Grunde genau weiß man hat nichts in der Notaufnahme zu suchen hat aber aus Narzismuss und Bequemlichkeit alles sofort will und das zu der Zeit die man sich ausgesucht hat, gerne nachts um 3 Uhr.
Ich breche sowas immer konsequent sofort ab, stelle klar das es mir egal ist ob die Leute da sind oder nicht da sie ja was von mir wollen und ich nicht von ihnen, nur zur Notfallversorgung verpflichtet bin und sie natürlich rauswerfen kann wenn sie sich nicht vernünftig verhalten.
Meistens ist dann Schluss und es geht. 
Die Rassismuskarte wird von Menschen mit Migrationshintergründen auch immer gerne rausgeholt. 
Was ich mich immer frage ist wie Ärzte und Pflege wohl damit in den Herrkunftsländern umgehen? Ich denke nicht, dass die Händchen halten wenn jmd mit so Bagatellkram kommt sich aber wie irre gebärdet? So viel Zeit hat ja kein Mensch"

It's always a good idea to check any above number(s) on [a carrier lookup tool](https://freecarrierlookup.com/) ([click here](https://800forall.com/SearchWhoOwns.aspx) for a toll-free lookup tool) before calling them to avoid calling a legitimate business, residential number, or private cell number. To do this, lookup the phone number on the carrier lookup and look at the results. If the results says that the number belongs to a residential carrier (ex. AT&T/""Cingular Wireless"", Verizon Wireless, Metro PCS, Rogers, etc.), *DO NOT* call the number.

If the post is still up, please report the post so a mod can remove it to prevent innocent people from receiving these calls. Alternatively, send the moderators a message through the modmail with the link to the offending post.

The above also applies to comments that have numbers too. Thanks!

You and I will disagree about a great many things, but I remain unpersuaded that Musk has or will commence a campaign of bannage against crtics.  If past is prelude, even in the most charitable view--assuming everything you say is true--we're looking at a small handful of incidents of silencing critics.  And, as I said, I think there is a fair view contrariwise.  

You readily point to other issues of bias and why you don't like him and so on.  Because your position seems to be informed by something other than evidence as to silencing critics, I am unpersuaded that this has been or will be a problem. 

On Bluesky, I was recently told by its algorithm that I might want to follow AOC and some other individuals I have absolutely no interest in following.  I have never had this on x/twitter, even though the only people on Bluesky that I follow are also people I formerly followed on x or also follow on x.

The designer of this car, Hans Trippel, had a lifelong obsession with amphibious vehicles and very good connections with the Nazi party so, after the Nazi invasion of France he got a very nice expropriated factory in annexed Alsace-Lorraine to build this car: Bugatti's.


He was however so crap at running the factory (and the SG6 so inferior as an amphibious vehicle to the Beetle-derived Schwimmwagen)  that the Nazis ended up firing him after a while.


After the war and some forced inactivity (he didn't fare well before denazification panels, and the French went after him for pinching Bugatti), he found a wealthy backer for the series production of a civilian-market-oriented amphibious vehicle: the Amphicar. Who was the backer? Harald Quandt, who happened to be Magda Goebbels' son from her first marriage. The Amphicar was a commercial flop, but Quandt made a more successful investment in the automobile industry when he rode to the rescue of a bankrupt BMW in the late 1950s..."

2,2024-12-22,u/janno288,https://www.reddit.com/r/highvoltage/comments/1hjgxxo/vttc_grid_load_impedance_math_question/m3bw12j/,"Grid leak is a very interesting topic.

Sort explaination, when the feedback coil winding is positive current flows through the grid because its acting as a diode, limited by the resistor.
The capacior is able to charge up by the grid current and will then be used to keep the grid negative when the tube is meant to shut off. (keeping in in class C operation) (very short explaination)

Anyway its Main purpose is to bias the tube grid.
For thr GU-81M the grid drive needs to be positive since in the way its typically configured as a triode or  triode with a suppressor grid the tube conducts nearly no current without grid bias.
The grid bias on these low amplification factor (μ/mu / transconductance) needs to be quite strong.

The components are non critical but typically grid resistors should be in the high 100 Ohm range and the capaciors should be in the 10nF range for classic VTTC setup. (100kHz to 5 MHz or so)

Incandescent bulbs are preffered for VTTC use because their resistance increases as they heat up so at the start it gives a big kick into the tube grid to start it up since it needs to develop grid bias in a few cycles.

typically people use a 1/3 ratio between primary and feedback coils.

The GU-81 is a bit more special since it includes 2 internal RF bypass capacitors between grid 2 ans the filament ends. in total its around 800pF between g2 and K, the voltage rating on them seems to be 2kV (breakdown 2.2-2.5kV) so you need to be careful with your grid drive and be careful and tune the coil correctly before you power it up since an arcover or way too high grid drive can cause a breakdown of those capaciors. Typically they are not a problem during VTTC or HFVTTC operation since generally feedback voltages tend to stay under or about -1kV.

For the GU-81(M) in triode mode in ""CW"" the maximum current is 0.6A with the maximum stress limit being 0.7A if you go over you overdissipate the grids to such an extend that they melt and g1 shorts out the filament with 1A cathode current (ask me how i know) 

For the power supply you need to find the point of maximum power because at maximum current you have no voltage and at maximum voltage you habe no current. 
You need to find the perfect ballance between them.
for a Medium sized microwave transformer i found that the maximum power point is when the tube is conducting 0.5A or so, but your results may varry.
But 1/3 ratio is a good starting point.

There are a lot of other topologies but the armstrong oscillator is preffered since you dont need a lot of expensive components and the simplicity of General construction. (in difference to a hartley or push pull driven vttc)

You need to be mindful that your primary frequency equals your secondary frequency, for that attaching a scope to the feedback on the grid and a scope antenna picking up the voltage of the secondary is a good idea and checking if the frequencies match. 
They should be as close as you can (mind that large arcs will lower the frequency of the secondary so you may need to add another turn on your primary) 
Online calculatiors for tesla coil resonance frequency are accurate to get you in the same range or so. 
Ramping up the oscillator power while the frequencies are out of tune are not recommended and it may even cause arcovers to happen not to mention that the arc if it does occur will be way louder than it should. 

So back to your original question the grid impedence is a complex topic and is non linear to start out with but generally for these tubes the grid impedence is quite low, light bulbs are a good indicator for grid current, for thr GU-81(M) it seems like the grid current is around 200-300mA"

When we rented a new Tesla on a trip, he spent all his time while driving fiddling with the features on the touchscreen and snapped at a friend when that friend asked him to focus on the road during heavy traffic. Every woman he has had a breakup or fling that went bad with, he immediately dismisses as ""crazy"" despite his choices often being the cause.

He is a really great guy in most ways, but doesn't read people well and has not shown any inclination to put in the effort to try to improve at it. Reallg trying does make a difference."

Now, here's the kicker: The insurance companies, Like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, *also* own the pharmacy (Carelon). Blue cross ALSO owns the PBM. So Anthem BC/BS (emphasis on the *BS*) owns the PBM that negotiates with themselves and the pharmacy (Carelon) which they *also* own.

The 80kWh charge-up before leaving cost me ~$5 of lost NSC + NBCs thanks to home solar.

With ~$4 gas, that $45 energy cost is like getting 50mpg basically, about what a Prius gets. 

Haven't tried Toyota's lane-keeping but I don't think they update the software like Tesla is  doing (FWIW I used the free FSD trial on this trips and it was overall very smooth, the only negative was about every 10 miles it wouldn't route around an upcoming slowpoke in the lane the most optimally)

The Prius Hybrid does 0 to 60 in 7 seconds now, vs under 5 in my AWD.

Not sure what trim level the 2025 Prius matches for the MY, but my late 2023 cost $40K OTD after $10,500 in gov't cash so it'd be tough for a Prius to cost less.

So no regrets, LOL, even though the Prius probably does have a lower TCO over say 100,000 miles, though the required ICE maintenance and hassle makes that dubious I guess . . ."

These are not major issues and restarting is not a major nuisance, but my experience so far is the Rivian software is significantly more buggy than Tesla software. 

I’m honestly a bit concerned how Rivian can have just a few SKUs yet have software so buggy. Seems like there is a pretty significant failure in their process and controls for their SDLC behind the scenes here."

You sometimes don't need to be in the office to do the work you're supposed to do, especially if the majority of it doesn't actually require your presence. Most people can access their company's systems on any computer and don't actually require physical presence to input shit on a spreadsheet or do their entire job through email. Is there any reason someone HAS to be at the office other than some petty manager who wants to get off on the fact that employees are seeing him walk around and micromanage?

This isn't even factoring in that fElon's email here requires *40 fucking hours* of in-office time a week, which is the standard 40 hour work week, before he'll allow them to work remotely. This means he's *only* going to let you work remotely on overtime, which is just beyond fucked up.

In this digital age, physical presence in the work place just isn't needed anymore. Hell, some businesses would save MORE money by having a smaller building for just the people who need to be present, rather than having a massive office building, cleaning staff, lighting, AC, etc., for the entire workforce.

It's a dictatorship if anyone does what the BoS do. It'd be just as bad if the Enclave did it. Or the NCR. Etc. 


It didn't belong to the BoS at all. Just because the scientists never got to finish it doesn't mean they don't own it. The BoS were hired to offer support defending against mutants so the scientists could keep working. At no point did anyone ever sign ownership over to the BoS. Once again I have to point out, might doesn't = right, they don't own it just because they defended it. 


Oh? The BoS only target certain groups? And that makes it alright? Oh OK then. That doesn't sound remotely troubled does it? Again with the you'd enjoy a dictatorship bit. 


Veterans take part in war. That's a whole topic that is not going to be covered properly as part of a discussion about Fallout, but they kill and are killed on the orders of politicians and businessmen. Once again you're missing the whole point of Fallout. You aren't meant to think that because they're veterans they're inherently good and deserve to be able to take control by force. Also these games take place long after the war, these people did not witness the war they just live in its aftermath, same as any other wastelander.
You can't just decide you get to ""police"" anything or anyone by force. That's dictatorship behaviour. Again, they weren't asked for, not voted in, it's flat out wrong. 


Their core belief is that technology is dangerous and people can't be trusted with it, but they can, just because they can. You can cherry pick all you want, there is very obviously a point made by the writers in designing a faction around that core belief. They're not genuinely shining knights and heroes to the people. If you actually believe that they're purely intending to do good and there's no element of control in their structure, once again, I'm sorry but you're an idiot. 


Lyons wanted to actually help the people in the area as opposed to just mindlessly follow orders and traditions and gather technology just because that's what they do, and it gets them power. The whole point is that he was an off shoot from the core BoS because he actually did care about the locals.


You literally just admitted you think might=right. Again with the you clearly like dictatorships thing. You realise Fallout is taking the piss of people like you, right?

To answer your post, i think that part of it is social engineering from above, which can also be named as politicization.   
As in many areas you have a conflict organized between two groups in the population.   
Group 1 : is right about A, is wrong about B, is silent or wrong about C  
Group 2: is wrong about A, is right about B, is silent or wrong about C

The two groups fight other subjects A and B, each of them finding good reasons to belong to group 1 or group 2.  
Them hating the other group lead them to strengthen the feeling of belonging to their own group. As a result they will also believe the fake things that are said by the leaders of their own group: this is group thinking.  
And since they focus on subjects A and B. Neither of the group will think about subject C or they won't question the fake things that are being said about subject C."

Yet, it is humans alone who imbue this event with meaning, who transform it into art, ritual, and celebration, year after year, with unwavering devotion. Why? Because they cannot separate themselves from the world, the Earth. They see their existence as inseparable from the Earth's essence, incapable of envisioning a planet devoid of human life. But the stark truth remains: even in our absence, the Earth would continue its ceaseless journey, spinning and revolving as it always has. We are not as indispensable as we like to believe. In reality, we are but an afterthought in the grand scheme of existence, irrelevant to the vast mechanisms of the cosmos. Yet, this truth is unbearable to us.

The US political system is flooded with money from donors and lobbying groups representing monied interests. In the past... 40 years, we had a Bush - then a Clinton - then a Bush - then Obama (who is somewhat of an aberration, but not much of one), who won narrowly in the primaries against a Clinton - then a billionaire (or, self-proclaimed billionaire anyway, but who knows) in Trump - who won narrowly against a Clinton - then Biden, who won by default because he was running against the deeply unpopular Trump (who, remember, is a billionaire, apparently) - then Trump again. And during this whole period, buzzing around in the background, are figures like Kennedy family.

You can blatantly see the political facade at play. Bush and Obama, supposed great political enemies, are now seemingly best buds because they both belong to the political and economic elite. As much as I despise Trump, he's unique in the sense that at least almost everyone seems to openly or secretly dislike him. He is still an oligarch though (who immediately, upon gaining power, made clear his intention to make any legal troubles he might have go away).

However quite aside from that, how can someone who owns their own social media platform - through which they strictly control criticism of themself, promote propaganda and misinformation that agrees with their personal political position - has the ear of the president - is the world's richest person - not be described as an oligarch?

>largely controlled by rich elites like George soros

Indeed, Soros, or the Koch Brothers (until one of them thankfully died), or... supposed billionaire Donald Trump for example? The US is a democracy by political mechanism, but it's deeply undemocratic, and Musk is a huge glaring symptom of that.

From another post, here’s yet another guy arguing that Musk is simply “a concerned citizen with his right to an opinion”:

> Beg pardon but who are you to say what matters to the voting base?  I’m a member of that “voting base” and I don’t have an issue with Musk.
> 
> He’ll be a part of DOGE which will, apparently, have some influence in determining the size of the government.  However, H1B issues...that’s INS and the State Department...not DOGE.
> 
> The man is allowed to have an express an opinion and we’re SUPPOSED to be the ones who claim everyone’s free to voice their opinion without penalty...or being “shown the door”.

Everyone is free to voice their opinion, just not on r/Conservative of course."

It's like watching two 10 year olds fight, neither side can make a convincing argument or really understands the subject matter and both sides are far too stubborn to back down. 

It also just kind of reeks of American exceptionalism? I almost lost my shit when Reika, a *Japanese woman* belonging to a *feudalistic clan* explained to some aliens how the reason Jake just wanted to be treated like a random dude is because:

>.. we come from a world with a modern culture focused heavily on individualism and a belief in personal freedom and equality. At least, the parts of the world we were from. No one was inherently superior to others—we believed they weren’t, anyway—and anyone claiming to be better due to their inborn traits was heavily ostracized and looked down upon.

Honestly, the story would be way better if they stopped trying to justify everything as superior Earth culture and just boiled it down to Jake's personal preference (because at the end of the day that's all it fucking is). The progression parts are great though."

If you use Musk's numbers, lithium looks great. If you use any actual expert's numbers, it's pretty rough. Large lithium batteries are wildly carbon expensive and the production of 200k miles worth of EV battery lifespan is ballpark similar to the production, fueling, and 200k miles driving of an ICE vehicle. Once you factor in any of the EV assembly, energy creation, charging inefficiency, etc etc for EVs they pretty much uniformly fall behind. It's a newer tech with bad infrastructure that is naturally more carbon intensive vs a tech with over a century of optimization and infrastructure spanning the globe down to the city level. It's a stacked deck and progress will eventually overcome that, but right now EVs are ""the future"" and lithium is one of several anchors holding them back."

Che Guevara was born into an upper-middle class Argentine family and had a promising career as a doctor ahead of him. He walked away from all of that after witnessing the abject poverty most of mid-20th century Latin America lived under, during his famous motorcycle trip, with many instances of that being attributable to intervention by the CIA to protect the interests of American corporations.

He became an activist and increasingly radical, and was on Guatemala when the CIA launched their coup of the democratically elected government there in 1954. A government target, he fled to Mexico, where he met the Castro brothers and joined their mission to invade Cuba with less than 100 men on 1 small boat to overthrow the corrupt government of Fulgencio Bautista (also backed by the US.)

During the Cubam insurrection, he transformed from medic to soldier to leader. He always led from the front, frequently noted as being the first to charge enemy positions. When Havana was taken, many government officials were executed and Guevara forced everyone, including the higher-up officer echelon to participate, declaring ""No one's hands are clean in this.""

He served multiple cabinet positions and worked 18 hour days in Castro's government before becoming disillusioned with civil service and desiring to spread revolution further. He traveled to Africa in the 1960's, believing they were ripe for revolutions. However, he was soured by the attitudes of the locals, finding them less interested in the greater good of the people and cause of revolution than simply becoming the next warlords/autocrats. The letters he wrote home expressing his frustration with them did have some racist ideas about the cause between the difference in his experiences between the Latin American and African revolutionaries."

One bill in Missouri would have made it a felony sex crime to assist in someone else’s social transition- barbers would be sex offenders for giving a trans person a haircut, department store cashiers would be sex offenders for selling a trans person a dress, etc. 

Luckily that bill failed, but the point is, they tried to introduce it, and are continuing to throw legislation at us constantly. They claim it’s “just about sports” to hide the fact they’re attacking us at every angle."

Warum Loreal? Hätte mich wahrscheinlich nach dem Master auch dort beworben und dachte mir okay wenn es jetzt schon klappt … why not haha und master dann einfach online irgwndwann machen. Aber natürlich zahlt auch Loreal beim Einstieg mit Master mehr…

As far as the Indian government is concerned you are a Pakistani citizen - just because you/your parents haven’t been for however many years for all intents and purposes if tomorrow you walked into a Pakistani embassy and applied for a passport you would get it. 

To be very clear - not having a Pakistani passport doesn’t mean you are not a citizen. Having a passport is a benefit of being a citizen not a requirement. 

The only way you can apply for an Indian visa on your US passport is if you officially renounce your Pakistani citizenship and use that certificate when applying for an Indian visa. You’ll probably face a bureaucratic nightmare right now because in your mind you’re not a Pakistani citizen but by heritage you technically are. Quote from the Pakistani nationality law Wikipedia page: Children born overseas are automatically Pakistani citizens by descent if either parent is a citizen otherwise than by descent or is employed by the government of Pakistan.

You basically need to: confirm your Pakistani citizenship via the embassy then renounce it which will give you a Pakistani Origin Card, which allows you lifelong visa free entry into Pakistan, and an official certificate saying you are no longer officially a Pakistani. Then you can apply for the India visa on your US passport. Alternatively, you apply for a Pakistani passport and apply for an India visa on that but that will also be difficult because they don’t issue tourist visas they issue family visit visas which you won’t get as you’re not married to an Indian origin citizen.

Sorry not positive news overall but having been through the troubles of applying for (and traveling on) a Pakistani passport I am a bit too familiar with this topic"

I mean, I could not stop thinking about it. 24 seven….

And I got hooked up with a lot of channels that seemingly just kind of appeared out of nowhere around 2019 and 2020 and I started watching a lot of channels in Cambodia, China etc., and thinking how cute monkeys were and eventually stopped watching all those channels on YouTube because it was pretty evident how these monkeys were being so incredibly abused and it was just so upsetting to me ….. I was literally devastated to see the amount of abuse that was going on on these channels ….. so I started looking for these other kind of content channels where they had monkeys at home where it seemed like to me they were loving them and taking care of them and I thought oh this is a much better way of watching monkeys than what I was seeing on those  Cambodian and China channels ……. That’s how I 
ending up on these nutty people’s channel….. 🙄

Obviously, I’ve done a lot of research in the past five -6 years and realize that owning a monkey is not all that’ it’s cracked up to be not to mention that they’re just NOT pets and I would never have one now …. it’s absolutely inhumane man to take these poor babies away from their mothers like that I mean, they belong with their mothers in the wild and that’s the end of it.  

But honestly, watching these 2, it has just turned me off in a way that I find words hard to describe it. I started realizing how much abuse was going on even in this particular setting, and it was often sometimes subtle, but eventually it became really evident that they were just straight up abusing these animals ! 😵 and I was outraged! 

Of course I was gonna stop watching them, but when I started voicing my opinions on how I thought she was abusing these monkeys of course I got banned instantly, which is fine. I don’t need to watch their content, but it was hard for me to realize that people just love to abuse these poor little creatures…. Like I don’t get it. How really sick do you have to be to impose such pain and strife on these little innocent animals who should never have been taken from their mothers in the first place? How sick are you? 

Everything must stink to  high heavens over there and There’s no way that they’re cleanly people.  There’s just no way that they’re neat and clean and taking care of themselves let alone taking care of those monkeys like I don’t think they do jack shit but sit on their ass 24 seven and post bullshit videos.  

just watching the abuse is absolutely gut wrenching….. they are no better than any of those stupid Cambodian channels. I was watching where they were just straight up molesting monkeys, and horribly abusing them. I mean they’re no better than those people …….and their attitudes and their display of indifference to people who follow them and support them has just made me physically ill to even look at them anymore…..Let alone actually hear their voices. Oh my God it sends me off into the ozone.  just hearing the sound of their voice is so grating  to my nerves that I’d almost rather have a root canal, then listen to it. 

There is absolutely nothing to be jealous of these people over and if they actually think people are jealous of them, they are so incredibly disillusioned and mentally disturbed that it’s shocking to me that they’re still allowed to even have any monkeys,  let alone, holy crap Irene,  they’ve got nine now ??? How in God‘s earth are they getting away with this shit? 9??? 
NINE??? 😵

There’s no possible way that you can care for nine monkeys like that I’m sorry,  it’s just impossible …. not only do they not have the space for it with these little cages but they also don’t have the heart for it and I’m guessing they don’t have the money for it either which is why they’re always dry begging.  

In my opinion, they’re disgusting human beings…. I got blocked early on… (boo hoo) and you know what,  I only come to these pages to see what’s going on because I’m waiting for the day that someone posts about how they finally had all their monkeys taken away….. That’s literally all I’m waiting to hear now……

They can take that jealousy conversation and stuff  it up their own stinky butts because they’re delusional a-holes. Nobody is jealous of them, but I think they do prey on the weak which is probably the only supporters and followers they really have….. nobody with a functioning brain in their skull would follow these people and think they’re normal and fun and entertaining and interesting or even anything to be jealous of. 

They are at the bottom of the barrel in my opinion ….. just waiting for the day that they lose it all…. i’ll be happy about that day."

Economics professor, Catherine Pakaluk, has eight children and says: “There was this sense that, ‘Oh, this isn’t getting any harder, in fact, maybe it’s getting easier’,” she mused on motherhood. “I can only describe it like an athlete getting a high when they’re at peak performance. The feeling that it’s not hard any more, but everything you did to get there was hard.”

So she decided to have four more, stopping only when she found herself, aged 40, physically unable to carry another.

Pronatalism, literally meaning pro-birth, is a broad ideological movement driven by concern that the world is no longer producing enough children and that society should do something to fix it."

I won't mention all the improvements, even the important ones (more options for interacting with the door, customization, influence of sound on stealth etc.).

When you're making a post with the intent to compare two games belonging to the same genre but that released around fifteen years apart and find out which one is better, I think it's downright essential to list and elaborate on what you think are the most important improvements, at the very least, actually.

>It is important to take into account the context of the time - at one time, SWAT 4 was not particularly praised for its graphics or gunplay. But RoN will still be one of the best (and in many ways the best) games for enjoying shooting in 2025. Character models are pretty bad, but the lighting and maps are beautiful.

And call me crazy, but for a tactical FPS, graphics and gunplay are some of the least important aspects. Maybe more important for younger players, sure, and admittedly I wouldn't know, but there's a reason games like Rogue Spear, Raven Shield and SWAT 3 are still considered the pinnacle of the genre to this day, and it sure as shit isn't because of either of those things."

From Dinosaurs and monster trucks to Linebackers and rock bands, male growth is essentially just finding the next idol to attach their ingrained appreciation of strength to. I remember when I first laid eyes on a big black cock in the locker room. It's heavy weight and pendulous swing stirred the same emotions in my gut as all those old boy hood idols had before. It was Rocky and Rambo, Everest and Empire State Building, countless thousands of examples of power and glory all rolled into 10 inches of ebon masculine musk. I'm in my 20s, but I've been a pussyfree interracial porn addict for 10 years, and through the evolution of thoughts and emotions I've had towards Black men and their incredible manhoods, the underlying motivation has always remained: ""Bro, Big Black Cocks are like Really Cool and Beautiful and Powerful and SUPER mega badass, dude!""


I think appealing to this aspect of the male psyche is a winning strategy to get more whitebois, and even white MEN, towards accepting the BNWO. If you're not an athlete you can still cheer for the touchdown, if you're not a musician you can still sing along to your favorite artist, and if you can't satisfy a woman, you can still have a mind blowing orgasm and fulfilling sex life watching a real man do what he was put on this earth to do. Make sex a spectator sport and give a whiteboi a ticket."

They sound creepy, to say the least but I’m glad you have your girlfriend there so you guys can support and validate each other that this is really happening. 

There’s a common side effect after witnessing a UFO called “the hitchhiker effect.” Even if your building were latently haunted, I wouldn’t be surprised if the hitchhiker effect isn’t the cause of the increase and strength of these paranormal experiences. I’d recommend looking this effect up if only to help diffuse some of your fear. This is a perfectly normal and widely experience aspect of these phenomenon. 

I’d also recommend any sort of protective and cleansing rituals your chosen spiritual path might recommend. First, do the cleanse ritual(s) - the more the better really. Then do the protective rituals. 

For example, if you’re a Christian, maybe burn some frankincense (rocks or incense - whatever feels the most correct and meaning to you both) while saying some cleansing prayers. Then say some protective prayers. If you’re Catholic, you could also invoke some saints and archangels - like the Archangel Michael, warrior of the archangels. Things like that. Imagine him guarding all your windows and doors with his flaming sword. Things are being weird - GET WEIRD BACK. ESTABLISH BOUNDARIES. Then mentally and/or out loud say that you do you not want,  or do you allow, and entities, spirits, aliens, or anything else to enter your space or violate your personal space or that of your partner. Keep doing this until it works. If it doesn’t die down, maybe consult a religious to cleanse and bless/fortify your space, etc. 

If you belong to other traditions, there are equivalent practices you can do. What will be most effective will be that which you both believe in. If you have different faiths, you should each do your own practices. 

Those would be my recommendations. I hope this helps you both!"

If people can present another person held for these charges and to this degree then you have an argument.  Also. Hunter showed up to testify publicly and Republicans didn't like that... Why?

I view relationships less as a life long commitment and more as an energy exchange, a way to grow and experience things, to help one another to heal or to learn. We are very drawn to the people we need to make an exchange with because of subconscious indicators that we pick up.

I honestly don't think that most relationships are meant to last for life but that the way our society is set up and becuase of a lack of resource, we are highly incentivised to stick together regardless of whether core attraction wanes or not. There is also  lot of guilt and shame around breaking down relationships that have lost that core attraction becuase of the dependency we end up having on others.

To me this is why there is such a focus on 'working' on marriage. To me, it just really isn't that hard of you genuinely want to be and stay with someone. But I think those relationships are rare, like hens teeth rare, most of us are just here to share for a while, grow and move on but we're caught in a net which stops that becuase of resource and attachment, rather than actual love.

Love to me is free, it's a choice. I would never want a man who could have his head turned by someone else so easily because I would know that there was something gone internally and that I could try and focus on getting it back but for what purpose and how long? 

Attachment and love are two very different things. Attachment is dependent, it clings and it grasps, desperate to hold on to what it feels it owns or belongs to it. One person cannot own another regardless of what commitments were made earlier in life or how they've come to fruition. This is why you must always retain a level of independence so that your partner is free to choose you and doesn't stay because he feels obligated to support you becuase dependence kills love.

Now I don't know where you are on this. Are you afraid of losing the man you love, or are you afraid of losing your security? If its the security, you need to stop and really look at the relationship and what you actually want.

If its love, if you'd let him go rather than tie him to you for your own reasons, tell him that. Love is a choice after all and people are a lot more likely to make it whe they are free, rather than when they feel obligated to a life they are no longer sure they want.

Stay on Topic: All posts and comments must remain on the topic of Historical Romance.  Historical Romance is defined in our community as a romance that is set in the past. This means it must fulfill the genre criteria of romance: 1) The book would not make sense or feel hollow without the romantic plot. 2) The book requires a HEA (happily ever after) or HFN (happy for now) ending.  Historical fiction with a romance subplot is NOT historical romance.  Romances set in the past but involving fantasy or paranormal beings are NOT historical romance.  We love it, but it doesn't belong here!  Romance books set in the past that were considered contemporary fiction when published such as many of Jane Austen's works (as they were set in a time frame that is now historical to today's readers and the romance genre was not in existence then as it is today) are considered Historical Romance in this community.  The rule of thumb we use is if the romance book is set at least 50+ years ago it can be considered HR in this sub as the majority of our readers were not of adult age at the time of publication.  We do allow time travel romances to be discussed in this community as long as the vast majority of the book occurs in the past and the story is not a traditional straight paranormal or fantasy romance.  We recommend that posts/comments involving paranormal or fantasy elements be reposted in r/paranormalromance and posts/comments involving science fiction elements be reposted to r/ScienceFictionRomance."

Note that this never works out in the long run, and the paramilitaries almost always lose as they tend to be far less competent in an actual fight.

Their purpose won't be to counter the military, it will be to terrorize immigrants, then political dissenters and rivals. Once he creates the framework for this force and fills it with extremist loyalists, they will have access to the same weapons and technology as the military and will also have the full power of the United States surveillance apparatus at their disposal. Bush and Obama made a giant misstep by allowing and furthering the Patriot Act. Homeland security and the NSA will provide actionable information to this SS like group to round up people and they will use their misinformation platform to render them guilty before a mock trial. 

The giant makeshift tent prisons will become more permanent and start to house anyone that speaks against the government. The inhabitants will be slaves for cheap manufacturing labor and it will be celebrated as a solution to the costs of housing so many prisoners that can't be quickly deported, or who will have to wait years for the completely overburdened legal system to hear their case, because they are deemed dangerous enemies of the state. This is how they will prop up the economy after replacing income taxes with blanket tariffs... To start with..

As long as the people in this country fear and hate each other we will be victims of the oligarchs. Make no mistake, this is the billionaires finally closing their grip on America and taking control. Collectively they know Trump won't be able to maintain control for long so they're taking position to grab power.. look at Elon Musk.. and Peter Thiel's proxy JD Vance.."

What kind of time people get on those types of charges depends heavily on past criminal record so it is hard to say more than that.

I am glad to hear your custody judge is taking it seriously (and that you are also taking it seriously), the more people you can find in your life that will support you on that the easier it will be for you to stay on track going through this.

He can't do a non-broad pardon because we don't know what Trump will attempt to get them on. It more than likely won't be as easy to guess as being related to their work.

Do you realize the scale of ""all Americans"" vs. ""like 5 Americans?"" It would be a shame if we find out all of the people he's pardoning now did awful crimes, but it's not as bad as if he pardoned thousands of people who did do crimes along with millions who didn't.

I don't know what your big thing about saying the justice system is corrupt and reliable is all about. It's got a lot of problems, and Trump has tried to use it to go after his enemies before, and Trump is more willing than ever to further corrupt it to go after his enemies now. The only one here suggesting it's both reliable and corrupt is you. Trump probably won't succeed at putting anybody away, but 1. Why risk allowing people to go to jail for crimes they didn't commit, and 2. Even if he doesn't succeed, forcing these people to get lawyers to defend themselves still costs them time and resources, so it is a form of retribution even if he fails.

And before you come back trying to tell me I'm supporting the elite over the rest of us again, I am not. As I keep saying in like every comment, my position is that Biden should pardon anybody with _credible_ threats of retribution from Trump regardless of wealth, position, political alignment or whatever other idea you'll make up. If there is no _credible_ threat of retribution from Trump, then there is no need for a pardon. I don't need a pardon. My wife's relatively rich uncle doesn't need a pardon. Elon Musk doesn't need a pardon. These people, who Trump said he will use the justice system against, have a _credible_ threat of retribution from Trump and need some form of protection against it."

I realize I said 10  years which would make it long term.

My point is that wealth is different than income and people don't seem to understand that and then get offended about how wealthy people pay ""very little"" in income tax relative to their wealth. 

Taxing Elon 100% of his income because he wealth is over 1 billion would mean that he would have to bleed off $399.9 billion dollars of his wealth in order keep any money. 

Since almost all of his wealth is capital gains and almost all of his money is tied up is assets, he would probably stave to death from not being able to afford food before he was able to get any money from his assets. 

There are also sec regulatory guidelines around when and how much stock he can sell, etc. 

Not to mention it would completely trash the Tesla stock *and* any other fund that is holding a reasonable amount of Tesla stock, not to mention put a big dent in the stock market as a whole. And that's just Tesla, that doesn't include all the other billionaires and their assets."

>On March 15, 2019, at approximately 1:40 PM local time, Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian gym trainer with no previous criminal history who was active on extreme-right internet forums, entered the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he allegedly shot dead 42 people. Exiting the mosque, he allegedly shot another person on the pavement before driving the short distance to Linwood mosque where he allegedly continued his killing spree. In the space of 36 minutes, Tarrant allegedly killed 49 people. Two more subsequently died of their wounds, bringing the death toll to 51. New Zealand, which until this point had experienced terrorism as a “latent” threat rather than a “lived reality,” suffered the single largest loss of life to terrorism in its history.

3,2024-12-17,u/ShortyColombo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1hfvw2p/san_diego_vs_miami/m2i9fea/,"Miami is vibrant and interesting. There's always some sort of event, pop-up, museum, club, theater, you name it. We can always find something to do, way beyond clubbing or going to the beach (two activities I ironically don't really enjoy, so you know I've been boots to the ground looking for 'em!). 

I personally had a lot more luck making friends here than I ever did living in DC, I can't keep up with how social I am here.  It does help that I am Latina and speak Spanish, so culturally I fit a bit better. Yes, the stereotype of the ""influencer"" people is absolutely true, but as long as you stick to your interests and hobbies, you absolutely find the normal shmoes- I work in arts and theater and tend to meet my people in those environments. The Adrienne Arscht Center has been great in that regard. 

Big, giant caveat here that I moved to Miami with my husband, so, obviously I can't say much about the dating scene when it comes to personal experience. But from the many female single friends I have made, the hetero consensus seems to be ""great city to have a bit of fun, lots of options, but huge nightmare to find lasting connection or lifelong partner"". I always hear complaints about the focus on looks and money. Gay consensus is pretty similar, especially the looks complaint, and my lesbian friends are just begging to find more queer women here 😅 

Cost of living is high and local wages don't reflect that. That's pretty standard for Florida in general but egregious here in particular. 

I hope anything here helps with your decision!"

Globally, women, non-whites, lgbtq, disabled, and children (this is not an exhaustive list) are losing BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. It's not simplistic to identify and point out the underlying causes that the top 1% are weaponizing to get what they want, which is power. In order for the Musks, Thiels, and Bezos's of the world to continue to make staggering amounts of money which translates into power, they need an impoverished underclass. How do you get that? Turn them on one another while you rob them both blind. 

You wanna dive deeper? Okay. Let's talk about how Hillary Clinton has been villified by the GOP -and- the mainstream media since her husband first took office. She took flack for everything from her hairstyle to her husband's decisions. She stood by her man and she took flack for that. Let me spell that out for the hard of understanding; she was blamed for her husband's infidelities and then blamed because she chose to forgive him and blamed some more because she stayed. If she'd have strung him up and left his cheating ass she'd have been blamed for that too. Forget that she's a qualified statesperson in her own right she'd be too emotional because women and periods, amirite? There's more but I ain't got the inclination to teach a master class tonight.

Instead of voting for the frankly overqualified white woman in 2016, the electorate decided it'd continue to help the utterly unqualified white man fail upwards to the highest office of the land. Decades of GOP/MSM misogyny distilled into a loss the country will spend a generation trying to recover from, it if ever does.

Joe Biden came out of retirement to postpone our downfall and his reward? Democratic leadership demanded he step aside. To put up yet another overqualified woman but this time she's not fighting against mere misogyny, she's gotta deal with the racism and somehow explain how she's at once too black but not black enough while the now felonious white man fails upwards yet again. 

And here we are, looking at four years out with two losses and we're going to throw yet another qualified woman into the meat grinder when we know that's what the GOP wants because they know they can win against a woman because mysogyny is a fucking feature in our society. Sometimes the simple answer is the right answer even if we don't like it. 

The DNC needs to read the room, find a qualified man who will do right by the people who he's going to represent, and work from there. Aggressively. Nominating another woman is the right wing's wet dream that we can't afford to fulfill."

My room is also pastel pink - I have pink walls with pink and white candy stripe features, the door is pink, a pink TV, pink bookcases, a pink rug, pink lamps, a pink mirror, a pink lampshade for the ceiling light, pink duvets and pillows and blankets! I love Halloween so I have a bunch of Halloween decorations up year round, some of which I've spray painted pink. If something comes in pink, I will get it in pink. I will spend more money to get the same object in pink, knowing that I will take care of it more and that it will look better with my other belongings. A few years ago I even bleached my hair and dyed it pastel pink.

Some people have been a bit rude about it, saying that my bedroom is childish and looks like a kids room. I really couldn't care less.

My boyfriend calls my room ""The Pink Palace"" and he doesn't mind how pink it is at all. He has said that when we buy our own place one day, he will let me decorate however I want and paint the whole house pink, as long as he gets a mancave where he can put all his boy toys and superhero posters and stuff. He often buys me things for my room as a gift.

Try to figure out what you want your character to be like, what background, fantasy/historic, etc then start with your clothing. If that helmet is anything to go with, id say 16th and 17th century clothing would be fine, so musketeers, you mentioned netherlands so 80 years war. In the Netherlands theres a thriving reenactment scene for that period so i guess its fairly easy to get stuff that fits, maybe even used clothing. A simple linen shirt (you need multiple for a week long event), knee length pants/breeches, a brimmed hat (a hat is a must, SUMMER!) and you got a decent base for larp, id personally add a vest or ideally a doublet(a type of jacket typical for the 1600s) and a wool cloak if it rains. During that time, munitions grade armor became really common which is also somewhat reflected in modern armor prices since you might not need the equivalent of a new car to get proper armor thats decent quality. Late medieval on the other hand is hard to pull off right. If you want larp armor thats cheaper, try to stick to simple breastplates and stuff like that, nothing fancy and complicated since that would really need to be custom work, and then were again in the car price range"

I suppose it would be a story about how Kitty became a cat burglar? Like, her life with that family before and after she was abandoned. If done well it could make Kitty a very sympathetic protagonist.

Then, after having been abandoned, Kitty would become jaded and fall in with the criminal underworld of the Shrek universe. Kitty could get involved with some very shady fairy tale characters - ones who might well take advantage of Kitty's abandonment issues and her desire to belong.

Maybe Kitty's movie could be a heist movie with Kitty Softpaws as a cat burglar. The movie could bring back Humpty Dumpty who would also be part of the same heist group Kitty was in.

Or perhaps Kitty and Humpty could be rivals in different criminal groups that decided to work together by the end of the movie and form their own criminal partnership.

Kitty could then end up being betrayed during the heist and decide to go her own way. 

Before doing so, Kitty would double cross her double crosser. Then Kitty would become more selective about who she worked with in the future and team up with Humpty Dumpty since he was someone Kitty felt she could trust.

The movie could end sometime near when Kitty Softpaws met Puss in Boots."

Most docs are very ignorant about PCOS (in terms of proper treatment and in terms of fully understanding the serious long term health risks of improper treatment). Red flags that your doctor is an idiot:  ""There is no treatment, you just need to lose weight"" (note: losing weight often does help but that is often more a symptom of the disorder than a cause and docs often don't understand this); ""Just take the Pill and don't worry about it until you want to get pregnant"" (the Pill can be very useful but does nothing to address the insulin resistance that is usually the driver of the PCOS""; or ""You can't have PCOS (or insulin resistance) b/c you are not overweight"".

You need to see an endocrinologist who specializes in hormone disorders; or if that is impossible, try to find an endo who specializes in insulin resistance/diabetes + a gyno who can help with reproductive symptoms.

2) Most cases of PCOS are driven by insulin resistance. If IR is present, treating it lifelong is foundational to improving the PCOS symptoms (including lack of ovulation/irregular periods) and is also necessary b/c unmanaged IR is usually progressive over time and causes serious health risks. For some people, treating IR is all that is required to regulate symptoms. Treatment of IR is done by adopting a 'diabetic' lifestyle (meaning some type of low glycemic eating plan + regular exercise) and by taking meds if needed (typically prescription metformin and/or the supplement that contains a 40 : 1 ratio between myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol).

3) Many docs are ignorant about how to diagnose early stages of insulin resistance and therefore many patients are incorrectly told they do not have IR and therefore it goes untreated for many years. This is even more true if the patient is lean. It is NOT SUFFICIENT to test only fasting glucose or A1c. I've had IR for >30 years with both of those values being normal. Treating my IR put my long standing PCOS into remission.

4) If you are not on hormonal birth control and are regularly going >3 months without a proper bleed, this can result in buildup of endometrial lining and increased risk of endometrial cancer. This risk is even greater if you are also overweight. Please see your ob/gyn if this is happening; there are a number of treatment options.

5) Be vary wary of PCOS advice given on tiktok or by influencers. A lot of it is garbage."

That is something they're known for! The general catalogue scents are avail in sample sizes so I'd recommend sampling them first! Since they always give you quite a few free samples, you can also request certain free ones in the note at checkout. They've given me the ones I wanted before :)


The first thing that came to mind I think is a fav for a lot of people whi love ambery/resiny stuff is **Sin** (*amber, sandalwood, black patchouli and cinnamon.*). I have it and it is sooo resiny, so ""thick"", both sexy and comforting. It is so nice and so well-blended. I am not the biggest fan of cinnamon, but it is so well-blended here, like if I didn't know there was cinnamon in it, I wouldn't even guess there is cinnamon.


Another ambery, luxuriant and warm and comforting scent that is also loved by many is **Bastet**(*Luxuriant amber, warm Egyptian musk, fierce saffron and soft myrrh, almond, cardamom and golden lotus.*). It is ambery, thick, and so nice.


You might know the scent they are most known for is **Snake Oil** (*deep, rich earthy notes swirled with vegetal musks, sugared vanilla bean, and dark spices.*) but im not sure if it woild be too spice for you? Id say it's still worth getting a sample (maybe mentioning that that's the ine yiy want to be among the free samples). It is very RICH dark vanilla with lots of spices and something earthy. I like it but it is def strong!




For vanillas I am sure lots of people will recommend **Dorian** (*A Victorian fougere with three pale musks and dark, sugared vanilla tea.*) - one of their most known scents and a lot of people's fav. I LOVE Dorian BUT a lot of people mentioned that in the past years it started smelling a bit different when it's fresh, with like less vanilla and more of the weird lemon  thing. I agree with them, the bottle of Dorian I got this year is a bit weird, so I am aging it until it becomes good. However, I also got the **Dorian Hair Gloss**, and that smells *fantastic*! Dark yet ethereal, everything well-blended, there is no citrusiness, and it's soooo pleasant. It also stays in my hair for an extremely long time. I have received numerous compliments on that scent in my hair! There are no citruses in the notes so idk where that weirdness in the fresh bottles comes from, but you can email them with the question, Im sure they'll get back to you fast!






For ethereal vibes and rose my immediate rec is **Alice**but it has bergamot as one of the notes so if that is included in the citruses you are allergic to sorry :(




**White rabbit** (*Strong black tea and milk with white pepper, ginger, honey and vanilla, spilled over the crisp scent of clean linen*) is also very balanced and nice, qiite ethereal!


**Morocco** (*Arabian spices wind through a blend of warm musk, carnation, red sandalwood and cassia.*) is also a lot of peoples' fav and it is sooo creamy and nice. I have to say I hear people describe it as warm but to me personally it is not warm lol! I wouldn't call it warm *or* cool, it is just very balanced. If you like gentle creamy scents, I would highly recommend this one!




They alao have a new Yule scent **Porcelain Krampus** (*Brown leather and a bundle of switches encased in pale white orris root and rice powder, translucent white musk, Himalayan ambrette seed, and milky vanilla.*) that I heard people describe as very creamy and somewhat ethereal. I haven't tried it yet but I had placed an order with it so it's coming my way! If you want, I can let u know what it smells like to me once I get it."

Additionally, while many game-specific topics are OK, non-notable news unfit for a more general gacha community should instead be shared as a post within the relevant game-specific subreddit. 

Some game content that is disallowed and will be removed includes:

* Character trailers and new banner news (unless part of a collaboration or anniversary event)
* Regular patch notes or content updates (larger version trailers are allowed)
* Most social posts and regular in-game announcements

Let's start with a sloth body-shape and locomotion style. Replace the shaggy moss-like fur with a very short layer of sandy brown to orange hair interspersed with clumps of longer hair and spines that resemble desert scrub grass. We'll leave the sloth claws, but make them larger and more useful for hunting live prey. The face will probably be more canine or feline shaped with the elongated face that is more useful for getting down inside of a body to eat the soft bits.

As for hunting style, let's make them ambush predators. They tend to lie still, half buried in sand or rocky debris, waiting for [prey species] to come close enough to attack. They typically move only a little faster than a real sloth, but are capable of bursts of incredible speed for ten to thirty seconds at a time. 

The weird clicking noises they make are used to coordinate between groups of two or more of the creatures at a distance. A single creature by itself will almost never make any sound. The creatures specifically evolved to communicate in a range that [prey species] has a difficult time hearing.

These creatures have a very slow metabolism due to the relatively low amount of food available in their environment, which explains their usually very slow movement and hunting style. A side effect of this is that despite their apparant mammalian roots, they share a lot of similarities with reptiles, including hibernation during times of dangerous weather or scarce food, and the ability to continue growing for their entire life. The older and larger the creatures get, the less they move and the longer their periods of hibernation. When they do awaken, some of the largest specimens can nearly depopulate an area of suitable food sources before falling back into a torpor state."

>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"" to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".

America leaves Euroasia, Russia-Iran-China divides it between them. America's rich elite carves up the States and turns them in to an oligarchy, just like the Russian model. Give it time, it's coming. People screamed for years about Soros, but think that Musk will not play the very same game for his own ego and personal wealth?
People do not realize, that part of how Putin stayed in power so long, was that he stoked both the Far-Right and the Far-Left. He funded both the old Communists, and the Neo-Nazi's - why? Because when the extreme poles of society are busy screaming at each other, and you then make it know you support it, nobody is really sure what and who are to blame. The people in Washington called it ''Managed Perception'' back in the 90s. Instead people point at each other and scream in impotence, while nothing is organized for changing things."

I think Ranma is more fun when the shipping is open season and there's not clear 'correct choice' which the original anime gave us in spades. Everyone had an episodes or arcs they could point at in support of their girl (except Kodachi, I guess). We also didn't sweat what was filler and what wasn't for the most part-I would the 89 anime was regarded as a distinct and separate work from the manga rather than mere adaptation. This was generally true for lot of anime back when as I recall.

Personally, I think the anime providing more uncertainty about who Ranma belonged with helped to keep the 90s fandom vibrant and alive for as long as it was. I don't think the fan interest around the revival series is going to last nearly as long with it being a straighter manga adaptation, but i'll appreciate it while it lasts."

... We have to assume that some doctor she complained to asked ""is the patient on Flouroquinelones?"" Followed by ""Does the patient have a history of joint or any other inflammatory conditions?"" 

I'm guessing THAT doctor then pointed out the black box warning on Cipro/Levoquin and explained that I was absolutely NOT making up the pain, my tendons were probably RUPTURING and that she better get my meds changed RIGHT AWAY. 

I got no apology - I got no ACTUAL explanation. 

Actually- that horrible bitch of a doctor never even spoke to me again, despite me being there for six more days and her, being in charge of my care...

 She treated me like a lying monster- whileI was in *unbearable pain*

 All because that doctor had no idea the COMMON side effects of Levoquin or Cipro.... And figured i must be lying instead of looking for ANY explanation for my VERY REAL symptoms. 

 I'm SO GLAD i was only on those IV meds for less than a full day- because in the months prior, id been given one or both of those meds - orally  - MANY times, and we'd had no explanation for the ongoing damage they were doing to me, why i was having SUCH severe leg pain, and ongoing damage to my tendons and ligaments-  why I was, over all, getting SO MUCH worse that year. 

It's insane how bad it is dealing with EDS. 

... especially being a woman, when so many doctors treat us like liars and like were exaggerating everything. (Female doctors the worst!)

 I was FINALLY taken seriously and put into pain management where they started me on long acting (ER) AND (immediate) IR pain meds- and thanks to Genetic testing- they know that I'm also a rapid metabolizer, so I'm on HIGH doses because i don't process a huge amount of the meds I'm given. 

If it wasn't for the genetic tests, or the head of pain management who thought my case was ""unique and interesting""- i know SO MANY people with this condition who aren't treated for their pain. 

My long term pain meds have given me my life back. Since then, I've run a Lego club, run a Christmas charity for ten years, even had a second baby - and when SO MANY people across the country where having their meds cut off, or cut down on, SEVERELY- i was so lucky that DNA test was the PROOF my doctors needed to keep me on the dosages that would actually work and actually help- 

The amount of people i know who have EDS-3 and can't get taken seriously AT ALL because we don't know the genre responsible, it's so depressing. The pain from this condition is unreal. Even sleeping is painful A.F. 

Seeing people online just jumping on the fucking bandwagon that they too have EDS makes me so angry. It's SO HARD to get proper care and treatment, and i don't want to even PRETEND to be the arbitraror of who really has a serious condition and who's full of shit... But when i see these people who are on Tiktok talking about EDS, and their FULL FOCUS is on how they can get thier pet ""certified"" as a service dog - and talking about how hard their life is because their family doesn't support them ... Yet they also have no problem doing crafts, typing and being on live streams for hours on end.... 

Like girl ... No. Eds isn't all about wearing zebra print everything, attending conferences with your hot pink crutches, hot pink kafos, with your service dog in his hot pink vest (who only does DPT, of course!) and being covered in hot pink KT tape... Ffs. 

I never wanted EDS to be one of these internet fads, but sadly, type 3, especially, seems to be the focus of a LOT of younger content creators and its.... concerning."

1. I wanted the Model S.  I ended up going with the Model 3 because I absolutely did not like the Yoke and there was no option to have it back then.

2. The last year or so, I get the itch to upgrade.  I have a bad memory, evidently, because every time I start looking and all the cars I want I remember why I didn't pull the trigger before.  I am not buying this car without stalks.  Just now.  

For the naysayers, I did try it. My buddy has a new Model S that I tried.  The shift swiping was driving me nuts.  Maybe the new generation can get behind the stalkless cars because they do not know the latter.  Who knows.  But it is not for me.  I am just one person, but a total of 3 vehicles I ended up not buying because of different design decisions."

I don't have 40 years so I don't have to worry about making 1T lol.  You are missing a detail in my comment.  I ""aim"" for 100%.  Naturally, that's not a regularly achievable result.  It's also tricky to come up with a realistic return when using leverage.  As I said, I'm very happy with 50% and 25% is not exactly the end of the world either.  

I know many will not believe it's doable but just look at my comment history.  I have been advocating trading BN and CCO for a long time both of which have doubled from the bottom over a year.  I don't post all my holdings but I do note interesting stocks occasionally.  You may have seen some bullish comments on Tesla.  You may have seen me comment on liking Disney around $80, ENB under 50 IIRC.  Heck even LUNR is doing well now.  I am on record on staying out of BCE that everyone loves so much.  I think I have a pretty good feel for things to trust my process.  

I'm not looking to become a trillionaire, not even a billionaire, a millionaire yes.  But I don't need a huge amount to retire on.

Does that sound more reasonable?

You do good DD you must be doing well.  If you use leverage it helps a lot.

Here's the thing about this. To amass billions, individuals exploit systemic advantages, leveraging tax loopholes, regulatory gaps, and labor underpayment to maximize profits. Strategies can include minimizing costs by cutting worker benefits, outsourcing, or streamlining infrastructure at the expense of employees. Wealth may also stem from inheritance or using insider knowledge and aggressive tactics to dominate industries. Philanthropy, is frequently a tool for public relations or securing tax advantages. Examples include Elon Musk, whose wealth stems from apartheid-era money and aggressive acquisitions, and Donald Trump, known for stiffing contractors and leveraging inherited wealth. Billionaire success often involves prioritizing profit over ethics, with empathy and fairness taking a backseat to financial gain. In this guys case, insider trading, claim denials, etc.  Notice how Trump, or Musk, or any billionaire, usually inherit their father's traits of scumbaggery to become rich.  Look at trumps kids. 

What happens when you don't have this type of father figure?  Look at musks kids, they seem to be the antithesis of what musk is.  So when i hear that these kids were left ""fatherless"" ?  I don't have sympathy for that.  I grew up with an abusive father and i can honestly say i wish i grew up without one.  Who know's tho, this woman will probably remarry and replace her kids dad with an equal or worse asshole."

Our players are static, absolutely.  I watch City regularly because I'm a Pep fanboy.  I watched a lot of Xavi's Barcelona (very similar to Arteta's system), Alonso's Leverkusen, and now Kompany's Bayern.  All Pep disciples, all possession-focused positional play systems, and let me tell you, every single one of them has/had exponentially more life in the central and half spaces.  More players, more passes, more movement.  I haven't consulted any stats because I genuinely don't even need to, but I'm sure you could find them and discover that they agree with me.  Arteta's ability to possess the ball between the lines in the center is so comically far off every single one of his peers I can only hope Santa doesn't send me a bucket of coal for even suggesting the comparison.  

>I've watched every single Arsenal match this season and seen nothing wrong with the way we play.

Then you don't know ball, like at all.  We are a possession team that can only create via wing play, and even then only on our right side, and even then only on account of the individual brilliance of two specific players.  City, for their part, generally score almost as many goals even when KDB is missing, because their system itself is so productive from all areas of the pitch that they literally do not require any moments of individual brilliance to rack up 4-5 goals every game, recent collapse excluded.  

>So imo you're being too much by putting all the blame on Arteta. Saying the players who, at the end of the day, are the ones who play on the pitch aren't at fault for anything too is crazy.

If the players looked incapable of executing simple tasks, then I would blame the players.  But that's not what's happening.  On the whole, the technical and intellectual level of our players is very obviously among the best in the world.  The problem, as is obvious to anyone who plays/played this sport, is that despite their obvious inherent qualities, our players do not take risks, ever.  Countless chance-creating opportunities are left unplucked so that we can pass sideways to the Odegaard/Saka complex and beg that they make wine from water.  Compared to other teams, our players have clearly been coached out of being able to play fluid, dynamic, opportunistic football.  Or, if you like, you can compare our own players to their former selves at other clubs.  Did you know that White, for example, is actually one of the most gifted ball carrying defenders in the world?  I bet you didn't, because if you didn't watch him at Brighton, you'd assume he wasn't capable of anything other than short, simple passes to or away from Saka, because that's all that Arteta allows.  

My advice to you is this: watch Madrid play for a few weeks.  Notice how the general quality of their first touch and passing isn't nearly as sharp as ours, and how, despite that, their players back themselves to actually make things happen instead of passing the ball sideways all the time.  Notice how they create far more chances than we do.  Notice how they score more goals and are generally more successful despite having less control, and ask yourself if Arteta will ever be able to compete with a philosophy that is not only antithetical to everything the best team in the world is doing, but also one that has failed to achieve anything thus far.  

ESR was absolutely good enough, by the way.  He remains a brilliant player.  Arteta sold him because he's a dynamic central ball carrier, and he hates those.  Nwaneri will be sold for the same reason in a few seasons, he's the exact same profile and ESR was every bit as talented."

Guys, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I ended up moving to Canada very spontaneously, and as a result, all my belongings — and my cat — stayed back in my home country. I had been living there without my parents for 8 years. I managed to arrange for my cat to be transported remotely to my mom in Moscow, and from there, she was supposed to bring him to me in Canada.

Before her flight to Canada, she was also planning to move to a new city. The idea was that 6 days after her move, she would fly to Canada with my cat. But 48 hours before her move, she decided she wouldn’t risk taking the cat with her because he doesn’t handle travel well.

We had a conversation at 9 a.m. where she told me she wouldn’t be bringing him. I was upset, cried, and felt really emotional about it. After that, I didn’t hear from her — no messages, no calls.

The next day, I opened social media and saw a post on her page offering to give my cat away to a good home. I had no idea she was going to do this, and she definitely didn’t ask me for permission.

Now she is saying to psychologist that she tried to reach me and ask what she supposed to do with the cat, but I never answered to her. Which is not true and I got screenshots of all our messages and calls history. 

There have been a few other situations where I feel like my personal boundaries were violated and I was treated like a child. (For context, I’m 23, I moved to another country alone at 15, and I’ve been fully financially independent since I turned 18.)

We’re now seeing a psychologist together to work through these issues, but I’d still love to hear your perspective. Do you think she had the right to make that post about my cat?
Or it’s me overreacting?

UPDATE.
Guys, my cat is 4 years old now and he is with my mom only for last 9 months. Unfortunately I never planned this moving to Canada and never was prepared financially. Somebody who send me here told me that I could get him in 2 months, but of course it’s never happened, because tickets are very expensive. Right now I’m trying my best to come there and take him back to me."

1. AP and FSD utilizes the built in navigation. Won't work through Carplay maps
2. Battery conditioning is also built into the navigation. I guess they could make it a manual setting like you can do with the s3xy buttons but with other manufacturers, if you use Carplay navigation, it doesn't auto precondition the battery or tell you charge remaining at destination.
3. Spotify is a Tesla app and starting today I can use it without a subscription, yay!
4. My phone battery is preserved, Carplay uses a lot of battery even plugged in.
5. Wireless Carplay loses connection every once I awhile. Wired Carplay is annoying, 1st world problem, obviously. 

>With google maps, it was easy to pick a destination on my phone and have it directly sync to carplay. 

You can already do this. Just share to the Tesla app and navigation is set. You can do this before you get into the car.

It starts with the truly eye watering statistics of Americans betting $150 billion this year, up from $7 billion in 2018, along with $80 billion in online casino gaming. 

It goes on to say this is because of the ease of doing this from an app, while two paragraphs later saying sports betting is actually communal and not just a sad thing in the shadows. 

If I was confident congress would do anything to benefit people ever again, I would say the congressional hearings on this would make waves, but we just elected a casino owning felon again so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯."

Cas concret:

Mokhtar le Marocain en France depuis 10 ans rencontre Anna la Russe en France depuis 5 ans. Ils ont un enfant né à Paris.
5 ans après la naissance, la famille décide d'aller vivre aux USA.

Tu veux attribuer quelle nationalité à l'enfant?

- Française? Pour n'avoir vécu que 5 ans en France dans sa petite enfance
- Russe? Marocaine? Son éducation a été façonnée par ces 2 cultures.
- Américaine? étant arrivé jeune et selon le temps qu'il y restera, il aura sûrement tout d'un américain


La plurinationalité lui permet de tisser des liens avec ses 4 univers. Dans le futur, cet enfant peut se sentir plus proche d'une culture et vouloir aller vivre dans le pays associé. Lui retirer ce droit c'est l'amputer d'une partie de lui même.

Sur ce côté, étant donné le nombre de binationaux dans la sphère politique, la plurinationalité n'est pas prête d'être abrogée en France."

The executor of the auction wrote the judge back explaining it was all bullshit. The judge just put a hold on it to get to the bottom of the claims and (eventually) lay the smack down on Jones' lawyers for lying to the judge.

I was packing all my things up last night in time for pest control and saw dozens all over my electronics in a bedroom drawer, it was horrific. I had to bag the electronics and wires around it and now I’m dreading ever opening that bag. Part of me never wants to see all my belongings ever again. I’m not sure I can move the fixed wardrobes, really wish I could. I’ll keep an eye on my kitchen cabinets and keep cleaning/spraying there! I’m not even sure all the mould is gone as I never even knew where it was in the first place. Perhaps it’s all behind the fixed wardrobes since it is super moist in the wood. 

Gosh I’m so sorry to hear, it’s not easy at all (completely relate on the itchy feeling and being sick). I defo refuse to shower ever now too, not even embarrassed to say it. The anxiety and ptsd from it all is gonna be hard to get rid of! I don’t blame you for checking but I’m so glad you’re for the most part at ease now and I am so sorry cause I don’t think anyone in the world deserves to go through that shit. I pray you NEVER see one again!!! The fact they’re so resistant to everything is so unfair. Honestly makes you feel like your life is over, I’m feeling so low and sad too. 

Don’t worry, I saw all the Reddit posts too and that’s the part that hit hardest I guess. That what if they’re never truly gone or I move away and they follow me? Or I spread them to all my family? Are they gonna be in my electronics forever? My mind can’t help wondering all these things. I want to cry at the thought of even unpacking the bin bags with all my things. I’m so so scared. 

I don’t know how people can keep trying for two years but massive respect to them. At that point, think I’d burn everything. I’m gonna try my absolute best but I do wonder how long I can keep going with this or how I’m going to ever live comfortably again and I’m really grateful you’re just straight up honest. The fucking fear that is set in me though, I feel so done and fed up and know you feel exactly the same. The fact there’s not just one simple fix, how has this not been created yet. I’d rather have the plague at this point. Your partner has a good point - maybe they just keep dying out and resurrecting in a cycle for other people but in minuscule amounts. Who knows.

As stated above, I’m searching for LITERATE and DETAILED (meaning 1-2 paragraphs) sub/powerbottom partners for a longterm futa x futa roleplay (with some slow burn elements) set in the Super Mario universe between Rosalina and Peach/Daisy. I will be playing Rosalina, you pick which character you’d like to play :).

My kinks are: Anal, powerbottoms, cock/ball/ass worship, handsfree cumshots, facials, backshots, frotting, tit fucking, ball fucking, spanking, cock slapping, dirty talk, degradation, voyeurism, blowjobs, ass eating/rimjobs, size difference, noncon, and cum swallowing.

My limits are: Anything relating to snuff, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, extreme violence, excessive swearing, vore, age play,  godmodding, feet, musk, bodily fluids other than cum and public hair.

I have an idea for a plot/story, please feel free to make any changes to it if you feel any could be made!

The plot is as follows:

Rosalina has been away from the mushroom kingdom for a little while, and misses her friends dearly, and sends out a text asking if they want to catch up sometime, to which Daisy/Peach invites them over for a multi-day slumber party! Rosalina, being lonely and sexually repressed due to her isolation on the comet observatory, gladly accepts the invitation, and when they meet up, Rosa being Rosa acts all awkward and shy while our characters hang out, and slowly but surely the tension builds up (at least to Rosa), which lead to some naughty things happening until its full on, degrading sex.

Again, please suggest any changes if you’d like to see some, I want this to be fun for the both of us :3. We’ll discuss the more specific details once we’re in DMs!

In your opener, please include an introduction that includes your roleplay experience, the character you wish to play as, your kinks and limits, as well as a small reason to why you picked the character you did. Please add a burger emoji so I know you read ALL of this. Low effort openers will be ignored.

I hope to see you in DMs! :3"

We don't know what we are capable of until we are faced with it. Looking back, if I was told I would go through this horrendous time I wouldn't have believed I could have done it either. Most days I'm shocked that we got through it together. When you're going through it you just live day by day and the big picture just sort of happens.  I just knew that losing my daughter would have been my biggest fear. If I could think of the one thing that would destroy me more than death itself it was that. 


I agree with you that open adoption should be more commonplace! I've been saying this for many years. I think we are getting to a point as a society where we will see a lot more of it.  I feel like the more people who are involved and love a child the better off the child is.  I also believe it would be more therapeutic for parents especially those in tragic situations like your birth mother to have some sort of connection with their children. She was so young! Even if she wasn't capable of raising you, it may have been good for both of you to see one another periodically, or at least a few times when you reached a certain age for closure. 


One thing I have definitely learned and try to remind myself of is the fact that there are so few right or wrong, black or white situations. Most of the time we as people are just doing the best we can with the choices we have in front of us.  The day I realized this was the day I think I truly became an adult.  


Before having kids and in my teenage years I thought it would be so easy, and that the world would give me such clear choices with obvious answers. But that's rarely if ever the case, and many times it's the lesser of two evils, or a simple solution to get someone by turns into a lifelong habit. 


I'm sorry you still had to experience a household with addiction! It isn't an easy life, and it impacts the family way more than I could ever explain. My father became an alcoholic when I was around 4.  He still struggles with it to this day, and it has caused me a lifetime of problems.  I try to  focus on the positive, and when I can't I try and find the lesson the universe is trying to teach me.  It has helped me through the darkest times of my life. When I think I can't handle it anymore I stop and think: what is this supposed to teach me? 


Your adoptive father is very lucky to have you! Addiction really does a number on the body, and if you are lucky enough to make it to older age it tends to come with a myriad of health problems.   I am happy that he did choose to get sober so you can still have time with him to repair any damage that was done during the active addiction years. I hope you guys have a blessed holiday! And thank you for listening to all of my ramblings"

The estate declined to purchase them but issued a letter stating it does not claim ownership. However, the estate clarified that any buyer would not hold the copyright to the recordings or compositions, prohibiting public release without proper authorization.

So the songs themselves (the lyrics and melodies) aren't the issue, that copyright is handled through publishing companies, e.g. ASCAP, BMI. The recordings' copyright may belong to Bryan Loren. It really depends on what their arrangement was, if it was work for hire, or what their contracts said. Since Loren is still alive, they'd have to go through him (potentially) and obviously not his estate."

My understanding is that expat communitites exist for a variety of reasons but often because when settling into a new country your need for friendship and connections is out of phase with large chunks of the population, but very much in phase with other recent arrivals to the country.

My personal experience moving to a different country to live and work, was that I made lots of connections with the locals through work, but made some lifelong friends with others who had just moved to the country (These were not just Aussies, but people from lots of other nations with the key difference that they also had needs to make new friends)."

70 years of mostly focusing on LEO architecture. We had plans for mars back when Von Braun was still leading the program. SpaceX is building off of that 70 years by the way. 


>And you think it would take less than a quarter of that to tackle something orders of magnitude more difficult


SpaceX announced the mars focus 13 years ago(musk has been mars focused for at least 23 years).  12 years ago they announced the Mars Colonial Transporter which became the Interplanetary Transport System in 2016 then the Big Falcon Rocket in 2017 where they had already started testing raptor engines which became the starship. So for 13 years SpaceX has been developing a vehicle for Mars, we know from employee interviews that mars projects are constantly being worked on and  we know SpaceX has 5 years of crewed space mission experience.

Your EV6 is an 800V architecture. The EV6 uses its rear motor inverters to boost the voltage, and is limited to about 100-120kW in theory.

That’s after Tesla fixed it being only 42kW because the Supercharger throttled due to detecting an inductive load load or something like that

That's a problem, obviously, especially when it isn't always easy to find a new job.

I disagree on two points, though.

First, when you say that these bands had only one option, switching careers, instead of two? Maybe eventually, but I'm gonna stick with the Warrant analogy here: if the guys in that band had fallen on such hard times that making music just didn't pay the bills any more and they all needed to look into getting mundane, 9-5 jobs, then they wouldn't have been able to make a fourth album, let alone a fifth, right? So it seems like there was some gas in the tank still, even if it was getting close to running on fumes.

Second, when you say that hair metal is dead right now, I don't believe that's the case. Somebody made a comparison on here between how everybody turned on disco and how everybody turned on hair metal about ten years later. So disco died, and nobody missed it at all...for a while. But then, after however many years, old disco songs started to get played here and there once again. A new generation of listeners who never had to hear ""Stayin' Alive"" 1200 times thought that it was a good song. That ""Hot Stuff"" was a good song. That ""Celebration"" was a good song (or maybe they played GTA San Andreas and heard ""Hollywood Swinging"" in that game).

Disco hadn't bounced back to its previous level of popularity, but the days of everybody saying ""Ugh, disco! Who put THAT on? Turn it OFF!"" were a thing of the past.

The same is true of hair metal, I believe. People today might say ""I don't really like it, not my thing,"" but they're just as likely to say ""Yeah, Tesla made some really good songs, I like 'em."" (Tesla having ""Cumin' Atcha Live"" featured in GTA Vice City didn't hurt.) I did see the recent post about the guys in that band having financial difficulties, but put it this way: at least people are *hearing* them today more than they probably did in the '90s, right? And while there might still be some people who say ""Tesla sucks, they're hair metal and hair metal sucks!"", my guess is that being able to stream albums which you used to have to buy or borrow from a friend who bought it has affected everybody to varying degrees. Like, I thought that the guys in Metallica were being very unreasonable years ago when Napster came along and they made a big stink about it, but I guess maybe they realized what it would mean for everybody's earnings. I do know that even artists who get streamed a lot on Spotify do not receive very much money at all, and if you're an artist who only gets streamed now and then, or barely at all...yeah, it's tough."

Starmer has been very vocal about his view of government as a public service. Stay out of identity politics, don’t meddle in people’s lives, just provide infrastructure and regulation for people to do their thing. You can argue the toss on how well Starmer actually embodies those principles, but the fact remains that this is the message that is being projected.

Musk and the right wing values he’s attached himself to, cannot tolerate this. His brand of wealthy exceptionalism doesn’t flourish in environments where the government’s expressed goal is nothing more than providing services to the average person.

I suspect that Musk worries that Starmer’s project might succeed and set an example to other countries. Neither of these I think are realistic; if Starmer has any success it’ll be humble and nuanced, and not the kind of slam-dunk that causes other countries to take notice.

But I don’t think this changes Musk’s desire to nip it in the bud right now. He has the means and the platform (literally) to continue projecting his rhetoric, and will do so doggedly.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Musk throughout this process it’s that he can’t possibly be the “brilliant mind” who guided PayPal and Tesla to success. Because recent events have shown that he has a profound lack of imagination; why else would a man with seemingly endless resources spend his days literally bickering with people on Twitter like an edgy teen?"

Just because the Democrats are to the left of the GOP does not make them left wing. I don’t remember Democrats calling themselves “left-wing”, even if they did does not make the democrats leftist by any extent. 

You claim that the opposition, the GOP calls them “leftists” buts that’s assuming that they are credible as Republicans would literally call their opponents or anyone even moderates such as Obama or Clinton “leftists” or “communists”.   


The News calling them “leftists” is simply journalistic malpractice, it does not make them left-wing and social media is so broad to gauge whether the democrats are left-leaning, what do you mean by this? Do you think Elon Musk who owns Twitter calls the Democrats “radical leftists”, so that therefore they must be left-wing?.

Leftism is not liberalism, leftists are those who are anticapitalist (socialist to anarchist). Social Democratic supporters are centre-left at best. The Democrats don’t support any form of worker control or ownership, not in favour of any decommodification of any industry, don’t even support lukewarm democracy or Medicare for All. In fact the democratic donor base is a antagonistic to social democratic policies being implemented otherwise the establishment democrats would not have been antagonistic to Bernie in 2016 and 2020.

Simply because you think the Democrats are left-wing does not make it true, and I am really annoyed by right-wingers who misuse the word “leftism” and “socialism” to literally call whatever the Dems do socialism for decades and then liberals appropriating the label “leftists“ without bothering to learn about the ”left vs right“ politics and the ideas of leftism itself."

AOC has always been active and highly effective in the social media space, connecting personally not only with her district's constituents but the Democrat party as a whole.

Marriage does not automatically mean you become the kids parent - as evidenced and recognized by the fact that stepparents have zero legal rights.
And I do mean zero, because if mom and dad were to die tomorrow, stepmom wouldn't even be considered the default guardian.


In any case, the actual parents should do the utmost to continue actually being a full time parent. Being married to a stepparent should not mean you can or should expect the stepparent to take on the roles you'd expect an actual parent to take on.

They absolutely make a difference in the outcome and strength of a spell, ritual or working, but they're rarely the defining factor. I would work out what the essentials are for what you're trying to do, whether it's working with particular lunar deities or looking for different spell results. It's great you take notes on your results. Treat the factors above as if they all add energy or momentum to your spellwork rather than necessarily being the determining component, and try reevaluating the bare bones construction of the spellwork you're doing first (if it does not work at all).

That said though, I pretty much do all of my magic during a waxing moon nowadays, while trying to at least watch the planetary hour if not the day and hour."

And do you remember when Elon turned it off to interfere with a Ukranian attack against Russia? It's not about ""taking control"" of private infrastructure in some absolute sense, but rather ensuring that critical infrastructure - especially when it has significant national security or humanitarian implications - functions in alignment with public and strategic interests. Governments routinely regulate private industries for the greater good (e.g., telecommunications, utilities). When a private company operates on a scale that influences global security, it’s reasonable to expect oversight or agreements to ensure responsible usage. Starlink wouldn’t even exist without NASA, DoD contracts, and other public funds that helped SpaceX get off the ground. The ""built and maintained with private capital"" narrative is disinformation.

>

Credit where credit is due: Tesla did help EVs go mainstream. But people are capable of appreciating Tesla’s role in advancing EVs *while* criticizing Musk's actions or decisions. Being ""pro EV"" doesn’t require blind loyalty to Musk - especially when other automakers are now catching up and pushing boundaries in different ways. Plus, EV adoption has grown not just because of Tesla, but thanks to government incentives, improved battery tech, and broader public demand for sustainability. Tesla didn’t do it alone, and Musk doesn’t get a free pass for everything just because he helped popularize EVs."

Sure, if the value of the asset did not grow more than $1 in 10 years.  And that's fair and reasonable. 

But that's random hypothetical of investment assets that never change value is not what we're discussing nor is it remotely the only possible outcome. In the real world, Elon Musk's stock portfolio has grown, so taxing the gains at 100% would prevent him from realizing any value. Literally the point of investment assets is that you'd intend to make money off of their growth.

I'm not sure what point you're even trying to make at this point. Like yes, if a person didn't make any additional money, they wouldn't owe additional taxes. That's not some crazy loophole you've exposed; that's just called not making money."

Tesla is not at the forefront of any sort of autonomous driving tech, so guess again there.

Added the Costco discount with no issues and were happy to honor the 0% interest. They took off the bs dealer add ONS when I asked the first time. Other than how long paperwork takes, it was an easy process. 

Compare with my experience at Ford looking at a Mach E. I specifically asked them about a $5k advertised on their website along with the 0% interest and they told me they couldn't do it, so I walked. When I got their follow up call (where they said they'd now offer the $5k discount), I told them exactly why I didn't buy from them. Had they honored the deal from the start, I might be a Mach e owner instead of an equinox EV owner.

Oliver Alexander on X: The Ursa Major was heading to Vladivostok 
and not en route to aid in the evacuation of Tartus. 
Given cargo it carried, this is, in fact, even worse for Russia 
than if it had been heading to Tartus."" 

The Ursa was carrying two Liebherr 420 mobile cranes for the harbor in Vladivostok.

That is heavily backed up due to a lack of cranes and two 45-ton hatches 
for the construction of the new Project 10510 nuclear powered icebreaker.
 
You can see both of the the cranes, as well as grab buckets for bulk handling 
at the harbor in Vladivostok at the front of the vessel. 

The loss of these cranes will severely hurt loading/unloading times in Vladivostok. 
 
In the same image, you can see the two 45-ton hatches at the rear of the vessel covered in a blue tarp. 
These are the two hatches designed to cover the nuclear reactor on Project 10510. 

They can be seen directly in front of the smokestack on the mode. 
 
The loss of these two hatches will delay construction of the Project 10510 significantly."" 
.
Remark from my side: 

The new submarine ""Ursa Major"" belongs to a company with the name 
«Оборонлогистика»/Oboronlogistika 
Oboron ... armor ... yes, the company is part of the Russian war ministry: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oboronlogistics 
 
There is said to have been an explosion in the engine room. 
I have absolutely no idea which additional cargo could have caused an explosion. /s

Oliver Alexander points to the listed destination of Validvostok.

H I Sutton notes this but believes that was a subterfuge, the REAL destination was someplace in Libya, and the cranes were intended to improve port facilities so Russia could replace the lost Syrian port. 

It may well be the cranes German made were initially intended for someplace else or even valdivostok, but were now being rerouted to Libya. 

No matter who is right, this is a severe blow to Russia’s global force projection. It is unlikely that those cranes can be replaced, and it would take years even if a supplier could be found. 

It also raises the question of what happened to the ship. An onboard explosion in the engine room is highly unlikely. Diesel just dies not explode. Either something explosive was there, stowed or planted. OR was it a shore based attack, like a maritime drone? Seems unlikely, but Ukraine was aiding and training HTS. HTS hates Russia. Could the HTS have connections in Algeria that could construct and launch a maritime drone? 

Bottom line, sucks to be Russia right now.

https://x.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1871364800451944943

The incompetence of the rusty Russian navy truly has no bounds.

Spanish media reporting that the Ursa Major has sunk after an explosion in the engine room earlier today, which caused a list. 

14 out of 16 crew members were rescued with 2 still missing.

When someone who's never even wearing pants walks up to you and screams in your face about your fly being down, they aren't doing assuming you won't point out the hypocrisy.  No they are counting on it.

Because the hypocrisy is the point.  It's a flex.  This isn't Musk being a hypocrite.  It's something much worse.  It's Musk being an authoritarian.  He's showing that he can do stuff he's openly telling other people they can't do and daring us to do something about it.

""I use this because I always have"" isn't really a great reason on its own.

""I think combat should have wacky, funny comedy moments"" is... well, it's a choice for how you want your games to run. But unless your opinion is ""high level martial characters that make lots of attacks should be the butt of the joke waaaaaaaaaay more than anyone else"", that's also not a good reason.

>I have never had a problem more than annoyance at a table...  I have had to spend more than my fair share of gold to fix my weapon

So, having less treasure than everyone else, just because you used your class features and were punished for it, doesn't constitute a problem, even though you called it out earlier? 

>as for the effects on spellcasters any spells where they have to roll to hit they would just auto hit themselves 

Yeah, see, the whole ""hitting yourself with your own weapon/spell that you've trained with for years"" is just utter nonsense. How would a Warlock even hit themselves with their own Eldrich Blast, and why would a 20th level Warlock be **more** likely to hit themselves than a 1st level one? 

>I have never had a problem more than annoyance at a table

This is a game, and it's meant to be fun for everyone. Maybe annoying things that make your heroic, epic characters look and act like spastic idiots doesn't belong?"

Some might have wanted to dress in their clothes before venturing to the top decks, others would have wanted to gather their belongings to take with them. In moments of disasters, people might not be thinking clearly and might not just flee for their lives.

That is, the copyright holder imposes a ban on the distribution of any information. In other words, piracy is possible only when there is a market for the appropriation of intangible assets. In North Korea, there is no such appropriation, due to a different type of society than capitalism, all intangible assets, such as music, do not belong to a specific person or organization, but to the entire North Korean society. And as far as I understand, neither the Korean state nor any other representative of the copyright holder has imposed any ban on the distribution, copying or modification of their intellectual property. Therefore, this is not piracy. And not a citizen of North Korea, from a legal point of view, using music, the one who uses it with permission. But there is another nuance here, that the legal system of intellectual property applies exclusively within a specific state. (With rare exceptions, if countries have signed treaties on mutual recognition of courts) For example, if you write the greatest symphony in the world, no one in your country can copy it without your permission. But I, in another country, can. And the only thing stopping me from doing so is that you came to my country and registered the symphony as yours. Or I could register the invention in my home country faster than you can get there, and I'll be the next Marconi. You might want to see if some North Korean music lover has already registered it as his. Then, to avoid being a pirate, you'd have to buy the music from him."

You probably won't find a point in most parts of quantum mechanics, rocket science, fundamental science, applied science, literature, arts, history, etc., and it's perfectly fine; everything is not for everyone, and you don't need to do or follow everything. I mean many people didn't find a point in the Vedas and their 'pointless rituals,' but Vivekananda, Shri Ramakrishna, Adi Shankaracharaya, Ramprasad, Bamakhypa, and countless other Rishis and monks for thousands of years found a point in it and countless others still find and will find a point in it. Tesla, J.C. Bose, Schrodinger, etc., found a point in Vedanta. Our interests and thought process are biased towards our circumstances; our circumstances, company and exposure influence our thought process, and our thought process, perception, and biases have an influence on our interests, likes, and dislikes. Perception can be changed with a perfect company or with life experiences; you might become extremely interested in scientific research if you spend enough time in a lab with a good scientist, or probably your interest could grow in spirituality if you spend enough time with a good monk. So, if you are feeling not to follow any custom, it's perfectly fine for you and for that tradition. As you will live your life, that tradition will continue irrespective of your perception about that tradition as long as there are people who find a point in that tradition."

because eastern anatolia, northern syria and iraq, do not belong to kurds exclusively. kurds even immigrated to these areas after turks, because of religious reasons. ottomans were a sunni state (think it like catholics) and they relocated kurds from iran to eastern anatolia because these kurds were sunni too, but iran is shia (think it like protestants). it happened in 1400s. okay accept kurds to be locals, since they lived here for centuries, but still they werent the only ethnicity in the region. they lived as autonomus tribes ruled by tribal chiefs and shared the region with turkmen tribes, assyrians, arabs and armenians. what entitles them as the sole owners of eastern anatolia?? because anglos said so, because anglos want to use them as the puppet population to take control of our lands, this is the case pretty much

i dont understand why all of these unitarian republics of europe who are so obsessed with word integration, cant stand kurds becoming integrated to turkey? kurds are opressed under tribal chefdoms stuck in stonages mentally. europeans are obessed with european ideals and values too, okay turkey was founded on these ideals too and since we want to embrace these ideals we want everyone to embrace them regardless of their region but rural regions and majority kurds are opressed with backwards ideas. most progresive people here dont care with people of different regions speaking their regional accents or languages, as long as they are integrated to the values of freedom and human rights and dont promote. europeans claiming integration to their values is opression, then you also opress your conservatives"

1st John 4 says that God is love, that love comes from God, that all who love know God, that if they abide in love, they abide in God, and God abides in them.

Romans 13:8-10 says that every commandment is summed up in the command to love your neighbor as yourself.  That love is what keeps the law.  And that Love causes no harm to your neighbor.

Galatians 3:19-26 tells us that the law was given to be a guardian until Christ came, but now that Jesus is here, we no longer have any need of a guardian.

Galatians 5:4 tells us that if we try and be justified by the law, we cut ourselves off from Christ and fall from grace.

Galatians 5:14 reiterates that every commandment is summed up in the command to love your neighbor as yourself.

Matthew 22:37-40 has Jesus himself saying that greatest commandments are to love God and to love your neighbor, and that these are the foundation that every other law is built upon.  The conclusion is that if you cannot justify a command via love, it is not a command from God.

Jesus told us the standard by which we will be judged on the day of judgement.  Matthew 25.  And it is not by how well we adhere to some rigid code of conduct.  Rather, it is by how we feed the hungry, clothe the naked, house the homeless, and take care of the sick.  James said the essence of true religion is to take care of the orphans and widows in their distress.

Jesus also told us how to recognize false teachers.  He said we would know them by their fruits.

When you tell someone that God made them biologically unworthy of romantic love or lifelong companionshiop, because of a fact of their biology that they did not choose and are incapable of changing, you are telling them that God made them less than human.

When you tell someone that they must live a life bereft of the fullness of the expression of love that God intended humanity experience, lest they commit abominations before God, and the reason for their love being an abomination is their biology, something that God apparently arbitrarily assigned to them, you are telling them that God made them less than human.

The fruits of this message are the depression, abuse (physical, emotional, sexual), kidnapping, brainwashing/torture, homelessness, forced prostitution, self-harm, and suicide of some of societies most vulnerable children.  It is a message that consistently results in broken homes, broken people, and drives people away from God.

The fruits are misery, death, and lost souls.  It is not a message that any God of love would give."

There's the herpesviridae family of viruses, consisting of viruses like Epstein-Barr virus and HSV1 & 2. They are extremely effective at evading the immune system and establishing a lifelong infection, much like HIV. Whilst neither HSV1 & 2 are likely to do much damage (unless you're immunocompromised or you're unlucky enough to develop herpes simplex encephalitis), the Epstein-Barr virus can be really nasty and is associated with the development of a wide variety of diseases, including lymphomas and even multiple sclerosis. The herpesviridae viruses are also ridiculously widespread, with over 90% of the population of the US showing evidence of previous infection.

Bill Clinton IS a serial sexual predator back to his time as Arkansas governor. Let's use the power/privilege argument the left loves to use about such things. By that metric Bill Clinton with the intern was very the very definition of sexual abuse by that standard. 

Bill Clinton was being sued for sexual harassment by Paula Jones (civil suit), and he committed perjury and was disbarred for committing and fined for committing perjury, which is a felony

While I think it was not worthy of impeachment, committing a felony while in office definitely could be an impeachable offence. 

In addition, Hilary Clinton slut shamed his multiple victims. The CNN article does not exonerate Hilary either, they just say she did not quite ""viciously attack"" the victims.

It doesn’t always happen quickly, and it won’t always be the first therapist you work with who helps you. Half of what makes therapy helpful, in my opinion, is the work we do on ourselves while we’re in therapy and for this having a supportive network is incredibly helpful. 

When you’re stuck in bed staring at the wall, if there’s someone who can help you get unstuck, it makes all the difference.

Medication can help. Again, the first one you try is not always the right choice and it can be a bit of a roller coaster. But it can make a tremendous difference, and again it’s helpful if there are people who support you around. If you’ve got decent insurance, start with the Genesight site test that can help rule out the mental health meds that your body won’t process correctly.

I teach people complicated things for a living. It’s my lifelong opinion that no one is truly stupid, except for that small proportion of people who are intellectually disabled. And even they often have some amazing strengths. What’s missing in a lot of people’s lives is that they’re never taught how to think, or given the confidence to believe that it’s even worth their time. IQ is one measure of thinking speed and puzzle solving ability, and it’s great when people score high on that, but you can be very bright in other ways. The IQ test is a bit of a misnomer.

The trick to finding your intelligence is to lean into the things that call to you and about which you are enthusiastic. If the people in your life think that you’re stupid, or God forbid your parents reinforce that idea, look for people who can love you for who you are and distance yourself from the people who harm you by trying to make you less-than.

I realize that’s very tricky when you’re depressed. I’ve seen people get help from group therapy. It can feel real uncomfortable while you’re in it, but you can also make connections that are right for that moment in time. They don’t have to be long lasting connections, but they can help you take the next step. 

Are you in the US, and are you still in primary or secondary school? There could be resources available if you’re still school aged. I know nothing about resources once you’ve graduated from HS other than what you’d find searching for therapists on-line and paying out of pocket/insurance. Some insurance companies have good mental health benefits, so don’t assume that yours does not, and if you’re still on your parent’s insurance there’s a chance.

Hold onto that thread and I hope you find your peace of mind and engagement. There really is a light in each of us, and once you find yours, your life will improve."

I just said ""No one’s saying it’s on the level of being an owner."" Who are you arguing with?

> The point is that any rich fk could have bought those seats

But could any rich fk have bought those seats? They haven't even been put up for sale and the deal is already in place to sell all of them for an incredibly high amount (three times what Madrid got for theirs). This seems like something that was worked out specifically with the Qataris as a way to get money into the club. 

> What influence are you talking about?

You don't think owning all the VIP seats at the Camp Nou comes with influence? If you're any public figure, and you want the best seats to see Barcelona, you better cozy up with the Qataris. They can go meet with a politician and hand them luxury seats to Saturday's game, seats that nobody else can get. They could just fill the luxury level with Qataris at every match, showing themselves off as the rich benefactors of the club. Heck, they could hand VIP tickets out on Las Ramblas, making the people love them. There's a lot you can do when you own all the hottest tickets in town. Again, **it's not on the level of being an owner**, but it's that same model of buying influence through sport."

>Hard to like a season that makes little to no sense. 

It makes perfect sense, IMO.

>The snake plotline went nowhere,

It's true that it would have been nice to have more scenes with Rokume/Six Eyes, but her main role is just to set Legoshi on the path of investigating and uncovering the culprit of Tem's devouring. 

Since it's winter when Legoshi confronts Riz (and fights him on New Years)
and since Rokume/Six Eyes is a  rattlesnake, she could have been hibernating for all we know (that's what I'd like to think at least, lol). It kinda makes sense though. 


> Haru was barely present, 


I wish Haru was more present as well, but that's not the focus of the arc (and it's a direct plot point that Legoshi was acting odd and standoffish towards her during his training and hunt for Tem's killer, which is something Haru brings up). 


Season 1 focused largely on trying to understand the herbivores' struggles, through Legoshi & Haru's point of view. 


Season 2 largely focuses on trying to understand carnivores' struggles, through Legoshi & Riz's point of view.


>Legoshi's non-carnivore approach was useless in the end. 


Not true. As other have explained:


 In season 1, Legoshi was trying not to be a carnivore and not accept who he is (and gradually learns to accept aspect of that side of himself and how he can use his strength to protect others). In season 2, his arc of self acceptance continues and culminates with Legoshi finally accepting all of himself as a carnivore by eating meat (**while still being able to maintain control and not rob a herbivore of their life**). Legoshi's character revolved around his self-loathing as a carnivore so the natural endgame for his character is self-acceptance (as a carnivore), **while still keeping to his ideals which recognize the preciousness and respect for all lives**.


 To answer a few common questions: 


Why didn’t Legoshi call the police? There's two big reasons why Legoshi didn’t call the police. First, there’s a specific scene in season two with Legoshi & Gohin where a carnivore comes to the Gohin’s office and Gohin gives her a prescription. Gohin says she had eaten two ferrets, but he did not turn her into the police, because he didn’t believe punishment would help her, and in the Beastars universe being a Predation Offender is life-ruining. Gohin’s main job is essentially kidnapping carnivores who had committed murder or were about to and treating them, not turning them in. He is a vigilante doctor, and his job is not exactly legal. If Legoshi won, he would have brought Riz to Gohin, had Pina not called the police. That’s why Legoshi had been training to capture carnivores drunk on meat in alleyways through out the season. Riz also represents what Legoshi could have easily become. He feels it would be hypocritical to have the law deal with Riz when he himself nearly gave into those same instincts as well. 


And second, Legoshi wanted to confront Riz about their ideals, as the primary theme of this season is their clash of ideals. Riz was a character who was lonely, pumped up on government issued suppressing drugs, and desperately wanted a herbivore to understand him. In order to cope with brutally murdering the only herbivore who reached out and tried to understand him, Riz deluded himself into believing the greatest act of friendship between a carnivore/herbivore was a herbivore understanding the carnal nature of a carnivore, and allowing Riz to eat him. He sugarcoated his memories of Tem as if Tem wanted to be eaten as a sign of their friendship. This is why Louis apologizes to Riz for not realizing how lonely he was. Not to take blame off of Riz, but Louis implies that perhaps if someone had reached out to Riz (& ultimately, if herbivore and carnivore societies could try to reach out and understand each other instead of segregate) this tragedy might have been avoided. 


Why did Legoshi eat Louis’ leg? Why did Riz stop fighting? Legoshi & Louis spent the entire series denying their roles as carnivore & herbivore. When they finally accepted themselves, Legoshi proved Riz's ideals wrong by showing him what true friendship was. Louis, a herbivore willing to allow a carnivore to eat a part of him to save him as a sign of his trust and friendship. And Legoshi, a carnivore who was so resolute in never eating flesh, giving into his nature to uphold his beliefs. This is why Legoshi told Louis that he wouldn’t accept eating Louis’ foot just because he told him to, because that would be an excuse. Legoshi would eat Louis’ foot because as a wolf, he hungered for it. And that was the true act of friendship: a carnivore giving into his instincts of craving flesh, **yet subverting it to protect a herbivore**, and a herbivore willingly giving him a piece of himself to give him the strength to survive. The moth metaphors throughout the season also serve Legoshi as a reminder to value life you consume- from larva to Louis' leg. While the moths weren't really there in the fight, Riz saw Legoshi's unwavering ideals and was blindsided in the fight. 


That is why Riz gave up. Riz saw a true bond between carnivore & herbivore with Legoshi & Louis, a bond he had been deluding himself into believing he had with Tem for a year, knowing that it wasn't true. Riz realized he was lying to himself, that killing Tem was one-sided murder, and he couldn’t live with that so he stopped fighting. 


>Only good thing was Louis plot, and even that was ruined in the finale

Address a few common questions:

Why did Ibuki have to die? Ibuki died because it’s a mafia trope that you don’t just leave the mafia, and they had already let Louis leave once. Ibuki obviously cared about Louis & didn’t want Louis to leave, so he took him on a drive to talk him out of it. He also did not want to be a part of the mafia without Louis because Louis had saved him and the mafia. When Ibuki realized he couldn’t change Louis’s mind, he gave Louis an ultimatum: “kill me or i’m going to kill you,” knowing full well that it was suicide either way. If Ibuki had killed Louis, Free would have killed him for killing Louis as per his instruction. Or, he would die by the boss he respected and cared for. Either way, Ibuki did not want to live in a world without Louis, and he belonged to the mafia, so the only solution he saw to this was death. Free honored Ibuki's word by killing him, and let Louis go for the last time.


Why did Louis offer up his leg? Louis wanted Legoshi to eat his leg to break his curse. Throughout the entire show, Louis envied the strength of carnivores. He always saw himself as weak. That’s why he leaned so heavily into his role in the mafia. He was told by his father growing up never to cry, because it was a sign of weakness in herbivores. He was top in school to be above carnivores. When he killed the lion boss in the season 1 finale, he felt like he had finally achieved real power as a herbivore over carnivores, and not just any carnivores- lions. He did heinous things in the Black Market, betrayed himself as a herbivore by eating meat, all in order to maintain a semblance of control over carnivores. He felt power controlling those that had victimized him as a child. But after spending time with Legoshi & Ibuki (and being told by both of them that Louis had saved them), he realized his own strength. He could be strong as a herbivore, so he asks Legoshi to take away the symbol of his oppression as a Black Market victim that had been a reminder of his perceived weakness (his curse) marked on his body since he was born and sold."

It's hard to get good sleep in a hostile environment.

Dust it, even symbolically, and sweep all the energy up in there, and shoo it out the window. I'd air it out, then when I was all finished cleansing, I'd do a warding and sprinkle salt across the threshold just inside the door (if the room isn't carpeted, take a soft welcome mat to lay down inside the door. The salt won't be visible in the fibers), and on the window sills.

J'ai rencontré (ici en France, donc c'est peut-être biaisé) un argentin et un cambodgien qui travaillaient au moins dès 16 ans et qui ""entreprenaient"" déjà leur vie, leur voyage, leur futurs investissement d'une manière que je ne m'étais jamais posé la question. Encore en France on part beaucoup plus tôt du foyer familial que d'autres pays d'Europe (Italie, Espagne).

Je crois que ce retard de maturation a un double effet: certains profite de ce temps de maturation s'ils sont entreprenant, coursgeux, curieux ou débrouillard et prenne une direction qui leur sont propre. 
D'autres profite de ce temps pour faire suivre la mode, pour rentrer dans la culture populaire, se faire accepter. C'est tout à fait normal, ça l'était avant. Mais ça dépend de la culture, et la culture populaire de maintenant par de multiple forme de média de communication en partie idolâtre les riches (Elon Musk, les freelancers qui partent à Dubaï...).

None of us have perfect. I’ve sinned greatly against God. That’s why I’m so thankful for the grace and forgiveness offered to me through Jesus Christ. I attached some applicable verses that I think you should read. In general, I’d really suggest reading the Bible and understanding the gospel; it absolutely changed my life and I’m hoping it can do the same for you. God bless ❤️

And when he has found it, he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders. When he arrives, he will call together his friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.’ In the same way, there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God than over ninety-nine others who are righteous and haven’t strayed away!”

But I like Phil actually. ) In Aptera's case it may just be fake it 'til you make it. When you look at their SEC filings they spend a LOT on marketing. Too much for a startup at the phase they are in. Beyond that they seem to not make concrete predictable (boring) progress.  At the phase they are in they should be sitting on a final small number of hand built prototypes that are street legal and ready for homologation.  Every aspect should be locked in and all tooling complete.  The drive train change is substantial.  It changes the definition of the trike.  But we'll see. They have now committed to final units at CES in a couple of months. These should be the real deal.

Or you reduce spending elsewhere. Isn’t that what Musk is supposedly planning on doing now?

>Third: I have no problems with immigrants, trump only has a problem with immigrants that cross the border illegally and stay here. As long as they have their papers, they can come in, hell, I’ll roll out the red carpet

You say that but Trump had all kind of fear mongering and hate speech about immigrants. “They’re poisoning the blood of our country” and all the bullshit with the pet eating. They’re just people.

>Fifth: Kamala Harris appeals to Never Trumpers, and that’s about it. She constantly alienates the working class (whether by accident or on purpose) because she doesn’t really seem to have a grip on what to do for working class Americans. As a result, she is stuck trying to reach groups that already have heavy controversy around them or are minorities. You can’t win a country on just minorities, although they are important and are people too. The radical stances she took just didn’t match the American people

She actually stated and documented her plans to help the working class. But a lot of people just didn’t listen because I don’t know Trump told them not to or because she’s a woman of color. Who knows. But if you actually looked at her website (I looked at Trumps and hers) and her plan was laid out very clearly and plainly and with support to show why it would help.

Unfortunately, you drew the short straw with Tesla. I actually thoroughly enjoyed putting miles on the loaner car instead of my own. Again nobody's perfect. If you think Toyota is Honda would have taken better care of you, good luck!"

Libertarians are literally ""the"" most pro-personal rights, lol. You're picking a single contentious issue that pits the individual rights one against the believed individual rights of another. This is why most libertarians *actually* choose to stay out of this argument completely, and leave it up to the morality of the individual, realizing that there are two counteracting morally based arguments being had. 
Oh they're *against* abortion? Who cares. It's s an opinion, not a policy that they are crushing down on people via weaponized government.
Can you find any place where they have *ever* posted that they would make it illegal in New Hampshire or a Libertarian society?
Libertarians are so pro personal rights, that within a libertarian society you could literally have a *voluntary* progressive society or commune.

Progressives converselydo not believe in personal property rights. Here's how you know.
But first, you're aware of that ""property"" doesn't just *literally* mean land, correct? 
I'll explain for you. ""Property"" refers to *anything* that any individual owns. This includes themselves, their labor, the product of their labor, the items they take ownership of, and yes, even their land. 

Progressives believe in taxation and redistributed wealth via a centralized democratically elected government. Again, any forced removal of another's property (labor) or belongings (assets if taxes aren't paid) is anti-property rights. You can continue to cherry pick a few odd left leaning theories that fall outside of those norms, but it's intellectual dishonesty to say compulsatory taxation and redistribution of wealth is not a core tenant of progressive society.

>you clearly understand that the planned economy you’re referring to is a stepping stone towards the eventual dissolution of the state. 

Direct translation: ""that backwards theory *relies on force* to get to freedom(?¿??!!).""

>it would be made by the CEO of a mega corporation aka technocratic feudal lords. 

Oh you mean versus our current lords/system that drone strikes children in Syria Yemen and Pakistan, funds and builds nukes to drop on innocent populations, commits planned atrocities against its citizens like Operation Northwoods/Mongoose/Sea-Spray/MKUltra to justify endless wars to colluse with the Military industrial complex *that it funds*, arms 86,000 IRS agents, monopolizes the use of force, executes coups in other nations to advance its interests, colludes with big medical, deliberately and diligently runs cover for child sex trafficking rings, and relies on a system in which 51% get to decide the livelihood of the other 49% through tyranny of the majority?

Reported shoplifting is down, no doubt about it but is this the case because retailers are just not calling police as often anymore as they use to. In cities such as LA, San Francisco or Seattle is shoplifting events actually down or did retailers just say it’s not worth the effort to report it because the police won’t do anything.

I live in a big Midwest city and from personal experience pre-Covid we called on almost everything and it was always an arrest. During Covid and we backed way off and police stopped arresting people for shoplifting. Now we’re in this weird phase where we don’t call as often as we use to but definitely more than during Covid and police only arrest for felonies now.

Actual shoplifting will always be a lot more than reported shoplifting so it’s hard to know actual trends."

it also, i think, made star wars fans uncomfortable in a way that even rivaled the prequels original release, it wanted SW to grow and it’s clear (by the way ppl still praise Rogue One) that the fans don’t want that rn. it’s why we’re trapped in the rise of the empire era and the only movies were getting are either prequels or feloni-driven stories. it’s tragic, but TLJ still reigns as one of my favorite films ever

Only thing is, it comes off as controlling and co-dependent this way, too.  Just without the scrutiny of Aurora and her boyfriend.

I get why the girls would want to join the church though - my guess is Aurora met this guy, he talked about all the great things he does at his church, and she realized this might be the only way she gets to actually have a life outside home and school.

I was so confused.

But it's an identity thing. By this point, identifying as ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" comes with a whole set of things that go with that. We on this sub tend to forget that, because, by definition, we don't go with the whole set of typically liberal identities: we own guns. But one of the most basic parts of liberal identity is ""THEY own guns; we are rational, so we don't."" Funny thing is, that's not necessarily a rational thought, it's an identity - it's a lizard brain, in-group/out-group feeling. But it's one that could get ""us"" killed if ""they"" get too riled up - and their Orange Jesus or his Musky handler could very well need to rile them up to keep their hands on the reins.

So, yeah, a lot of liberals feel like owning guns goes against their core beliefs - not me, not most of us here, because, well, we're here. But I'm a liberal because that's what America should be. I read it in the writings of Thomas Jefferson and Abigail Adams. America at its best is Susan B Anthony and Martin Luther King, but it's also Harriet Tubman and every volunteer for the Union army who took up arms to right a wrong. ""Liberals"" wrote the Second Amendment (to the extent that our modern labels can be applied to the 18th century) and I'm not letting some poorly-educated fascist take that away from me. But my view is not the common one, and I get that. OP asked this question as part of her soul searching. I'm glad. No one should acquire the ability to take a life without serious reflection. But stepping out of one's comfort zone is hard."

We can split opinions on discourse, but we cannot split opinions on free speech where X is concerned.  There are too many reports of things being removed, hidden, and people being banned to support anything you have said on this matter.

While you claim the ""platform still works"" there are no downtime statistics to support that conclusion.  Additionally I would hope it ""works"" as the load on it's servers is significantly lowered due to its much lower customer base.  With a 22% revenue decrease over 2023 and what looks to be even more of a drop for 2024 there is no evidence that Musk's management has done anything to actually make the platform ""better"" in any measurable way.

We are on an inevitable shift in government structure, social structure, perception of morality, and all the factors that go into the rise and fall of empires. The era of the American empire is on its way to the inevitable conclusion. 

My perception of what’s going to happen is a kind of soft revolution. There will certainly be more violence against the elite (like the UHC assassination) but I think most of it will be with the weapon of money. The rich fucks still need us to spend money in order to make money right? Well, Trumpy Trump Trump and Muskrat want to intentionally tank the US (and hence the world) economy. That’s going to put a lot of people out of work that rich people need to spend money. Just like during COVID they will have nothing better to do than protest and resist. If the energy can be captured correctly we push back by intentionally by not contributing to the economy they want to rebuild.  

Then there is the completely unpredictable factor of ecological collapse and impending weather patterns that make it impossible to continue living in certain regions of the US and world. Climate refugees will be complete chaos that will look unfavorably on any government in charge. This will only hasten the collapse. 

Fortunately, I don’t think we’ll have to wait decades to see a dramatic shift toward rebuilding. The rate of change has been increasing each economic cycle. The peaks and valleys keep getting higher and lower respectively, and closer together. We are at an all time high in many many ways of measuring an economy. The fall is going to be sharp, sudden, and disastrous. Even Buffet and Munger are warning of this impending collapse. And that it will be the biggest the world has ever seen.

Elon Musk cannot and will not put the United States before his companies. Tesla does extensive manufacturing in China and Musk cannot serve two masters, specifically communist China and the United States.

Tesla's Elon Musk was played by China's President Xi Jinping. The Chinese leader will continue to pressure Musk in an attempt to win concessions from Trump on issues such as tariffs and Taiwan (just two examples). Musk will fail to influence Trump on these matters as it was central to Trump's platform that, if elected, he would be ""tough on China"" in regard to tariffs and imperialistic aggression. Recall in Trump's first administration he did impose tariffs on China and funded defense to counter the perceived CCP military buildup.

When Musk fails to win the concessions, Beijing expects Musk to win from the incoming administration, Musk will be out of favor with both the Chinese communists and the incoming Trump administration. You already see that on display with the H-1B visa issue. In relation to China, Musk will be revealed as having acted with a conflict of interest and to have placed his business interests above the interests of the U.S.

Is one to believe that Beijing is going to carry water for Musk in an environment where the U.S. is engaged in policy Beijing perceives as hostile? Musk bet on extensive manufacturing in China and that makes Tesla economically vulnerable. Musk's China business interests make him subject to Chinese influence and perhaps blackmail. Musk is a pawn for Xi Jinping the leader of the second largest economy. Xi will crush Musk's Tesla the moment Musk ceases to be a loyal and obedient ambassador for Beijing."

>Elon Musk and his rocket company, SpaceX, have repeatedly failed to comply with federal reporting protocols aimed at protecting state secrets, including by not providing some details of his meetings with foreign leaders, according to people with knowledge of the company and internal documents.

>Concerns about the reporting practices — and particularly about Mr. Musk, who is SpaceX’s chief executive — have triggered at least three federal reviews, eight people with knowledge of the efforts said. The Defense Department’s Office of Inspector General opened a review into the matter this year, and the Air Force and the Pentagon’s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security separately initiated reviews last month.

>The Air Force also recently denied Mr. Musk a high-level security access, citing potential security risks associated with the billionaire. Several allied nations, including Israel, have also expressed concerns that he could share sensitive data with others, according to defense officials.

>Internally, SpaceX has a team that is expected to ensure compliance with the government’s national security rules. Some of those employees have complained to the Defense Department’s Office of Inspector General and other agencies about the lax reporting, which goes back to at least 2021, four people with knowledge of the company said. SpaceX was awarded at least $10 billion in federal contracts with the Pentagon and NASA from 2019 to 2023, making it a major contractor."

“Yeah.” Richie wet his lips as he began to pace. “No. I don’t know.” 

“What’s going on, man?” He could hear the worry in Ben’s voice as he spoke. Richie loved him for it. He couldn’t think of a single time that Ben hadn’t been ready to talk to any of them about a problem. Ben was good like that, almost too faithful for his own good.

There was silence on Richie’s end until he finally managed to blurt out, “What’s at the bridge, Ben?”

The main differentiating factor will be the AWD.  If you live in cold weather where it snows, this is important.  

Now, the main thing that Tesla will hands down do better than a similarly priced Subaru is long trips.  1 hr commute wouldn’t matter, but long trips will be significantly better on Tesla and its supercharger network.  We own both a model y and a Subaru Solterra so I speak from experience.  

Ride Quality is hands down better in Solterra.  If you seek comfort in your suspension and that more traditional car feel, Solterra is the answer.

Subscription-  Tesla remote key features are built in to the app without requiring subscription.  Solterra comes with 1 year remote key trial and then it’s like $8/month.  

TACC- Traffic aware cruise controls.  Overall I like the TACC on Subaru better. It’s smoother.  Also when you change a lane, it kicks in lane-keep automatically. When you do a lane change in Tesla you have to re-engage the lane-keep.  Side note- Tesla Full Self Drive is out of this world.  It’s friggin amazing.  But it’s not a necessity.  If you get Package 11 in Subaru, then you will have things like TACC, and other safety features comparable to Tesla features.  

Now, the big Kahuna… we love our Solterra, but Tesla is hands down the more fun car.  There is nothing else like it.  Right out the gate you get all standard features like automatic folding mirrors, powered seats, heated seats in front and back, a FRUNK!, software updates. If you have kids, they will love the “fart sounds” the “light show” the “games.”"

A new oligarchy will be firmly entrenched. Elon Musk will become the nation’s single largest landlord. A new generation of American serfs (who lost negotiation power due to the erosion of unions and Trump’s weakening of the NLRB) will rent everything from America’s new ruling class.

There’s nothing stopping billionaires from buying every piece of real estate they can now. 

The IRS’ own tax code makes real estate the more attractive investment because of advantages like writing off depreciation, interest, etc. 

When the CFPB lays down additional guidelines for agencies and lenders, they affect lower income borrowers disproportionately.  

So, government agencies are partially responsible for creating the excessive investor demand and then making it harder for non-1%’ers to get in on it.  Just food for thought."

He would give everyone an equal share. Burt started the whole no prize thing. Burt bragged to Sam about being able to afford a Tesla and not being broke. Burt bragged about making 30k a month and having no debt. 

Burt said on his YouTube Livestream that he wasn't aware all of the other fish were getting a day rate. He said the only reason he wanted to give away the prize was because he thought they weren't getting paid. He also said he didn't know they weren't guaranteed the prize (because production requires fish to earn the prize like tj and shinji) and settled on 15k.

Burt also said on his live that he went on fish tank to become famous. He didn't mention the money. Just that he was lonely and tired of being ignored. Burt wanted exposure and he got it. 

Yes Sam is a prick. But Burt said he and production agreed on 15k and helping him with his acting career. He mentioned they already have plans to bring him back for multiple shows. That's really what Burt wants, exposure and fame.

Also every fish that actively tried to win the prize, got their prize. The only fish in history not to, is Burt, and he didn't want it. Burt wanted to become famous and he is. There's so many people like you arguing on behalf of a man that doesn't even want the prize.

I'd argue that letting contestants split the prize absolutely ruins future seasons of fish tank and turns it into friend tank. Why fight when everyone is gonna win. What's the point in a comp if the final 2 can just give up and split the prize.

Why do you think it's a dogshit deal? What makes you so personally offended about someone not making money that they never wanted and never tried to win?"

This is lightning, and you want it offensive and supportive. Make it give the enemy both haste and exhaust, so they can run away from or towards you, but they get less dodges.

This makes for a much more interesting play and counterplay in the game against this figurative lightning weapon.

The haste adds utility as most mages already run that perk that gives them more damage on hasted opponents, so you slow down the stamina regen of bows that already get a lot of haste and then stack exhaust on them. But also now melee are exhausted, but they can approach you or run away faster.

This could allow it to pair very well with trapper musket for a disruptor assassin (a build that kills disruptors).

It would also go well with an SnS or even a FS. Exhaust your opponent and then burst them down with FS. Sacrificing the escape of rapier or abyss to enable the combo. Or get into the enemy back line and exhaust them all while they try to run away.

I could even see a lightning/IG build going well to counteract the slows and haste for exhaust at normal speed.

Otherwise lightning/IG would just be both slow and exhaust and that would be toxic. I know that much slow was already toxic when SnS/IG with 300 con was an off meta build. Just slow and grit an opponent while your team bursts them down. Adding exhaust to an IG user would be an insane support build.

Just my 2 cents."

- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)

Most people on the right have no problem with the existence of billionaires, as the modern day right mainly relies (philosophically) on classical liberalism, which basically saw no problem with any level of economic inequality as long as everyone was gradually becoming better off, which *is* still the case imo"

The kid who caused the crash was 20 years old. Just got out 10 years later, pretty sure he had a kid before he went in. Not only did he lose 10 years of his life, he now has multiple felonies, has a high likelihood of going back to prison because the world is completely foreign to him now. He has lifelong trauma after being the cause of the death of e teenagers, and also the trauma of what probably happened to him in prison. He was a good kid from a nice neighborhood, but his families money couldn't save him from shit when he was convicted of killing kids. 

After all of this, one of the girls who walked away with minor injuries was out drinking and partying and driving drunk a month later. This is fucking disgusting and I hope you never know what it's like to look a mother in the eyes and take ownership of murdering her child. Turn your shit around and do research.

If you're an American business and enjoy participating and prospering in the worlds biggest and most successful economy, then you have to moral obligation to hire and help the citizens of that economy.  Because the way the US system is set up, corporation are able to shape corporate tax rates and exploit the hell of write-offs and loop hole through lobbying efforts.  The citizens of this country have allowed you to accumulate mind blowing levels of wealth so return the favor and hire local.

There are a couple very easy fixes to this problem for boards that do not want to play ball.  

1.  If their complaint is American labor is too expensive and they want to hire foreign HB-1 labor, then the payroll cost difference will be subsidized as an additional tax on services and goods sold by the corporation.  This additional tax cannot be passed off onto consumers through price increases.  If Tesla isn't filling 75% of their American positions with existing US citizens, then this can be weaponized and used as a penalty.

2.  The US government wastes mind blowing amount of tax payer funds.  Id even be open to subsidized payroll for cost difference between HB-1 and us citizens as long as these corporations are growing and filling American positiosn.  Can't imagine it would cost more than the funds we're actively sending to Israel or Ukraine.

3. If corporations aren't happy with paying their fair share of taxes and try to move their headquarters off shores/out of country to avoid US taxes, then they should either be charged an appropriate tariff as penlty or flat out ban from participating in the American economy.

All of this is possible, we just need our government officially to setup and do what is right for once in their miserable lives."

Ein paar verschiedene Aufstriche vorbereiten, zum Beispiel für die Saison passend ein Kürbischutney, Antipasti wie Zucchini oder Auberginenaufstrich, ein Apfel-Zwiebel Chutney, ""Winterpesto"" (fein pürierter Grünkohl oder Spinat, herzhaft angemacht mit Öl, Kümmel, Knoblauch und Muskat) und ähnliche herzhafte Aufstriche mit saisonalem Gemüse. Das dann entweder einfach mit Baguettescheiben reichen oder warme Tortillas oder Naan-Scheiben dazu. Als ergänzender Belag geht auch Käse wie Feta oder andere Antipasti. Da kann man sich gesellig was zusammenstellen. Kannst auch kleine Minipizzen mit dem Aufstrich vorbacken und in handlichen Vierecken anrichten. Dazu Salat, vielleicht sogar einen Brotsalat.

Als weitere Ergänzung würde auch eine Kürbiscremesuppe oder Brokkolicremesuppe gut in die Saison passen. Lässt sich auch super vorbereiten."

Also we don't know when they became bethrothed no? It might have been set-up before it became obvious that Aemon will not have a male heir.

Then Aemon dies, Baelon dies very quickly after him. Jaeharys was a master at managing his realm, but he wasn't omniscient, we have the benefit of hindsight, we know Jocelyn won't have children and the spare will die before his father as well. Rhaenys marrying Viserys is fine. Marrying the Sea Snake is better. It only becomes a problem if and only if Aemon doesn't have another kid, Baelon dies before he ascends the throne and whoever succeeds Baelon does what Viserys did.

Diese Einladung kommt auch nicht überraschend, wenn man betrachtet, wie viele neue [Zusammenarbeitsinitativen zwischen Polen und Schweden](https://www.government.se/articles/2024/11/nordic-baltic-summit-and-new-partnership-with-poland/) um diesen Gipfel angekündigt wurden.

  
Ansonsten ist es ja normal, verschiedene Formate für Gespräche zu nutzen. Scholz hat auch am 20.10. zu seinem Gespräch mit Biden Macron und Starmer eingeladen, als es um die Ukraine ging, aber Tusk nicht, was die Polen verstimmt hat. Auch das Telefonat mit Putin war ein Alleingang, der unseren europäischen Nachbarn nicht gefallen hat.

Als Trump neulich von Macron zur Wiedereröffnung der Notre-Dame eingeladen war, sind Meloni und Zelensky gekommen, aber Scholz ist nicht mit Steinmeier mitgeflogen. Unterhaltsamerweise hat er stattdessen in Deutschland auf einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung darüber berichtet, wie eng er seine Ukrainepolitik mit seinen Partnern abstimmt.

  
Generell ist es meiner Meinung nach nicht das Ende der Welt, wenn Deutschland nicht bei jedem Treffen immer seine Finger im Spiel hat.  Es wäre natürlich toll, wenn wir als so unersätzlicher europäischer Sicherheitspartner gesehen würden, dass dies immer Sinn macht, aber die europäische Partizipation und Führung unserer Regierung in den letzten Jahren hat uns einfach nicht in eine solche Rolle gebracht."

They have no entitlement towards your freaking home or any kind of your belongings.

Now, if he violates terms, then yeah Ban that account. But I’m hopeful I won’t have to see his posts even if he isn’t.

I don't know what the custody arrangements are, and how often your step daughter stays, but I also do understand him giving lower priority to his daughter's sometime need for privacy and belonging over his full-time need for work privacy and belonging.   

It seems to me that the best arrangement is for him and his daughter to have a shared bedroom / home office.  He thinks her sharing a room is fine; cool, he can share the room with her.  He uses it exclusively 9am-5pm, she uses it exclusively 5pm-9am on the days she's there.  She can do her homework at the kitchen bench, if necessary. 

Long-term, you both might want to build/buy a shed / extension for him, especially if you're all living in ""your"" house.  English-based cultures have a high need for privacy and 'a room of their own', which applies to yourself, husband, son, and step-daughter.

So if you see some people selling crafts claiming to be associated with a tribe but the tribe doesnt claim them then easily you can label that pretendian. It wasnt really ever intended to be applied in a more complex context. 

Like we all know there are both legitimate and illegitimate federally unrecognized tribes. If you said anyone outside of a federally recognized tribe is a pretendian then thats already incorrect. Not to mention the people unenrolled in their FRTs for various reasons like you said. 

Thats why the gain or profit aspect in defining pretendian is pretty important to me. It’s not just about people saying theyre native when they arent, because there are a lot of those people who can be ignored without consequence. But the people who are claiming heritage they dont have for the purpose of taking money that could have gone to real natives, or taking positions in academia that belong to real natives, or even just skewing academia with fake bullshit and the impact that has if people think it is legitimate, etc. those people are the real intended target of the word because they are engaging in real harm"

And those who know better (if they truly do know better), are rewarded by market, which allows their ideas to spread. If their ideas are good, they become widely adopted and create prosperity. If their ideas are wrong, they get reality checked and discarded. If we regulate (economic and idea) market based on opinion of select few, who dont even pay the price of being wrong (beaurocrats), it will inevitably lead to oligarchy of authority.

\>Merriam-Webster; government by the people, the simplest and most concise answer that I believe gets at the heart of why democracy is a good thing.

Government by the people is (even mathematically) impossible concept, because there is no way for people to ever be in control of government (or fairly represented) and be functional. It will be a deadlock, division, infighting and collapse. Thats why there is no direct democracy in existence. Best you can do is half-assed ""representative"" democracy, which is extremely broad in its nature and can even include Democratic Republic of Korea (which claims to represent its people, like pretty much every other ""democratic"" government). Not exactly that good of a thing anymore, heh?

\>I'm guessing that you only believe in negative rights and that the government can't possibly attempt to create positive outcomes for people like providing them shelter or healthcare

It can create... but what quality and at what cost. In my country, when we had communism, technically everyone was provided those things... but shelter was almost unlivable for most, our diet was 85% bread and potatoes and healthcare was rudamentary. Breaking a leg was lifelong disability. Wanted something better, you had to be part of the party (and have sway in it).

\>So the government is really just there to keep the poors in line

No, government is there to judiciate and keep society safe from outside threats. Lifes of their citizens should not be dictated by it."

Basically the owner was ready to part with him because they don't ride anymore, but didn't want to A) separate him from his lifelong best friend and B) leave their other horse alone, so I agreed to start caring for their horses again in exchange for boarding for my personal horse. I go several times a week after work to tend to them but currently is only able to train on week-ends, we have a spot light that's decently bright but I still don't trust working him at nighttime (there's no arena, just a flat piece of ground outside the paddock). They don't really expect the horse to be trained either, it's just something I started doing because I had a lot of free time back then. He's a sweetheart to be around in the pasture (very good at being tacked up and mounted too), at least, it's really any activity away from the friends that gets him the most riled up. 

Totally agree on the consistency though. I want to get more regular with him too, somehow, I guess I just don't want to push him too far and get him sick of me, in a way.

I was surprised to see him go as high as he did in the draft especially coming back from injury, MN is going to have a lot of explaining to do for a long time if JJ ends up not setting the world on fire vs. the departing (likely) 4000 yd 40 td QB who is only 27 years old and seems to fit your current system perfectly. 

I obviously want to see JJ succeed in the near term, but I will be surprised if the McCarthy Vikings are better than the GEQBUS Vikings. 

I thought the same of Tom Brady coming off of his championship though (decent quarterback surrounded by an amazing cast), and I was about as wrong as someone can be on that one."

Excuse some minor overlapping in the picture, I stitched it together from 6 screen shots.

I tried to achieve continuous, robust and safe mass production of Agri science:

* Have a compact, modular build for a full belt of agri science (\~15k/min) with good ratios and bioflux as the only input
* No pentapod eggs on belts and automatic recovery from any possible fail state
* Always keep all belts moving to prevent any unnecessary spoilage progress!
* 16k common science packs available for export at any time
* Excess science is upcycled and readied in silos for export as available -> maximize potential science
* Spoilage of no less than 90% when launching the rockets



I think I achieved these goals pretty accurately. The science module has the following ratios:



https://preview.redd.it/q19c0rd3xw4e1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=1598eb8628e8faf00ca45026f04555a1b642c518

Almost exactly a full belt of science as output with bioflux (and water) as the only inputs. The Egg to Science ratio is almost perfect and they are all direct inserted, never on belts. The very slight surplus is desirable to have a buffer in the biochambers. 

This has been the most challenging module to design in Space Age for me so far by quite a bit. Every splitter and end of belt requires spoilage clearance and every Biochamber requires a way to automatically cold start when stopped. In addition, the nutrient requirements for pentapod eggs are extreme, so belting the nutrients through the module was no option. They are mostly direct inserted as well with a few short belts on top. The Bioflux requirements are a bit more than a full belt and since I like to have belts not fully packed on Gleba, I belt two full belts of bioflux through the whole module that are continuously balanced and need to add up to around 1.2 belts of input across the two. 

Finally, I tested the case of failure when all eggs hatch which was surprisingly hard to deal with (200+ pentapods per module) without losing buildings. Epic+ Tesla towers and some Gun Turrets are required to be completely safe, but you can probably use less if you don't mind losing a couple buildings on failure. The build as is should never be able to stall or fail as long as bioflux output is not completely stopped for 30+ minutes.



The end results is 24 Rocket silos where 16 have common, 4 uncommon, 2 rare and 1 each epic and legendary science. Common and Uncommon will be full every roundtrip of the Space ship and any excess is upcycled (belts always moving) and the higher quality stuff is picked up when enough is available and skipped otherwise. I also really tried to get mixed science rockets to work, but it is a huuuge pain in the ass and I honestly don't think it is feasible. The current solution is very efficient however and does not waste any potential science. If you don't need agri science for a few hours, you will come back to tons of rare, epic and legendary science when you need it again.

Other products from this factory are:

* All excess seeds are converted to overgrowth soil and exported to be launched to my deep space research ship for biter supply (explained in my last post)
* Any excess bioflux is upcycled until legendary to have a steady supply of legendary bioflux for more biochambers, biolabs and biter spawners. The balance between science and legendary flux can be adjusted seamlessly by changing the amount of flux belted into the science modules.

That's Gleba done for quite a while I think! On to other planets and space ships :)"
5,2024-12-27,u/redeyesdeaddragon,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1hnk705/releasing_anger_and_hurt/m42xdw8/,"I am in a similar situation and I'm contemplating a transformative spell to send that emotional energy back to the people it belongs with - my parents. I am working with the ocean for this, as I've worked with it in the past to transform myself. 

I originally thought of hexing, but realized that would cause them to harm others in my absence, including my siblings. And ultimately, what I want isn't to cause them pain - it's to force them to face themselves and either change or be consumed by it. 

I personally am not a fan of cord cutting for addressing emotions. It's great for saying ""this is over, I'm done, I am severing the connection,"" but it does absolutely nothing to discharge emotional energy or get you justice and closure beyond serving to disconnect you from them. 

I can't tell you what's right for you, but I can suggest what I've done - sit with it. Feel it. Really dig into it and start to understand the breadth and depth of how much they failed you. Dig into what made them like this - I know my mother herself is traumatized, but rather than face it, she blamed everyone around her for her entire life. There's a lot of internal emotional work to be done after a choice like this.

I recommend a few books for trauma in this vein - Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, You are Not the Problem by Helen Villiers, Toxic Parents by Susan Forwards, and Waking the Tiger by Peter Levine. 

Keep in mind that you will need to do transformative work on yourself as well to break these patterns and shed the conditioning from your childhood. It's easy to be like my mother, blame your parents, and do no self reflection. It's hard to recognize that in being hurt by your parents, you've been trained to behave in ways that can hurt others as well. Breaking that cycle is the most freeing work you can do, magically or otherwise. 

Best of luck."

Tell them you didn't ask for their input, and you've had enough with everyone's interference, and going forward anyone trying to tell you what to do won't be invited. Seriously, shut it down, give yourself the gift of peace and the wedding you want.

You can simply say my brother was my father who raised me when my mother couldn't after my own father died, and I am honoring him this way. Your stepdad can't use you to fulfill his fantasy of having a daughter to walk down the aisle. This is *your and your fiance's* wedding, not your stepdad's or anyone else's, and you get to create the wedding *you* want, not what anyone else wants. DO WHAT WILL MAKE *YOU* HAPPY, don't worry about pleasing other people. I can't believe the audacity of people who think they get a say in other people's weddings, I'm floored by the number of posts I see on reddit with all these family members trying to interfere, when it's not their place.

OP, you have a lifelong relationship with your brother, who was there for you, took care of you, and helped raise you during such a difficult time in your life. It would be beautiful to honor him this way. Ask your brother to walk you down the aisle bc it's what *you* want. Tell your stepfather that this is your final decision and not to bring it up again. He didn't come into your life until you were an adult and was not a father to you, and should NOT expect to get to have the honor of walking you down the aisle just bc he has the legal title of stepfather and bc he's sad he didn't have a daughter himself, it's not up to you to fill that void. 

Your wedding is about YOU, not him. Shut down everyone who criticizes you - tell them it's not up for discussion, they don't need to concern themselves with optics that actually AREN'T weird, that you didn't ask for their opinions, and if they have a problem with it they don't need to come or that you won't invite anyone who gives you grief about a decision that is personal to you, and that is for you to make. Don't engage further, just tell them it's not their business, and block them if they keep pestering you."

Honestly hindsight is 20/20 and Biden only won in ‘20 because mail in voting made voting more convenient and that we were hot off the heels of a pandemic that the orange tumor elect had let ravage. If not for those factors, I’m sure the orange tumor elect would’ve gotten his second term in ‘20. 

The dems only ran on “we’re not the orange tumor elect” and won in ‘20 because of it. The dem’s incompetence cannot be expressed in words due to how much incoherent rage I have towards the party. I will still continue to vote D cause they’re not the party foaming at the mouths cause they believed an almost trillionaire asshole get “elected” then insulted by said trillionaire but by god are the dems absolutely fucking stupid. 

The dems had a moderate shot at winning had they had a prelim for their candidate but nope, Biden had to announce reelection after for his entire term stating he’s a one term pony. Fine, old white guy vs old orange tumor. Then he only backs down due to health reasons after the time passed to have an effective prelim so the only candidate that could run is Harris. Do I love Harris? Nope. Do I like her? Not at all. Did I vote for her? Yes because she ain’t the orange tumor and she’s supposedly known as the prosecutor and I wanted to see her live up to the title by sending Donnie to jail alongside Leon Muskrat. 

The dems ran what felt like a second Clinton campaign but leaned more right than anything tryna steal the waning right wingers who were tired of the orange tumor. The right did mudsling more effectively by just drowning everyone in the belief that the dems were pro trans surgeries on kids and other grifter selling points but in actuality Harris was silent on any lgbtq topics and ran a half decent campaign but she lacked the same charisma that Obama had and that I as a straight man would say yes if he propositioned me.

Also never had an orgasm or felt close. Also can’t get aroused. Also had painful PIV even with lube— burning ripping feeling despite there is lube. 

It’s not her thyroid. It’s not her hormones. 

I recommend starting with you both reading the book “the elusive orgasm” which has actionable steps. 

She needs to put in the work before her mind Frater negative highway wide pathways of negativity around sex as always being frustrating, painful, and disappointing. Also don’t have sex she doesn’t want cause that reinforced this. Doesn’t have PIV is it’s painful cause that also reinforces these negative pathways in he brain that block arousal and pleasure. 

I wound always just do it anyway- I’d grit my teeth and endure it as duty and that did not gel reinforce potions mindset around sex. I had no idea what I was doing was harmful since I was fully consenting. Reading these books have helped me understand. I have not been able to successfully change my mindset to date but I at least understand that the battle is in the mind as that is where arousal and orgasm comes from!!! 

My body needs >1hr of slow massage working into foreplay to get even a hint of sexual response… but that alone stopped painful PIV for me which helps makes progress. 

Another books after the elusive orgasm is to read the book come as you are and better sex through mindfulness. All of these books have actionable therapy steps and really work on the depose roots to anorgasmia… and I’ve read and studied and experimented a lot in my 42 years. 

Yes I’ve been to doctors and had full workup a and even demanded they let me try HRT. Yea this is a lifelong issues. No I’m not any meds and have zero mental health issues and zero abuse history. It’s just always been this way. Apparently I have minimal if any accelerators yet plenty of breaks in my sexual response. 

Get to reading! Its fine to check out the medical but I wound out money on it that it’s not medical."

I would want to prefix by saying when youre living abroad, it is about your perspective and how you choose to deal with the negatives. Your home and safe space switches from your surroundings to you. The first year here I really struggled but ive settled in now and can give you my honest opinions.

1. Culture: youre gonna experience culture shock and its normal. This will feel like depression, questioning if you did the right thing, and feeling a general discomfort and like you dont belong.  The architecture is different, the weather, the smell of the air, the people, the language, the food, everything will be different. 

2. Socialising: Italians are social people but also (from my experience) really dislike speaking English. If you want some semblance of a normal life, ou will need to learn italian and also put yourself out there to socialize in it. They are quite passionate in the way they communicate with strong views and preferences to all things italian haha

3. Dating: Italians are naturally flirty.. and from my experience (and other expats I know) the stereotypes of playing games, cheating and highly emotional ""dramatic"" romances is a thing and very normal. Dont be suprised if your partner has a wife, a mistress and a girlfriend lol.."

1,2024-12-02,u/TKDeuel,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitnessDE/comments/1h4ft0j/hilfeinput_anfangsschwierigkeiten/lzzy27g/,"Ich rege mich nicht auf. Ich korrigiere dich, weil du mich verschlimmbesserst. Du berücksichtigst nämlich 0, dass OP KEINE Fortschritte macht. Und als Anfänger überhaupt RIR zu haben ist nicht empfehlenswert. Einerseits behauptest du, dass Anfänger es simpel halten sollen, andererseits argumentierst du mit RiR. RIR wird frühestens als Fortgeschrittener relevant. Bei Anfängern ist es deutlich wichtiger eine starke Superkompensation zu erreichen. Damit der Wachstumsreiz und auch stetig Wachstumshormone ausgeschüttet werden. 

Dass man mit einem Split tendenziell mehr im gym ist, ist halt de facto falsch. Ich bin mit meinem Split 3x1h/w wenn ich das auf GK ausweiten würde müsste ich mindestens 6x1h/w gehen um das selbe Volumen zu haben. Deswegen fährt man ja auch überhaupt ein Split. Um effizienter zu trainieren. 
Wie gesagt du empfiehlst OP ineffizientes und zeitverschwendendes Training - damit wird er keine Änderungen bemerken. 

Das bsp. Mit dem 12 Sätzen Bizeps ist realitätsfern, weil OP so ein Training gar nicht benötigt 😅 dir geht es nur darum Recht zu haben und nicht darum OP zu helfen. Du scheiterst nämlich konstant daran das ganze auf sein fall anzuwenden. Kein Anfänger wird 12x Bizeps machen. OP wird auch nicht 3x4 Bizeps machen, weil das unnötig as fuck ist. Trotzdem ist es halt Tatsache, dass Muskeln ein bestimmtes Volumen pro Woche benötigen um optimal zu wachsen. Das Volumen an einem Stück machen ist halt aus mehrern Perspektiven sinnvoller. Man spart sich Zeit im gym und die Superkompensation ist deutlich krasser. Die Superkompensation ist mit das wichtigste um langfristig Muskeln aufzubauen. 

Ich werde da auch nichts belegen. Weil das eigentlich Common Sense ist 😅 ich muss dich als random stranger on Reddit auch nicht überzeugen. Die erfolgreichen Coachings von verschiedensten Menschen und mein eigenes erfolgreiches Training geben mir ja in der Praxis auch Recht.

16,2024-12-08,u/Interesting_Second_7,https://www.reddit.com/r/monarchism/comments/1h99vst/the_syrian_dictatorship_has_fallen/m10iig5/,"To Westerners who don't know shit from apple butter it has CIA and Mossad written all over it.

To people who know anything at all about the Assad regime and the political dynamics in the wider region of the Levant and the greater Middle East, and who have been paying attention for the past nine years it was always obvious that if Iran and Russia were weakened, barring some other powerful ally entering the stage, the Assad regime's days would be numbered. Just as it was before Iran and Russia were able to help it re-establish control over most of Syria in 2015.

Baathist Syria had de facto minority rule. That's always a precarious position to be in even under more positive conditions. The regime was (understandably) deeply unpopular among the Sunni majority, and over the past week even Druze militias joined the anti-Assad forces. Meanwhile the Alawite elements in the military, the main backbone of the Assad regime, have been severely depleted over the past 13 years.

The regime had NO allies left in the immediate region aside from Iran and its proxies. Every single power in the region aside from Iran wanted it gone, even more so once it became a narco-state through its exploitation of captagon, which was generating more money for the regime than the country's entire GDP. In addition, every other power in the wider region wanted to limit Iran's influence in the region, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, all of whom invested heavily in the opposition from the start of the civil war. Turkey even led several incursions into Syria, and has part of the country's northern border regions under its control.
Iran overstretched itself in its conflict with Israel, its proxies have been decimated, and for nearly three years now Russia has been engaged in a suicidal war that also left it incapable of protecting its other former ally Armenia. 

In short: the regime's demise was the logical and predictable outcome of the weakening of the Russian Federation, Iran, and the Iranian proxies. Will the situation get worse? If I had to take a bet I would say the odds are that yes, it will get worse for the country's minorities. That doesn't mean this outcome wasn't entirely logical without CIA or Mossad involvement. In fact considering how preoccupied the Mossad is it requires a great deal of artistic license to come up with a way it could have orchestrated a mass uprising against a regime that wasn't already moribund. The kind of artistic license that belongs in alt-history fan fiction. The same goes for the CIA. If the CIA or the Mossad were able to orchestrate uprisings of this magnitude with such ease, causing hostile governments to unravel in mere days there would be a lot less hostile governments in the world today.

There is no question Israel will be pleased with the collapse of what had in essence become an Iranian client state. So will Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, all of whom were far more active in Syria than either the CIA or the Mossad. And Turkey in particular is the main victor on the international stage. And Israel will be less please with that particular outcome.

Was the CIA informed of what was happening and maintaining contact with informants on the ground? Very likely, and the same goes for any intelligence agency with any interests in the region. Was it likely feeding the rebels information of strategic importance? Again, very likely, and again the same goes for any intelligence agency with interests in the region. That's how contemporary international politics in conflict zones function. Was this a CIA/Mossad orchestrated series of events? No, obviously that belongs in the realm of fan fiction."
1,2024-12-11,u/ODMONKEYMOON,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace/comments/vztqp0/fellow_ethnically_ambiguous_people_what_are_your/m1kxmtr/,"Dating can be a bit challenging in my experience. I’m Mexican and Northern Italian, but because my mom is Mexican and has very ambiguous features, people often assume a wide range of ethnicities when they meet us. My Vietnamese friends have even told me they thought she looked Asian at first glance. Personally, I’ve been mistaken for just about every ethnicity.

I actually love being a cultural “chameleon” — it gives me the unique ability to authentically connect with and experience a variety of cultures since people often aren’t sure where I belong. However, this ambiguity comes with its challenges, especially in dating. Because I don’t fit neatly into any specific box, it sometimes feels like potential partners struggle to see a long-term future with me. I don’t match the traditional or alternative ideals of what they’ve envisioned in a partner, and that can feel isolating.

I don’t hold it against anyone, and I try not to let it weigh on me too heavily. Still, there’s a subtle bias I notice. While my background doesn’t seem to impact short-term connections, it can feel like a barrier when it comes to building something more lasting. It’s a strange place to exist, knowing you might not fit into anyone’s traditional romantic narrative. 

Sometimes, I also feel like I don’t have a singular culture to call my own, if that makes sense. On one hand, I love knowing that I’m connected to so many parts of the world because of the diverse backgrounds that came together to make my birth possible. It’s a beautiful reminder of how interconnected humanity can be.

But on the other hand, it can feel isolating. The people who, in theory, should be the most understanding and receptive of my background are sometimes the ones who reject me the most. It’s not the majority, but those negative experiences have a way of standing out and lingering in your mind.

Still, I wouldn’t change it. Being able to experience the world from such a unique perspective — unfiltered by any single cultural identity — is a rare gift. It’s allowed me to connect with a wide range of people and experiences, and for that, I’m deeply grateful. Despite the challenges, I wouldn’t trade this opportunity for anything."

No question some schools make a lot of money from international students. That’s probably good for their local (often college town) economy since these students often pay 3x the local student price for the same education. If they aren’t good students, they probably aren’t getting hired. Assuming the same set of skills, I can’t think of a company that would prefer to hire someone with a visa over a US citizen. Remember also that some of these international students end up starting companies that create more jobs and wealth for citizens—Elon Musk, Jensen Huang. Well educated international students who do get jobs pay taxes, etc. Immigrants help power the US economy. The US should want to be the preferred destination for the world’s best and brightest.

It was locked for a whole week, then after that, I logged in only to find out it got suspended immediately after. So when you get suspended (you can’t even repurpose an old account which I’ve tried to do or make one with a similar username) it just gets suspended to. ELON is nuts as fuck."

Americans who felt the sting of inflation and who had trouble making ends meet, as companies [steadily increased prices for essential goods](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/economy/inflation-food-prices.html) like groceries and clothing, voted in the hopes that a new administration and new Congress would bring relief for their families.  

So it is especially surprising that one of the first federal agencies to come under scrutiny from the incoming administration is one that has returned billions of dollars to many of the same consumers who were counting on leaders in Washington to look out for their wallets.  

On Nov. 27, [Elon Musk ](https://thehill.com/people/elon-musk/)— who, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, has been tasked by President-Elect Trump with running a new [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-department-of-government-efficiency-doge-elon-musk-ramaswamy/) — posted on his platform X that he [wants to “Delete CFPB,”](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/27/congress/delete-cfpb-musk-calls-for-elimination-of-consumer-bureau-00191994) referring to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The agency, Musk said, was part of a problem of “too many duplicative regulatory agencies” in Washington. But there are no other agencies in the federal government returning money to Americans’ bank accounts in the way the CFPB does. 

Since its founding, the agency [has returned more than $19 billion](https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-wants-delete-federal-214133728.html) in cash to people who have been scammed by financial institutions, including predatory payday lenders and even some of the largest banks in the country. It has done so under Republican and Democratic presidents, including major actions against Wells Fargo and Equifax during President Trump’s first term in office, which, combined, returned $425 million to consumers. (Those actions both began under the Obama administration, but Trump’s CFPB directors oversaw the execution of those fines.)

Although Nvidia powers Elon’s AI processors, he still needs a CPU to direct the AI cluster’s massive processing power. Pat Gelsinger’s post confirms that the xAI team chose Intel Xeon processors to drive their AI head node. Team Blue launched its latest 128-core flagship CPU called Granite Rapids in September 2024, but Gelsinger did not confirm which model the team uses.  
>  
>The Intel CEO also praised Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies and the current provider of xAI’s head node servers — at least those pictured here. Musk previously purchased systems from Supermicro, but it's unclear if the Dell servers are used in place of other Supermicro offerings — it is entirely possible that the company chose to use Dell head nodes while continuing to outfit the rest of the data center with Supermicro gear. 

I wonder how big a deal is this for Intel. From what I can tell, the head node is a pretty small subset of the overall server farm."

He shot off his mouth stupidly and said he'd buy it as a form of juvenile trash talk, like someone telling a waiter that he hates a restaurant so much that he's going to buy the place and burn it to the ground. But this joke of a legal system said, nope - you've got to buy it.

Musk tried to get out of it - he doesn't make a practice of buying *existing* tech he doesn't understand, because he needs a deep sense of how shit works. If he had been forced to buy Chrysler or Boeing, he'd have done the same thing - tear down everything that already exists and start over. That's his process.

Twitter was losing $2B a year when he bought it. He reduced headcount by 80%. Twitter still seems to be functional, so his argument about massively inflated headcount seems to have been accurate. Traffic has dropped by ~50%, but a lot of those users would have probably left anyway due to Musk's political views. Social media CEO's have to keep their political views to themselves. Musk is incapable of this, so he's a horrible fit as the owner of Twitter, but remember again that he was forced to buy it. 

I expect we're about to see Musk do the same thing with some federal agencies - gut them, fire 80% of the staff, and cause an absolute shitstorm. A year or so later the agency will function smoothly again - with its vastly reduced overhead intact. 

Personally, I hope they start with the Pentagon."

I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.

I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby.

And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.

My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent.

I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.

My grandma was a single mother when her son was born, and right after her husband, for 2 years, walked out on her, she then ended up being a single mother until her son turned 13, which then she remarried to another man who also has a son. The husband got half of his mom's land, which had nothing on it. My grandma then bought the other half from his brother with her retirement; they then built a house worth around $600,000 on loan. Her new husband is partially blind but has a business that is owned by a government program. Very early into the marriage, the husband ends up sleeping on the couch; his reason is bad back problems, so at this point all romance stops. Her son turns 18 and is kicked out by the husband while she is at work without telling her. Fast forward 40-something years: the husband's 40-year-old adult child is still living with them, and he refuses to kick him out. The husband still sleeps on the couch all this time, and the husband is now fully blind. The wife who worked the whole relationship and made more than the husband's business. The wife actually ran the business while he sat at home doing nothing.The wife also does all the housework, starting with dishes, feeding animals, cooking, shopping, driving, cleaning, picking anything up, and so on, while she takes care of her husband's every need while the adult man-child does nothing. He also doesn't pay for his own car insurance, phone bill, credit card debt, food, or any bills or jobs. The worse part is if you ask him for help, he will say no and be mouthy. When the adult man-child verbally attacks the wife, the husband doesn't defend her. Just recently, when the wife left the house at 1 am after being verbally abused by the husband's drunk son. The wife didn't receive a single text from the husband. The wife came home after crying, and to no shock, the husband was sleeping. The next day she talked to the husband to kick out his son, or she would end up divorcing him. They ended up telling his son he had 4 months to leave. He then posted on Facebook that the wife abuses the husband but soon after deleted it and apologized to the wife, begging her not to kick him out. Husband didn't care about the Facebook post and said he talked to him without her and said his son can stand longer than 4 months until he is ready. The husband then told her if she divorces him, he will take half her 401k. She then asked, Where would you live? He said, , ""Here."" When the man-child fought with the wife, he said this is his house; it belonged in the family for a long time, and he is never leaving; he has residency and called the wife crazy. The man-child has guns even though the wife and husband don't want guns in the house. The wife is now thinking divorce is the only option.

1,2024-12-30,u/cBuzzDeaN,https://www.reddit.com/r/Elektroautos/comments/1hnoeiv/vw_id_7_tourer_rant/m4hs0c7/,">Da liegt der Trugschluss, die Optik ist nicht alles. Z. B. Die Entwicklung der aus einem Aluminiumteil gsgossenen ""Hinterteils"" des Model Y (mir fehlt das akkurate Wort dafür). Es musste eine eigene Legierung entwickelt werden. Es ist das größte Druckgussteil das je am Stück hergestellt wurde. Spart dann in der Herstellung enorme Kosten.

Und ich wette dass der italienische (glaube ich) Hersteller der Presse mitentwickelt hat bis der Prozess inkl Legierung steht, ist schließlich der Experte und nicht Tesla.
Aber ist ja egal:
Ist eine Maßnahme die das Auto noch billiger macht.

>Oder das Octovalve für die Steuerung der Heiz- und Kühlwasserflüsse

Ocotvalve hat aus meiner Sicht den Vorteil dass sie mehrere Funktionen in nem einfachen Kunststoffbauteil vereint, also auch ne gute Maßnahme um Komplexität und Kosten einzusparen.

>Die Entwicklung findet in der Technik statt, die dann eben solche Margen ermöglicht. Während deutsche Hersteller sich um ein ""tolles Exterieur"" kümmern und das bitte alle zwei Jahre...

Nunja, wenn wir jetzt mal VW anschaue: die ID-Familie bekam ein Facelift mit neuem besseren Motor, neuer Inverter, bessere Hardware für zB schnelleres Infotainment, große Verbesserung im Infotainment insgesamt mit KI usw, neues Interieur das besser zu bedienen ist und ggf besser aussieht. Id.3 mit großer Batterie hat glaube ich eine größere mögliche Zuladung bekommen, d.h. auch Veränderungen in der Rohbaustruktur erfahren.

Und das alles in 3(?) Jahren..

Also nochmal: aus meiner Sicht hat sich da in über 10 Jahren nicht viel an den Teslas getan, die meisten und wenigen Veränderungen sind da um weiter Kosten zu sparen. Entwicklungskosten sind garantiert geringer als bei jedem deutschen OEM und ein Tesla müsste aus meiner Sicht noch günstiger sein als er eh schon ist."

This means that you don’t have the right to visit whenever you want. It’s a privilege and many people are refused entry. Only citizens have a right to enter the United States. “no one can change that?” Wrong!!! That visa can be revoked in the drop of a hat for a multitude of reasons. 

It is a myth that it is too easy to obtain a firearm here. Federally there is a background check required for every purchase from a dealer. With private sales you cannot sell to anyone with a felony or a domestic violence misdemeanor conviction. Some states require additional permits. Things that prohibit you from purchasing a firearm include criminal convictions, domestic violence, habitual drug use, mental illness, terrorist group affiliations, and buying handguns outside of your state of residence or attempting to circumvent your home state’s laws. You also cannot buy one for someone (straw purchase).

This doesn’t give you the right to possess one outside of your home. In half of states you need a permit to carry one and in states like NY and CA it is a very strict process. But here’s the thing - those states and inner cities have high rates of violence regardless, because criminal gangs still get them. 

But you are free to visit as a guest of the USA, but you aren’t permitted to change our policies, our laws, or even lobby our politicians (it’s illegal for non US citizens who aren’t permanent residents to donate to political candidates). So you can keep your gun ban wishes to Trinidad and you can do absolutely nothing about our right to keep and bear arms, which is one of the BEST things about the USA. 

Like I said - I’m more likely to face the barrel of a gun in Trinidad than here."

No, money is something we made up, it's not your body. How is saying that men who get pregnant should also get to have abortions ""turning anti-abortion when talking about men""? If two women adopt a baby together and then split do you think child support works differently than if it was a biological child? Or if a man and a woman adopted the child? If a man and woman split and the man gets custody, do you think the woman doesn't have to pay child support? (And before you cite any court statistics please know that men who *ask* for custody are actually favored by the courts against women, it's just that a lot of men don't even ask for custody - which skews the data). 

When it comes to the money part of parenting men and women are treated basically the same, because both parents need money to live. Abortion isn't because only one parent gets pregnant, so only one parent gets a say on what happens to the uterus. The parent that the uterus belongs to."

It was a combination of failures for this to happen. Lane management is still not even close to 100 percent solved. It gets in the wrong lane frequently which can be a main source of disengagements.

actually, yung peak nga nun eh yung pagkaka guest nila sa Koolpals eh, pero ilang months or years na ata yung lumipas nung nangyari yung singitan issue tapos nung na bring up yung issue saka lang naging maingay pangalan nila.

(filipinos are so indulged in issues and dramas, gstong gsto ng mga pinoy yan)

as much as i dont want to judge you OP pero parang hindi ka naman 13yrs na fan ng TM. 🙂 i can sense it.

di mo nga namention yung struggles nila during pre and post pandemic days.

bago magka pandemic, halos ""walang"" nakikinig sa kanila.

alam mo kung pano ko alam? ive been a member of their official FB tanyakis fan group at iilan lang kaming nandun. this was the year around 2017-2019. (pero ive been a Tanya guy during their Linda era pa around year 2010)

yung album nilang Mister Tililing na nagmamakaawa pa sila sa mga live guestings nila na bumili ng album yung mga tao (pero syempre joke lang nila yun)

yung songs nila na, Iglap at Stranded, singles pa lang yun sa spotify dati, halos kakaunti lang ang hits non, around 10k lang.

like you, i also question myself that time na bakit kaya walang nakakaappreciate ng mga songs nila eh sobrang gaganda (well iba iba kc preference talaga).

kung pwede ko nga lang sila i-gatekeep noon, kaso naisip ko, kelangan pa nila ng exposure para mas lalo silang makilala ng tao.

may time pa nga ata na parang hindi na sila talaga active, nagiisip pa ko non na, hala baka nagdecide na sila mag disband.

Anyway..

Its just cringe nowadays that some people label themselves as solid Tanyakis (dont mean to offend you OP pero parang belong ka dun, peace) pero hindi mo makitaan ng pagiging ""solido"" sa mga statements nila.

at least acknowledge Harlons (Norma Love) contribution sa banda diba kahit wala na siya ngayon sa kanila.

tandaan mo na isa si Harlon sa composer sa mga pinakikinggan nyo sa kanila.

at dun, mas macoconsider ko pa talaga na solido ka OP or kayo sa pagiging panatiko nyo.

kaso puro Iwa appreciation post lang nabasa ko sayo.

tandaan nyo na ang pagiging panatiko minsan nagiging toxic na yan and im not being like that by saying this, its just the truth.

so quit labeling yourselves kasi ang cringe talaga.

sometimes yan nga yung ayaw ng mga members mismo ng isang banda eh. yung mga ""pretentious"" pero pag nalaos na sila, wala na yung suporta (although sabi nga ni Iwa, hindi malalaos ang hindi sikat"").

Lastly, i wish na hindi ka na offend sa mga sinabi ko pero halata naman na nag eenjoy ka ""sa ngayon"" sa kanila. I hope you stay like that until their disbandment. Yun lang."

To basically explain what’s occurring here. This photo shows our “Forge” system we use to display our manifest and mapping directly linked with FedEx systems from our dispatch point “terminals”. Often, many contractors utilize third party routing systems on iPads/Tablets that simplify and provide good information for the driver. The driver probably is old school or the contract doesn’t afford for the routing systems. Now to explain the problem.
Essentially you could live at 
Ex: 12 Happy St, Cleveland, AL 35049
However, a new sub division with a house address
Ex: 19 Happy Rd, Cleveland, AL 35049 is ordering too. Then the system used in the evenings for route setup called DRO doesn’t know that this new road has a different name. St/Rd/Pl/Ct/Cv/Etc. 
so then the package is sent to the truck it thinks it belongs on, midday the driver gets to “your” stop. We are prompted with the screen that you see in the picture, thankfully the coordinates of your plot are local information that’s tied into are scanners GPS system so it calls it out. I have about 2-15 boxes a day that I have to essentially catch before I leave in the mornings and manually get them 
properly re-routed to the correct truck. However this can be a nightmare given a contractor is free to use whatever slot with whatever truck with whatever route so the designated area is hard to find sometimes and the only way of knowing is through word of mouth in the literal hell that occurs in the mornings. During this time of year these occurrences will spike drastically given drivers areas and routes are wildly changing right now and we have so many green drivers that generally 15% are worth their weight. All I can tell you is hope your driver is an intuitive driven guy and your issue should resolve. Until then the main FedEx manifesting system probably containing anywhere from 40k-75k packages a day this time of year needs to get a big area update to account for all new developments and declared addresses. I don’t know the time frame on this I’ve been a driver for 3 years and mine have sat in the same spots as they always do. Sorry this was an unload, hopefully you can understand the sheer clusterf*#k of how our job is setup. Us good guys try to keep the boat afloat but we hire anything that walks so it’s rough out here."

Some different causes; ear infections, head injuries. One time I scratched my drum while cleaning with a metal ear tool, but mostly from too many concerts without ear plugs.

I have successfully eliminated/healed tinnitus for myself more than once. 

I was admittedly desperate and wanted to try anything that might help. I did innumerable amounts of reading and then many hours of planning to develop a comprehensive protocol for myself. I cross-referenced everything to be sure I was getting the most out of everything and wasn't going to harm myself.

I feel strongly, experientially, that it was because of my comprehensive approach with a broad combination of intentional efforts and focus. I gave my body everything I could to aid in healing and neurogenesis while protecting it from further damage and providing the best possible circumstances and conditions to facilitate all of that.

Caveats:
I obviously can't say without a doubt, empirically, which of these helped, which didn't, if all of them did, or if it was simply time and my body's own healing... 
Several of these have limited evidence, on which more research is necessary to prove conclusively one way or the other... 

--Here's a list--

****Note 1: Almost everything here are things I was/am doing to support various aspects of my life anyway. ADHD, Depression, Weight Loss, Weight Training, Improve Work Performance, General Health and Vitality.

****Note 2:read up on each on your own. They have specific mechanisms which apply directly. I'm happy to discuss or offer further input, I just don't have time to explain it all when we have Google.)

**Supplements & Diet:
****Note: Read up to find optimal sources and protocols for you. Know what you're putting into your body and how they work, how they work together/against one another, and modifying variables. Don't over-do them. Talk to your doctor, I'm not a medical professional.

This first group of supplements specifically, directly for tinnitus: I take these together, on a specific protocol, with lemonade [sometimes + orange juice] including grated lemon zest, and with just enough food to avoid stomach discomfort:
- tinnitus vitamins (lipoflavinoid or generic)
- zinc (picolinate and/or bisglycinate)
- magnesium l-threonate
- gingko biloba
- lion's mane
- psilocybin
- niacin (flushing)
- vitamin c
- vitamin b-complex (methylated)
_________
- coQ10
- Vitamin E
- Phosphatidylcholine
- Phosphatidylserine
- Taurine
- 5hTP **if not on ssris** (take at bedtime)
_________

- bioflavonoid-rich foods, esp lemons + lemon zest
- choline-rich foods and supplements (eggs)
- citrulline-rich foods and supplements (beets, watermelon)
- antioxidant-rich foods and supplements (reds and greens)
- omega-3-rich foods and supplements
- tart cherries/juice for the natural melatonin
- fresh meat
__________
- stop caffeine
- stop nicotine
- reduce/stop stimulant medications if possible

However, there are discounts a plenty on EVs now where there are a great many EVs that are in price parity either with ICE equivalents or similar models available from competitors. Some makers like VW are going nuts (£60k for what is, in essence, an electric Passat is insane) but the Stellantis EVs level peg their ICE equivalents either at list or with discounts, the Korean EVs are close enough to be in contention, the chinese are dirt cheap in general. The German brands IMO have massively dropped the ball as cost is too high - but if you consider Tesla or Polestar, they are similar prices to German ICE saloons. Cost parity is much closer than you think.

Depreciation *is* a concern but so it ever has been. It's hard to generalise that depreciation specifically for EVs is terrible as I can cite ICE examples that are also bad but I do accept that it tends to hit cars with inflated prices more heavily - IE EVs. Ultimately I don't think anyone buys a new car as an investment as doing so is foolish. I accept that I'm ""losing"" money on the monthly payment for the convenience of not having a used car breaking on me - I am, unfortunately, not someone whose had good luck with anything older than 3 years old, hah!

The main area I disagree is the long distance driving. It *may* require a behaviour change if you're the sort of person that has historically driven 5 hours on the trot to your destination but I argue that is a good change. The highway code recommends stopping every 2 hours for 15 or so minutes - and I gently suggest that most folk are not aware of themselves getting tired, losing concentration when they don't. That is a general opinion of course and there'll be plenty who go ""no thanks I'm fine"" - up to them of course, but IMO they should be stopping more frequently. I have, once, had a 3 minute wait for a charger at Cobham services on the M27 on a bank holiday saturday at lunch time - otherwise I simply have never waited, across the entire length of the country. I have a fairly short ranged EV too so I've visited quite a few places! All of this is very anecdotal but it feeds into the opinion that the charging issue is often overdramatised and it is getting better all the time.

No one is saying it's right for everyone. There's use cases that simply don't work well (towing for example) but it's a good fit for vastly more people if they actually sat down and thought about their driving usage. Moreover if you're used to fairly humdrum cars like I am, electrification makes that experience an order of magnitude nicer. It's smoother, faster, quieter...generally much more pleasant than ICE models of similar size and cost. I think you wouldnt notice as much improvement if you're used to premium stuff perhaps, who knows."

I come from a Political family.  My mother was involved in state politics her entire life as a Democrat.  I did my internship with the Attorney General and spent a lot of time with the people who aspire to be politicians.

Politicians to me are people who aspire to be in politics.  They are a different breed. If you listen to conversations from people who moved into Politics in the past few years, you hear how the day they were sworn in, the vultures walked into their office to see how they could control their vote/mind f*ck them.  Similar to how new prisoners are taken under the wing of existing inmates and taken advantage of.  It’s impossible to rise against because the numbers will push out your will to stand against the tide.

They would have been identified during the audit undertook by 3rd party appointed by INEOS after their investment. 

Some of the changes identified in that audit will have been enacted overnight (removing credit card was early in), some will have been short to medium term (the redundancies needed some planning and time to roll out in part because of consultation periods and so on), others will have been queued at some time in the future when a financial obligation or agreement ends and will be renegotiated or ended (fergies ambassadorial role will end at the end of current season, and I’d guess the news of charity cuts now is because we had already committed to a contribution in 2024 and now as we tick into 2025 it’s time re recommit / reassess)

Some of the moves are terrible from a PR perspective especially when it’s being dripped by media in current fashion. I have sympathy for any staff, foundations affected, I really do but it’s not surprising. We are essentially a distressed business with huge levels of debt, and losing money at a fast rate

Trying to unwind 18years of absolute mismanagement that have left us crippled by debt requires some very unpopular decisions

These are horrible things to happen, reducing charity contributions, take staff perks, make redundancies and so on, but everyone should be very clear these decisions are a consequence of glazer ownership and club hemorrhaging money through their enforced club debt and overall mismanagement

I don't really see a lot of leftists in UFO communities. I also think that many people who voted for Trump believe that he will disclose things about UFOs.


So. What if Trump and his trillionaire spaceboy boss Elon have cooked most or all of this up to solidify their support in the face of a divided, angry country? What if Trump has been getting grief for his cabinet appointments, his plans to destroy the economy via launching tarrifs, invading Canada, and deporting millions of workers, and his recent admission that he won't be able to lower grocery prices just with his presence? 


Maybe he hopes that if he and tech-genius Elon create this ""drone"" mystery, his base will love/excuse him when Trump comes to power and solves it?


Also, a new conspiracy freaking out Qanon right now is the ""left's plan"" to attack and murder their Trumpy neighbors on inauguration day. People are advising each other to get their guns ready and ""greyrock"" their houses so no one will suspect that a real American lives there.


Maybe Trump and Co think that no one will dare do this if everyone is worried about ""drones."" And by making Biden look impotent (which Biden for sure does), it undermines the global cabal that props him up and demoralizes his Antifa minions. 


Even if it somehow came out that there were huge election irregularities, even if Putin invaded Poland right now,  even if Trump knows he's weeks away from being exposed as a hapless dumbass... no one will stand with Biden's crew after this drone debacle. No one will give Trump the boot if we hope he can, and will, at least explain what the hell is happening.


Me though? I'm on team alien.


TLDR; What if this is all just clumsy space insurance for Trump?"

In 1919, the Ottoman Empire had just been defeated for good, with most of its territory being held as mandates by the Allied Powers. However, what to do with the remaining territory of Anatolia was up in the air- Greece claimed that Constantinople and the Aegean Coast belonged to them, but Britain wanted to assure control over the Straits of Bosporus (so probably not in the hands of a minor power). The Kingdom of Greece decided to take matters into their own hands and pushed into Anatolia, beginning the Greco-Turkish war of 1919-1922. 

The Greeks appeared to be winning until the death of King Alexander from sepsis after being bitten by a monkey. The Greek government fell into disarray, with some factions even promoting disengagement from Anatolia. At this point the Turks began to push back, forcing the Greek armies out of Anatolia. To this day, the Republic of Turkey has been in control of Constantinople, now named Istanbul, and the Aegean Coast. The Greeks were so furious that they proceeded to overthrow their monarchy and proclaim the Second Hellenic Republic, which would last until the monarchy was restored in 1935.

The comment was deleted, evidently by the author, while I was typing it, so I am posting it as a top-level comment instead.)

> Honestly, Israel is just a country like Jordan and Turkey. There's nothing special about it. Idolising a modern secular country as GOD or even worshipping it is too stupid.

I agree with this and with everything else you say after it. Catholics should treat Israel like any other country engaged in war.

The Pope still seems obviously wrong. The remarks that drew the Israeli rebuke appear to have been Pope Francis's statement that, ""Yesterday, children were bombed (...) This is cruelty, not war."" On its face, this is a dumb thing to say. Children are *unavoidably* bombed in war; that is why war is so terrible and evil and devoutly to be avoided. (I cannot find a transcript of the Holy Father's full statement; perhaps he added more context that made it less stupid.)

Just war theory asks far more detailed questions: were children *targeted*, were they foreseen but unanticipated collateral damage, or were they victims of a pure accident? The first is always immoral. The second is justified if deaths are minimized in pursuit of a proportionate military objective. The third is acceptable as long as the attackers acted without reckless disregard for civilian casualties. Too, the threshold for attacking civilian areas is lower when a legitimate target fights out of uniform and embeds itself in civilian areas. In such cases, the moral responsibility for the higher civilian casualty rate falls on the party using human shields, not the party attacking them.

Of course, if the Pope were adopting a pacifist position, that might make sense. It is easy to find pacifism *very* attractive when faced with the full horror of war and the bloodless, barely-human moral calculus I just described. Certainly Christ Himself says many things that point toward pacifism. However, the contrast the Holy Father draws between ""cruelty"" and ""war"" show that he isn't aiming at pacifism at all. Pope Francis is pointing us back toward the just war framework, under which the attack must be evaluated based on specific facts.

Now consider what we know about the attack the Pope was condemning. According to Hamas, the attack killed 10 people, including seven children, all from the same family (the [Khallah family](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/21/israel-kills-7-children-from-one-family-in-air-strike-on-gaza), the oldest of whom was six years old. (For this to be true, Mrs. Khallah would have to have given birth to an average of more than one child per year, every year, for the past seven years. This is possible, especially with twins, but worth noting as we consider where to apply our skepticism.) The IDF says that Hamas is lying: ""the reported number of casualties resulting from the strike does not align with the information held by the IDF."" However, Israel does not elaborate on the details, inviting skepticism of its own. 

Why did the IDF launch this attack? According to Israel, ""several terrorists... were operating in a military structure belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation and posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the area,"" and the attack was intended to kill them. On its face, this seems plausible. After all, there are plenty of Hamas fighters still in Gaza fighting this war, and -- by the grotesquely bloody standards of modern urban warfare -- Israel has been remarkably precise about killing them. If Israel were acting indiscriminately, civilian casualties would be ten times higher, easily, and this seems borne out by statistics from other modern urban guereilla wars.

Given these facts, I cannot say for sure whether this strike is justified. This is doubly true because we cannot trust *either* Hamas's claims or the IDF's claims; both are military organizations inclined to lie for propaganda value, and there have been plenty of provable lies told during this conflict. It is possible the IDF killed this whole family on purpose as revenge just because the pater familias once said something nice about Hamas and Israel heard about it. It is also possible the IDF killed several active Hamas fighters and *zero* children. (Hamas has been caught staging videos of fake child deaths.) It is more likely the truth is somewhere in between. We simply don't have enough facts to judge whether this attack was ""war or cruelty.""

Neither does the Pope. Unless he has special Vatican military intelligence units embedded in the IDF, the Holy Father is talking out of his rear end and *should* be rebuked for his ungrounded and poorly-reasoned condemnation of this strike."

Both characters played the role as it was envisioned perfectly. (Interestingly, Eisenberg was a backup choice. Adam Driver was the original choice for Lex.)

It boils down to ""I don't like the character that was written. I imagined a completely different character."" It's often tied with fans of source material being obnoxious about ""muh source material"". This is one of the perils of adaptation PR-wise but it has nothing to do with bad casting. Heaps of movies have characters who are nothing like their namesakes. Star-Lord in GOTG in the films is nothing like his comic version. The same goes for most GOTG characters. This is normal. People weren't crying about how miscast everyone was because they didn't have an emotional attachment to how they ""should"" be. A character is miscast if they don't fit the role in the film. Resembling source material is irrelevant.

In the film Batman v Superman, especially in the director's cut, Lex Luthor is an unvarnished vision of a tech-bro. A weaselly little shit who can't handle being told no. One of the key scenes in the film, which the OP has screenshotted is him dropping his ""oh shucks"" mask because a woman dared to tell him he couldn't have something.

His Lex is an intelligent young man who believes that everyone else is as morally depraved as him. A common trait in tech-bros is a lack of basic moral standards. They don't believe anyone else has genuine beliefs or principles or any of that. All that matters is winning. And if winning means burning the world down, so be it.

As Lex seethes in the director's cut, *""I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOSE!""*

I think it's unfortunate that Eisenberg had his career hurt because of the role. I think he gave a fantastic performance that has aged very well. Also, despite what some people claim he has crystal clear motivations for doing what he does.

>*The problem of you on top of everything else. You above all. Ah. 'Cause that's what God is. Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El. Clark Joseph Kent. See, what we call God depends upon our tribe, Clark Jo, because God is tribal. God take sides. No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from Daddy's fist and abominations. Mm-mm. I've figured it out way back, if God is all powerful, He cannot be all good. And if He's all good then He cannot be all powerful. And neither can you be. They need to see the fraud you are. With their eyes. The blood on your hands.*

Most complains about this character boil down to ""I don't like it because it's different to what I wanted."" The idea that Eisenberg is miscast as a sniveling, cowardly, morally bankrupt tech-bro is very off the mark. An additional factor is that because the film is based on Excalibur, Lex represents the character Morgana. That's why he creates Doomsday (Mordred).

People on the internet often say they don't understand Lex's motivation. He gives a lecture that lasts several minutes explaining his motivations in detail. It's very simple. He was abused as a boy. ""No man in the sky saved me from daddy's fist and abominations."" So God is either all powerful or all good, and is likely all-powerful and evil, like Darkseid. (Hence his infatuation with Darkseid, who fits his idea of what God should be.) So he does very evil things for power. Then along come Superman who seems to be all-good, and all-powerful. There seems to be nothing he can't do. Lex cannot cope with this so he schemes to ""expose"" Superman as a murderous fraud by creating a situation where he will be forced to murder Batman in cold blood.

When you look at Elon Musk and how petty and vindictive he is and how he hides it behind a mask of being a cool, quirky guy with a great sense of ""humour"", Eisenberg's Lex feels prescient. The MCU version of Iron Man is directly based on Elon Musk, and Tony Stark in the Iron Man films is portrayed as someone cool and aspirational. Eisenberg's Lex is who Elon Stark really is."

>You make a few demo units (like they did for the fall event), give it standard FSD + a teleoperator to watch every move. So... 50%.

I mean, I can't fault you when you've already been candid that you've pulled the number out of your ass, but it seems strange you're now reiterating it.

The idea of waiting until marriage is often rooted in personal, cultural, or religious beliefs, and it’s definitely not for everyone.

The key is to find what works for you. If you believe that having a strong sexual connection is important for a healthy relationship, then it makes sense to want to explore that before making a lifelong commitment. At the same time, the idea of waiting until marriage to be sure a man is serious can come from a place of wanting to establish a deep emotional bond and trust before physical intimacy.

It’s important to communicate your values, needs, and boundaries with your partner early on. If a potential partner values waiting until marriage and you're not comfortable with that, it’s a signal that you may not be on the same page when it comes to fundamental aspects of the relationship. Finding someone who aligns with your values and who is also respectful of your feelings is key.."

4,2024-12-04,u/TearsOfTomorrowYT,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicSeven/comments/1h6c2cm/rta/m0cuwzu/,"There are units in this game that are specifically designed to dominate PvP competition. So if you go to RTA, obviously people are going to be playing nothing but those units.


So unless you have those same units yourself, there is really no point in trying RTA. Also because we're now in the late phase of the season, when the special skin you can win by achieving high rank has been revealed.


Why is that a problem? Because a lot of people with champion-level rosters are not obsessed with RTA like Emperor-level players are, and only start doing RTA after the skin is announced. Meaning, that if you take your silver-level roster and do your ranking matches at the very start of the season you will mostly find other silver-level players, but if you do your ranking matches now all you will find are these champion-level players who are just now starting their grind for the skin, and they have a lot of meta units so obviously they're gonna steamroll you.


That's why I keep telling people, that doing your ranking matches at the very start of the season, quickly achieving Master even with a shaky winrate, and then doing a game every 3 days to retain the rank until the season ends, is a SIGNIFICANTLY easier and more comfortable experience than trying to grind RTA after the skin is revealed. Because at the start of the season you're likely to face people of your rank who actually belong in your rank, while at the end of the season you're likely to face people who're only in your rank because they started the grind late, but have rosters that belong in champion, and you don't stand a chance against them."

Most misdemeanors are not very much work. The offers are often standardized and not heavily negotiated. I can do most misdo trials in my sleep. Attorneys absolutely can and do overwork these cases and wonder why they cannot survive in private practice or in court appointed. 

Shoplifting - reviews security video. Review statements made by defendant. Half day trial. 

Suspended driving - were they driving, were they suspended. Half day trial 

Non-dv fight. Review security video. See if you can use self defense. See if you can nullify. Look at photos of bruising. Half day trial.

DV - play chicken with prosecutor, review defendant statements. Get recantation if victim turns on state. Listen to 911 call. Half day trial. 

OWI/DUI - check for motions to suppress. Review body cam to see how bad defendant looks. Day trial. 

Drug - check for motions to suppress. See if you can point blame at anyone else. Half day trial 

Resist - watch body cam. If good for you, email DA if they really want this video shown to the public. If bad, plea. Half day trial

The biggest ones to avoid are the mentally ill misdos where you are gonna get stuck in a competency proceeding for months. Disorderlies and trespass. And stay away from neighbor disputes. 

You can absolutely, and ethically, do a solid job on these and while running a lot. Especially if you can tell your clients no when they want you to do a wild goose chase. You need to be focusing on one court house and combining as many appearances as possible. Great offers role in once the state knows you will go to trial on dumb misdos. 

To be completely real. More time needs to be taken on felony PV defense, not misdos. That’s the area where attorneys don’t take it seriously and they absolutely should."

As long as the US has this two party system, many voters are forced to choose between what they feel is the lesser of two evils.

So they get the votes of folks who would rather someone like Bernie Sanders be in charge but don't stand a chance of winning a general election because there aren't enough of us.

And there's nothing wrong with making money if people are interested in buying stuff with your brand on it.

They? Well I could mean people too stupid to understand that Trump is dangerous to democracy and so they voted for him 

Or

It could be because that is how the English language works when I am replying to a person who replied to you but referencing you.

What pronoun were you expecting me to use when talking to somebody about somebody else? I could have said he or she or it? Just let me know what your preferred pronouns are and we can go that direction.


>And of course, 2 things can be correct, he can have committed a crime (20 years ago mind you) and they can use that for politically motivated reasons

No, that's called Justice, and justice is something that you people do not understand. 

The reason you look at Justice and see it as politically motivated is because you think everybody in the world is just like you and would behave just as badly as you would given the opportunity.  You can't comprehend people acting in a moral way and wanting Justice for crimes committed. 

>You don’t have to be some blind trump fanatic to be reasonable in your estimation? 

Nobody that voted for Trump is reasonable in any way. Otherwise they would not have voted for somebody who is blatantly racist and has a history of sexual assault as well as 34 fraud felonies. 

Old school Republicans would all agree that you have betrayed our country and what it stands for. As a matter of fact, many of them have tried to tell you that and you call them RINO's. You stick your fingers in your ears and yell ""lalalala I can't hear you"" because you don't want to know the truth. 

The truth is nobody from The party of law and order and morals would have ever elected Trump. You have sold your soul but don't understand it


>I didn’t even think what I said was that controversial but clearly people are triggered lol

I'm sure you didn't, That's kind of the problem that you are incapable of understanding how anybody else thinks.

 If Tesla hadn't opened up to other vehicles, they would have missed out on a great deal of government funding. Worse (from their perspective), they would probably have started to face increased competition, potentially from corporations that could put the resources behind the effort to do it well.

As the margins on their vehicles dropped and the number of EVs increased, someone at Tesla realized that the supercharging network might turn into a very large and profitable revenue stream."

What I originally wanted to say is that this reflects a very peculiar system in K-pop overall—they operate on the idea of “invest first, earn later,” meaning idols need to pay back all the costs before they can start making any profit. As for working hours, if you calculate based on hours worked, many South Korean idols are earning far below the minimum wage.

The most profitable income sources for idols are concerts and album sales. Since the Vegas concert belonged to TWICE, I believe VCHA’s share of the profits from it must be very small. On top of that, there are the costs associated with producing the survival show. So, under this absurd system, it’s not surprising that they’re earning so little right now.

But again, I do not agree with this system. I’m just trying to express that this issue isn’t exclusive to VCHA. As KG said, it’s a problem with the entire K-pop industry."

I also did a big road trip from Reno to Phoenix. It was 12 hours of sctual driving and 2 hours of charging. We used the charging stops to pee, stretch legs, get lunch. Or coffee. I probably would have stopped half as often if I had an efficient gas car, but it wasn't awful to get a little break from driving.

Bad drivers - yeah just turn on FSD and let is handle it. (As a quicksilver Tesla driver, I agree that the basic white Teslas tend to have worse drivers. They didn't spend the extra cash for a better color and they likely didn't spend the money for FSD, so it's actually them driving lol.

No sounds - Tesla can replace the horn and blinker with a fart sound. You can also make it farther remotely via the app with sentry mode on. What more does a man need?"

I think people vastly underestimate just how goddamn miserable pregnancy is. I have had three relatively uneventful, peaceful, and healthy pregnancies. My deliveries have all been normal too. Really no complications to speak of. I’m 6 months PP with my third and last and I am back to my normal adult body weight that I’ve been since I was in my early 20s. Sufficient to say, my pregnancy history would probably be considered optimal circumstances by most people. 

And I fucking loathed it. Particularly my last pregnancy although each one had its shittiness. 

First off, morning sickness is not a fucking joke. While I generally had better experiences with my second and third pregnancies, I had awful nausea with my first. Like, *my husband drove into our driveway too fast and bumped the curb so I vomited* nausea. My body would randomly reject different food with no real rhyme or reason. 

About the time you clear the nausea, the kicking begins. And at first, it’s magical and adorable and amazing. And then it’s fucking 2am and the little bastard will not stop kicking your ribs as you flinch in pain. Later, it’s your bladder. You’ll get kicked so hard you’ll swear your water broke. Nope, you just peed yourself without realizing it. True story. 

Your body is just wonky as shit for the majority of the last trimester. Some days you’ll feel relatively normal. Other days you won’t want to get off the couch. My god do you ache like you’ve never ached before for the last four weeks. This bowling ball will sit so low in your pelvis, you’ll swear you could sneeze him or her out, only to be told you haven’t dilated at all. 

And then you’ll just be minding your business one day and all of the sudden start a marathon of pain endurance that is out of this fucking world. Sure, you can take drugs to numb it. They might work. Odds are you’ll have to endure at least some of it before you’ll be admitted. Me, I chose natural the second and third pregnancies because the epidural really screwed up my ability to push for my first. If you’re lucky, labor will be a few hours. Or maybe a few days. I at one point was screaming that I was going to die. 

Fast forward a bit and you’ve birthed your baby. You now to get have a mega period for the next month and hopefully don’t pee or poop yourself. It’ll sting like hell every time you pee for at least a week. Better take some stool softener because you will dread that first poop. You’ll be exhausted but not able to sit correctly because of the watermelon you shoved out of your pelvis. 

Oh you had a c-section? Not my experience but that’s no walk in the park either. You had major abdominal surgery. Best case scenario, you’re recovering for the next six weeks. A few people I know dealt with their incisions reopening UP TO NINE MONTHS POSTPARTUM. 


…I skipped the good part though. You go through this absolute trial of pain and misery and then all of the sudden you’ve birthed this perfect little human. The love I felt when I had each of my babies can still bring me tears. It is euphoria. I’d relive those days again, pain and all, just to experience that again. So I can’t even imagine going through all of that just to hand the baby over. God bless those that do, it’s a hell of a sacrifice. A million is a lot of money but I’m not set for life because of it. That’s the kind of money I’d need to consider going through it again— and even then, I’d only consider it specifically because I’ve already had babies and at this point am otherwise done having babies. It is not something I’d tell any first time parent to do— and I totally understand why most surrogacies won’t allow them to."

3,2024-12-22,u/Game_Sappy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1hjtous/why_does_it_feel_like_every_non_traumatized/m3chvah/,"I related to what you said here on huge levels, age 18-22 I was feeling the exact same pain you're describing and felt like I was unable to relate to any other human being.  The ones I asked for help just told me things like 'I get it bro, I'm shy too bro, you just gotta have courage and snap out of it bro, I'll be your wingman and help you hook up bro'.  Now I'm in a place where I can laugh at those idiots and their bollocks advice, but throughout my early 20's I actually would try to follow it, and as a result I would go back and forth from forcing myself to be social and then have mental breakdowns while banging my head on concrete walls, blinding myself with concussions behind locked doors when their 'advice' wasn't working.  Being around others actually made me feel infinitely more lonely, because I found myself hopelessly, utterly unable to relate to any other human being.

Eventually I realised that forcing myself to find belonging was actually making everything much worse and gave up on it.  I let it go, stopped trying, and isolated myself, complete Zen.  As you can imagine, the bullshit choir was against that too, saying things like 'isolation is unhealthy' etc etc.  But in my late 20's to age 30 that's what I did.  I killed all my social media, cut off anyone whom I didn't consider a true friend, stopped answering calls from family esp. the fucked-up monsters that were my parents, and focused inwards only on myself.  It was my moment of peace.  It allowed me to whittle down the causes of why I felt the way I felt.  It also saved me from being headhunted and groomed by various extremists who are looking for emotionally vulnerable unemployed deadbeats to exploit and brand with their twisted ideologies and cult mentality.  It allowed me to see the world from a skyscraper perspective and more or less reframe and re-strategise my entire life.  It allowed me to find out more about myself, discover who I am both in terms of substance as well as personality, I discovered the MBTI personality test and typed 'INTJ' (Introverted Intuitive Thinker Judger) among other such personality and strengths-based profiling and it answered a lot of the questions I had about why I perceive existence the way I do, which helped me carve out a place in the world for myself, at a time when I felt like I didn't belong in the world at all.

Most importantly and perhaps ironically, it allowed me to accept and let go of my desire to belong and relate to others.  I filled the hole with self-care and focusing on the things that gave my life meaning, like heavy metal music and oil painting and violent RPG video games that were more therapeutic (and cheaper) than any therapist I've ever seen in my life (we're talking double digits).  I even found a warehouse job that required minimal interaction with others when earlier I couldn't hold down a job at all.

I'm in my 30's now and have very little of substance to show for it, but at the very least I'm proud of how far I've come along in healing and feel like I've pieced together something resembling a foundation that people who grew up without trauma have when it comes to interpersonal relationships.  I'm coming out of my isolation with new skills and healthier perspectives with a fuller and more stable sense-of-self, and the new people I'm meeting are actually, ironically, even more lost and messed up than I was, even if they haven't gone through any kind of trauma.  My popularity with the opposite sex even went up, whereas before I more or less lived as a sexually frustrated incel.  You'd be surprised how attractive healing makes you, because that healing energy might actually be what others need as well, since you and I sure as hell aren't the only traumatised people on the planet, with all the wars and mass-murder happening in the world today and that's been happening for the last 2 million years.

And for the record, it is not easy.  It's the hardest thing I've ever done and the hardest thing you'll ever do too.  It's the hardest thing probably anyone on the same block or within a 1km radius will do.  But letting go of being desperate for belonging and isolating myself helped me find my own light.  When you cannot find a light to follow, it probably means that your place in the world and your destiny is to be a light for others to follow."

It was such a PITA to go to the office or another classroom to ask to have the custodian paged every single time to let me back in. And when I had an entire class of kids with me (picking up from recess or gym, etc.) I then had to send a kid to go ask for someone to be paged.

Never went back to that school again."

\- Their arch enemies are genius leaders of influential crime organizations (James Moriarty and Souichi Kiruma), responsible for the biggest part of their field of practice (Moriarty organized half of all crimes in London and Hal is the leader of Kakerou, which manages most gambles Baku participates in), who were born into influential families with an insanely capable brain from the start, that allowed them to coordinate complex actions of their organizations from the shadows, staying completely unnoticed by the public.

\- These arch enemies try to be perfect as much as possible, to lead their organizations flawlessly (Sherlock stated that Moriarty’s entire business is dependent on everything he does succeeding and Hal feels a strong need to be perfect, in order to be worthy of leading the referees).

\- Defeating them resembles their ultimate goals, they always tried to achieve (Sherlock states that defeating Moriarty would be achieving the highest possible goal for him with him working for years in uncovering the mysterious presence behind all the crimes in London, while winning Surpassing the Leader and thus defeating Hal is what Baku chases after throughout the entire series).

\- To do so, they slowly worked on taking them down step by step (Sherlock managed to pose a genuine threat to Moriarty‘s network by putting it in a very dangerous position close to collapsing over months, while Baku collected all the requirements to play Surpassing the Leader), which led to final confrontations (The Reichenbach Fall and Surpassing the Leader), where they both more or less died (Sherlock and Moriarty *supposedly* fell off the waterfall together, while Baku and Hal had died multiple times due to the near death drug).

\- Both had to deal with American criminal organizations (Ku Klux Klan and Ideal) associated with specific objects (Orange Pips and Diamonds), whose leaders (Captain James Calhoun and Vincent Lalo) managed to stay unnoticed, operating from the shadows for an impressive amount of time, until they targeted certain people (John Openshaw and Souichi Kiruma), which also got them their attention (Openshaw consulted Sherlock as a client and Lalo rivaled Baku for the right to play Surpassing the Leader).

\- These leaders managed to give them runs for their money and belong to the few people, who actually had them in the losing situation (Openshaw got killed despite Sherlock‘s effort to save him and Lalo had the advantage in Air Poker, which is why Baku had to make a ridiculous bet to win).

\- However, the leaders were still defeated in the end and drowned (Sherlock managed to defeat the Ku Klux Klan and had them in a practically unsolvable situation, with their imprisonment being almost certain, but their ship sank instead, while Lalo lost to Baku in Air Poker and drowned because of that).

\- Both also had to deal with the right hand men of the leaders of powerful crime syndicates, who were big physical threats and in leading positions in these syndicates only second to their leaders and commanding multiple actions, such as trying to directly kill them, for which they were prepared (Sebastian Moran, who was the second and command in Moriarty’s organization and the head of most businesses, tried to assassinate Sherlock in his apartment, which Sherlock anticipated and prepared a trap for, to let him be arrested by the police and Billy Craig, the right hand man of Lalo and co-leader of Ideal, who was organizing most of their actions up to Tower of Karma and tried to kill Baku, but was at first slowed down by the nim game, only to be threatened by Baku with a rifle).

\- Despite their impressive intellects, there are even greater ones, belonging to people who resemble them in some way and proved themselves to be superior in the past (Sherlock’s older brother Mycroft, who despite his much wider stature, does share some physical similarities with him, as well as an even better talent for solving mental tasks and Gonen, who once defeated Baku and won his heart, making him look insanely similar to him)."

And since we are pretty much alone here now, I'll try to clarify. 

Obviously, it is very wrong to use expressions like ""payola king"" or ""token chosen,"" or imply he is only successful because of collabs. 

But Jimin and JK are not on an equal playing field when it comes to company support and promotions. I know you all don't like to hear it, but it is a fact. JK had--continues to have--advantages others don't, particularly Jimin. I'll go through the list, if you like, but is that really necessary after all this time? 

So when JK biased-fans talk about the resounding success of Seven or SNTY and compare it to Jimin's --I know you weren't among those doing this, but others were--it feels unjust. 

And let me say for the record for the millionth time--NONE of that is JK's fault. That's on the company. Those who bias the other 6 BTS members need to remember that. I do. JK himself has done nothing wrong but pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a global pop star. Good luck to him. He's a talented performer, a good guy, and has the wisdom to choose Jimin as his best buddy. Why would anyone wish him ill? 

But for some unfathomable reason, JK stans have an almost desperate need to erase the unequal treatment and pretend it didn't happen. Or insist it was Jimin's preference (!?!) or whatever b.s. They can't blame the company because they perceive that's too close to blaming JK. 

They also--again, not you, but apparent in this thread and others--have a singular ambition of ensuring that JK is always the top dog. Why Jimin's underdog, come-from-behind, miraculous success is a threat, I don't know. Shouldn't they be more concerned with the other global pop stars? 

However, Jimin's popularity in the U.S. is a sore point. Because the U.S. is where JK was heavily promoted (compared to the other BTS members). This is where BangPD put the money and resources BTS made for him, and this is where he was thoroughly fleeced by Scooter. So yes, it feels like a very sweet victory to see Jimin doing well here. I'm sure JK feels the same and is happy for his squadron mate. BangPD? Not so much. 

Throughout these threads--again, not you--there are people subtly belittling Jimin's success; that it's all fan-based, mass streaming, bots, Moroccan streaming farms (???), etc., etc.,  And then there is the real hate and vitriol he gets from other k-pop stans, JK solos, and, God help us, Taekookers. 

For the life of me, I can't figure out why JK-biased fans/solos want to insist that he is equally hated--no, more so, *because look at all these downvotes!*\--but that's one competition I really don't want to be a part of, thank you very much. 

Have a good weekend!"

I still attend church every week, but I have chosen not to renew my temple recommend. I'll go ahead and rank the type of comments I heard on the other thread from least favorite to favorite, and add a commentary on my thoughts on those comments.

Least favorite: - ""I feel like we should do what we can to encourage each other to live the commandments."" Please, please don't do this. I know what is taught in General Conference and Sunday School, I don't need you to remind me or encourage me. Thank you.

""Don't judge them, even if they are wicked."" Yeah, I appreciate the effort, but tbh, that still feels a bit judgy. A subtle difference that would improve the sentiment would be to leave off the 2nd part, just leave it at ""Don't judge them.""

""I just mind my own business."" That's so much better than encouraging me to live the commandments, but in practice, it often feels like being ignored.

""If you see someone struggling, ask them how they are doing (church and religion aside)."" Great, I actually do love this. I don't consider myself to be struggling, but I appreciate people checking in on me and treating me as a person. I like this better than people minding their business/ignoring me.

""Have an honest conversation to understand where the person is coming from."" I didn't actually see this response on the other page, but this would be the best possible scenario. I know it would feel invasive to do that, but to me it would feel like love. I promise I'm not going to try and take away your faith or obedience, or convince you to believe what I believe. Part of my nuance is that we don't all need to believe the same things. But it would feel really great to be known and understood. This would be preferable to to people correcting me, minding their own business, or thinking I'm struggling and checking in on me. Just come connect with me and seek to understand me would be the best possible thing that you could do to help me continue coming to church and feeling like I belong there."

My experiences with drugs were mixed. While on the one hand they can open a world of pleasure, unconventional thinking and, for me, opened my perspective to a whole bunch of different ideas.
On the other I also struggled with addiction, poor mental health and got into a lot of less than ideal situations.

The Conjoined Twins – Two Bodies, One Life

Once, in a remote, decrepit village shrouded in dense, eternal fog, two conjoined twins were born into a world that recoiled at the sight of them. Their names were Leila and Daphne, and they shared one body but had two distinct minds. Where their form should have evoked sympathy, it instead stirred revulsion. The twins, though physically bound, were gentle souls who longed for acceptance and love. But their misshapen form branded them as monsters.

The villagers called them “The Wretched Pair,” spitting venomous vitriolic words and treating them as cursed beings. Leila, the more outspoken of the two, dreamed of proving their worth to the world. Daphne, the quieter one, secretly wished for beauty—the kind that might allow them to glide through life like the swans she watched on the village’s foggy lake. Their only solace was their mother, a kindhearted woman who fiercely defended them and told them that their true beauty lay within their hearts.

The Centennial Competition
When the Grand Centennial Competition—a test of skill, grace, and wit—was announced, Leila and Daphne saw their chance to escape their torment. The victors of the competition would be crowned royalty, ushered into a life of splendor and respect. For the twins, it was more than a contest; it was salvation.

But their dreams clashed with two rivals, Arden and Celeste, twin siblings renowned for their ethereal beauty and unmatched talent. Arden was a swordsman whose skill dazzled the audience, while Celeste’s eloquence and grace charmed all. They were everything Leila and Daphne admired yet despised, for they embodied the unattainable ideals the twins so desperately yearned for.

Despite working tirelessly—practicing dances that strained their conjoined form, crafting speeches that conveyed their raw, unfiltered humanity—Leila and Daphne faced sabotage at every turn. Villagers tripped them during their performances, destroyed their costumes, and laughed cruelly when they stumbled. The final humiliation came when Arden and Celeste were crowned victors. 

As the crowd roared for the siblings, Leila and Daphne stood in the shadows, their hearts shattered.
The twins begged the villagers for a second chance, pleading for fairness, but they were met with jeers. Even Arden and Celeste, who had once treated them with fleeting kindness, looked at them with pity rather than respect.

The Birth of Ambition and Despair
The hatred of the world festered in their hearts, warping their dreams into something darker. They no longer wished to prove their worth; they wanted vengeance. Yet, beneath their envy, a twisted admiration still burned. 

They envied Arden and Celeste not just for their beauty but for the love and admiration they commanded. This envy became an obsession, and they longed to become the embodiment of elegance and grace—the swan they had idolized as children.

It was during this time of despair that they discovered the Behelit, a crimson, otherworldly artifact their mother had hidden away. The twins were unaware of its true nature, but the Behelit seemed to whisper to them in their dreams, promising them a way to escape their suffering. 

One stormy night, as their desperation peaked, they activated the Behelit, unwittingly summoning the God Hand.
The Ultimate Sacrifice
The God Hand appeared in a hellish vortex of screams and shadows, offering them a choice: sacrifice that which they loved most in exchange for transcendence. 

The twins hesitated, for their mother had been the only light in their darkness. But ambition consumed them. Leila, emboldened by rage, took the lead, convincing her sister that this was the only way. Together, they sacrificed their mother, hearing her agonized cries as her soul was consumed.
The transformation was immediate and horrific. 

Their twisted, conjoined form elongated and morphed, taking on the features of an elegant swan. Their legs became talons, their arms like dark feathers. But their faces—marked by their rivals—retained Arden and Celeste’s visages, which they had stolen as trophies during their ascension. These faces were not anatomical but grotesque effigies fused into their bosom, a reminder of the beauty they envied and destroyed.
In their new form, they renamed themselves Leda, after the myth of the swan. 

They became an Apostle driven by vengeance and twisted ideals of beauty, believing that through blood and terror, they could finally command the respect they had been denied.
The Madness Within
Though Leda reveled in their newfound power, they were far from whole. Their duality—once a source of love and unity—had become a chasm of madness. 

The faces of Arden and Celeste on their chest served as both their pride and their torment. They heard whispers from these faces, remnants of the personalities they had consumed. The trophies were symbolic but still haunted them, warping their sense of self.
Leda was no longer Leila or Daphne; they were a fractured being, oscillating between delusions of grandeur and the despair of forgotten humanity. 

They had sacrificed not just their mother but their own souls, forgetting the lesson she had tried to teach them: that beauty comes from within.

Thematic Parallels to Berserk
	•	Ambition and Sacrifice: Like many Apostles, Leda’s tragic fall stems from their ambition and willingness to sacrifice love for power. Their tale mirrors the overarching theme in Berserk of how unchecked ambition leads to corruption.
	•	Duality and Identity: Leda’s conjoined nature and their eventual fracturing symbolize the loss of identity. Their desire to become something beautiful destroys the very thing that made them unique.
	•	The Behelit’s Cruel Irony: The Behelit grants them their wish to become “elegant” but in a horrifying, monstrous way, consistent with how the God Hand manipulates human desires.

Weakness – The Faces of Pride
Leda’s grotesque trophies are also their greatest vulnerability. 

Damaging one of the faces on their chest causes them to become deliriously confused, as the whispers from the trophies grow louder and more erratic. Destroying both faces plunges Leda into an uncontrollable frenzy, a state of pure insanity where they lash out indiscriminately. 

This is because the faces symbolize the ideals they once envied and sought to embody, and their destruction forces Leda to confront the void of their own lost identity.
In these moments of frenzy, echoes of Leila and Daphne’s original personalities surface, revealing fleeting glimpses of the kind, hopeful twins they once were—now buried beneath layers of envy, rage, and despair."

I've been a Tesla Model 3 owner for a while now and noticed my brakes get squaky after a while.   It turns out Tesla asks owners to ""burnish"" their brakes when they notice this. This involves finding a safe road with little traffic on it, getting the caer up to a decent 35-50 MPH and pressing the brake pedal hard to burnish off accumulated gunk and rust from the surface of the rotors/pads arising from disuse. I've had to do it three times, and it resolves the issue quickly."

Tesla superchargers that predate that requirement exist, but new ones have payment terminals. They made it relatively painless to pay on the older ones using the app. 

In the early days of rapid charge operators they were trying to make everything app based (likely because using card terminals costs money in transaction fees), but legislation put a stop to that: they're allowed to have apps and discounts and membership schemes but they all must have credit card payment at the point of use, just like paying for gasoline. 

The problem with rapid charging sites are that they are often unmanned and outside which means all the payment and charging has to work automatically and needs to be robust and reliable which adds cost."

Republicans that owe their recently acquired mandate partly to the fact they were just the (R) down ballot from Trump were ready to let this go without a fight when twitter started complaining about it with Elon leading the charge. In response, the House trimmed it down by a significant amount to a little over 100 pages. Everything that was cut out was done so with zero input from Trump. Mike Johnson also needlessly went behind his parties back to make deals with Democrat leadership that achieved nothing but stalling the process further.

This entire fiasco is just a repeat of the same stupid shit Congress has been doing with these gigantic bills for decades now.

""By choice"" is only loosely true.  We're products of society and our circles, and environments.  *Systemic* issues have led to behavior and even *lifestyles* where people aren't curious.. because information of all kinds is dumped their laps.  

Of course people are going to go with their biases and will go with the most convenient things for them.  We're also slaves to algorithms, not really by choice, either, since we can't so much as sort our feeds the way we want, or stop them from refreshing automatically, and they're endless, unlike when they first appeared a decade ago.  We doomscroll constantly though habit.  Between that, AI, Google, etc., it's all literally rewiring our brains.  We can't just decide to stop one day because we depend on these things now for production and boredom.  

But you're right, because many of us are exposed to the same things, yet still manage to learn a thing or two to avoid stupidity like electing a felon.  We need to change things on a systemic level or we're fucked, because more and more people have fallen and will fall into the mis/dis/information abyss led by mind control of sorts, even those of us who finally gave up after this election on informative political news.

>Musk said he considers himself an environmentalist and added that it is important that, in the long run, industries reduce the billions of tons of carbon they take from the earth and release into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels.

I feel like I don't exist in the same plane of reality anymore with people, the world of alternative facts, you read one thing and take away what you want to hear regardless of the words on the page.

I disagree with the guy completely, but it's quite obvious what is being said, there's not even any particular interpretation needed. He is saying (in contrast to 98% of scientists) that global warming is a longer term problem and we don't need to move as fast off oil as some people claim, in the long term absolutely we do or the planet is doomed, but in the short term demonizing oil can cause more problems than it's worth. 

I hate hate hate that you people are making me defend Musk of all people over a statement that I find incredibly dangerous of all things. Just please let's exist in the word of facts and truth and stop making shit up because all it does it convince anyone who needs to convincing not to even pay attention seeing that it's untruthful.

''Oryx, my King, my friend. Kick back. Relax. Shrug off that armor, set down that blade. Roll your burdened shoulders and let down your guard. This is a place of life, a place of peace.

Out in the world we ask a simple, true question. A question like, can I kill you, can I rip your world apart? Tell me the truth. For if I don’t ask, someone will ask it of me.

And they call us evil. Evil! Evil means ‘socially maladaptive.’ We are adaptiveness itself.

Ah, Oryx, how do we explain it to them? The world is not built on the laws they love. Not on friendship, but on mutual interest. Not on peace, but on victory by any means. The universe is run by extinction, by extermination, by gamma-ray bursts burning up a thousand garden worlds, by howling singularities eating up infant suns. And if life is to live, if anything is to survive through the end of all things, it will live not by the smile but by the sword, not in a soft place but in a hard hell, not in the rotting bog of artificial paradise but in the cold hard self-verifying truth of that one ultimate arbiter, the only judge, the power that is its own metric and its own source—existence, at any cost. Strip away the lies and truces and delaying tactics they call ‘civilization’ and this is what remains, this beautiful shape.

The fate of everything is made like this, in the collision, the test of one praxis against another. This is how the world changes: one way meets a second way, and they discharge their weapons, they exchange their words and markets, they contest and in doing so they petition each other for the right to go on being something, instead of nothing. This is the universe figuring out what it should be in the end.

And it is majestic. Majestic. It is the only thing that can be true in and of itself.

And it is what I am.'' 

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/xxxii-majestic-majestic?highlight=Majesti

In unveiling it says this. 
""They're majestic, I said. They have no purpose except to subsume all other purposes. There is nothing at the center of them except the will to go on existing, to alter the game to suit their existence. They spare not one sliver of their totality for any other work. They are the end.""

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/the-final-shape?highlight=Majestic

""According to him, the visible world is a manifestation of eternal light and eternal darkness, and it is in eternal opposition that eternity has revealed itself. The fall was necessary for creation to escape its first imperfect stasis and seek a truer form. Heresy? Well, then, I am the heresiarch. The philosopher died of a bowel disease. Those who do not exist cannot suffer and are of no account to any viable ethics. If the true path to goodness is the elimination of suffering, then only those who must exist can be allowed to exist. It is the nature of life to favor existence over nonexistence, and to prefer the fertile soil to the poisoned wind. Because those who open their mouths to that wind pass from the world and leave no descendant, whether of flesh or of thought.""

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/pleased-to-meet-you#book-unveiling



""And from that self-evident truth, you must raise your eyes to the ultimate revelation: those who cannot sustain their own claim to existence belong to the same moral category as those who have never existed at all.

Existence is the first and truest proof of the right to exist. Those who cannot claim and hold existence do not deserve it. This is the true and only divination, a game whose losers are not just forgotten but are never born at all.

That which cannot claim and hold existence is not real. You do not mourn the unreal. Why should you care for it? Tend it? Guard it?""

Trust me when I say that I might not love you, but your succulent phallus magnificus saxis informibus Mexicano has my complete adoration, focus and it's the total desire of my heart and soul at this moment. Understand that right now my entire life is owned by your cock and especially this uncut moist pink head delicately being nursed on like a baby nursing on his bottle 🍼, you breathe deeply, please don't cum fast, this is my entire prayer 🙏. Above you own this throat. It's yours to use, and don't be afraid to use it. Try not to become fully hard, but relax and enjoy having it planted fully into this throat. Relax and breathe and slowly release it as you feel these throat muscles encompassing your beautiful cock. I will not let you or this cock, softly planted in my throat, down. As I mentioned for you to drink lots and lots of water all day, I brought you a liter of your favorite water. Drink some right now. It's just water. Can you feel my heart beating just below this pink head resting in my throat? Breathe and slowly release it, and release it again, and as you wet my throat, I feel it suckling away between each slow controlled release. Now you know what this throat is yours and how it loves your beautiful cock. You notice that every time I hold that small brown bottle to my face, you breathe deeply and slowly release it. At this moment, time is standing still. You look down and see your cock planted completely to your balls, it looks very good as my pink lips and white skin colour contrasting with the color of your cock. Allow my throat muscles to make love to it, breathe, and slowly release. It's complete adoration and worship. You can drink. You are in complete harmony with me and this throat. Everything in my world is focused on your beautiful Mexican Cock. I feel the warmth of your body temperature wetting my throat as these muscles are flexing as nursing in like a pig. At these moments, feeling your wet DNA filled precum and nectar flowing in this throat, it's as if the universe has gone in reverse and nothing else matters to me. Your big Mexican Cock is my purpose for being alive. My purpose was to give you a throat to become one with. I can smell your musky aroma, and you have been drinking the water as you relax playing your game 🎮. You know that after this, your cock will expect it every single time. Now you feel blood engulf your beautiful cock and the throat is slick with your precum, now we are in tandem. I prayed for an extremely multiple shooting load, so big and intense that I would choke if I didn't have it down atop my beating heart ♥️. There it is,you are blowing up into this throat muscles, nursing quickly, taking every single drop. You feel me going completely still. I am just holding your cock, pulsing. I know it's sensitive. But keep it planted in your pig's throat. Relax and breathe, take a long drink, and then another. Breathe in and relax, now you know what real cock worshipping is. Relax and slowly release as you wet my throat as the muscles are slowly nursing. 7 hours have passed and your cock and body is 100% drained. Your cock looks so good inside this masculine mouth."

Poor migrants, let's close our eyes on crimes they commit and how they feel about assimilation, because they grew up in place where counting women as objects and rape people of any age and gender considered normal, of course they will continue in their hosting country, due to lack of control and their feeling of belonging to the country, especially when those animals make up gangs, Sweden for example

If Europeans have basic understanding of what's good and bad, as well as education, affecting their mindset, Middle Asia and Africa lack of providing those features to their people, because of the corrupt government they had and have throughout their whole existence

How can black people positively affect the world if they always had wars with eachother, were slaves of the same kind, neighbouring tribes and arabs, or isolated themselves from everyone else? How can arabs positively affect the world if their government cared only about shiny things and making religion the core of people's mind, of course in their favour to keep their power strong and stable for as long as possible, cutting people's heads of if they were acting against the ""will of Allah"", what they practice even now

https://youtu.be/zSP1nRLdhtk?si=AY9pv8oFwAdSARkh

I think what has allowed FSD to progress so substantially is that they’re using an AI backend training on not only data from Tesla cars but thousands of thousands of hours of driving footage. 

Before my vehicle died and I bought a model Y my knowledge of teslas and FSD seemed to be rooted in what it was like years ago. It seems like people don’t have a working knowledge of what driving a Tesla is like—unless they personally drive a Tesla. 

Now take a look at Mercedes “level 3” autopilot, which people routinely bring up—https://youtu.be/xlc8EOtxKm8?si=CxYsEMTFsSIs6kH6

'Rotation' is basically Charge or Shoot ( Shoot if you need to pull mobs), hit bloodrage, Hit Battle Should, then Sunder 1-2 times the first mob then rotate through the mobs with Sunder, some people use Thunder Clap at this point but honestly it's pretty trash an rage is better spent elsewhere, Use Revenge when you can and hit Clevee / HS to rage dump and hit Taunt when youse lost rage on a mob, things change slightly when you get Sweeping Strikes, and Whirlwind but honestly you will be surprised how far just spamming Battleshout and Sundering can get you.

Remember to always Mark your Skull Mob ( first kill) and X Mob ( second kill) that way you can focus on those mobs for generating threats.

If you Charge you will need a Macro that puts you back into Defensive Stance so you don't have to do it manually each time.

A macro that puts a Shield and 1H on and then cast a Sheild Block or Shield Bash is IMO Vital as well, you should Tank with a 2H 90% of the time at lower levels because the Threat generation is better but it good to be able to switch  for Mobs/Boss that Hit extra hard, just communicate with your Healer and they will let you know if you should switch to a Shield.

Spec's are from the Talent tree, did you get to level 37 without spending your Talent points? Spells belong to different specs but you can use them all except for ones learnt by moving up the Talent tree.

Remember Tanks set the pace, if the group thinks you're going too slow then they can just leave and find another Tank lol."

The house belongs to the wife and hub together, they paid for it together also, is one party now ignoring wishes of the other to let ''anyone'' stay as they want without prior agreement. I don't even think it is just about the son anymore. 

If the hub now asks a friend to come over for 3 hr visit and the friend never leaves for 1 yr permanently, and wife is upset and saying no he has to go, but hub is saying just stay as long as u wish, i don't care what my wife thinks. in what way is that ok in a marriage? 

And moreever the person overstaying happens to be a son that the hub and wife has been arguing about since the son was 5 years old, soon 25 years of this, even if the son is wrong, the wife according to herself always will take the side of the son, over her hub. Resentment much u think?"

it only tastes ""gross"" if you conceptualize it that way. women tend to be a lot more concerned about their taste and smell, but i really think its more of a socialized perspective than the truth.

I think it’s interesting the trauma from PTSD, I could definitely see this occurring for many reasons. All the love and support for having gone through homelessness. For me I think it would be 

-Being faced with the constant judgment of the *average American human being*
-having a lack of personal space, privacy, quiet time, autonomy over one’s surroundings overall, for massive amounts of time 
-being faced with losing virtually every physical luxury of home (making the assumption that when going homeless, a person throws what they can into storage, IF they can, and then they forfeit what they can’t immediately take with them) and having to figure out how to do the basic necessities of human survival. Day in and day out, often times, in the middle of a big ass city where how many people would see you each day. 

I could definitely see myself fall into a dark place emotionally due to my hard circumstances I’m dealing with, combined with receiving general negative interactions with the general public, and driven home with the overall narrative society builds, that being homeless is a moral failure (cough Elon who says shit like “homeless is propaganda for drug addicts”, like being any sort of addict is a moral failing). 

All yalls trauma is valid. And follow up questions for the collective, have there been things that have helped with that trauma? Being exposed to the raw depths of emptiness that lies in the human soul would radicalize the best of us"

The UK has always voted majority left wing/progressive, the context over here is very different from in the US and a lot of the right wing narratives present in US politics just don't resonate as much outside of a niche audience. Hell, in the last GE the Tories and Reform only got a combined vote share of 38%. Not to mention Reform's vote share is incredibly spread out rather than being concentrated, which makes it harder for them to succeed under a FPTP system. Reforms vote share in the last GE is also barely an increase on what UKIP achieved at their height which is a pretty good indicator that, contrary to popular belief, Farage's popularity with voters hasn't at all grown.  

It'd take an awful lot for Reform to gain even more ground, where are they realistically going to get votes from? The only party they even have a chance of taking voters from is the Tories - even then I don't think there's a sizeable number of Tories left who'd consider making the switch who haven't already. Lib Dem voters aren't going to vote Reform - the Lib Dems literally gained voters from the Tories because the Tories had moved too far to the right. Green voter certainly won't vote Reform - the Greens gained voters because Labour weren't left wing enough. A section of more working class Labour voters might consider voting Reform, but I highly doubt it unless Labour severely screw up - even then I think it's more likely they'd switch to the Tories if the Tories elect a more moderate leader."

Shoplifters are budgeted for in the financial forecasts so it doesn’t really hurt them unless it goes over the budget.

The only thing that shoplifters have to watch out for is repeat offending. If the store or police can build a case for them stealing over $5,000 in total, they can get a felony (I believe - may be inaccurate now).

Otherwise, it’s pretty much no risk as you can just walk out of any major retailer if caught and nobody will stop you.

#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #10 (value)
 
""**Bitcoin/crypto is a 'store of value'**"" / ""**Bitcoin/crypto is 'digital gold'""** / ""**Crypto is an 'investment'**"" / ""**Bitcoin is 'hard money'**""

 1.  Crypto's ""value"" is unreliable and highly subjective.  It cannot be used as a currency or to pay for almost anything in any major country.  It has high requirements and risk to even be traded. At best it's a speculative commodity that a very small set of people attribute value to.  That attribution is more based on emotion and indoctrination than logic, reason, evidence, and utility.

 2.  Crypto is too chaotic to be any sort of reliable store of value over time.  Its price can fluctuate wildly based on everything from [market manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10984) to [random tweets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162522006333).  No reliable store of value should vary in ""value"" 10-30% in a single day, yet many cryptos do.

 3.  Crypto's value is *extrinsic*.  Any ""value"" associated with crypto is based on popularity and not any material or intrinsic use.  See this [detailed video debunking crypto as 'digital gold'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4446s)

 4.  Even gold, while being a lousy investment and also an undesirable store of value in the modern age, at least has material use and utility.  Crypto does not.  And whether you think gold's price is not consistent with its material utility, if that really were the case then gold would not be used industrially.  But it is.

 5.  The supposed ""value"" of crypto is based on reports from unregulated exchanges, most of whom have been caught [manipulating the market](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21) and [inflation introduced by unsecured stablecoins](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21).  There's nothing ""organic"" or ""natural"" about it.  It's an illusion.

 6.  The operation of crypto is a negative-sum-game, which means that in order for bitcoin/crypto to even exist, there must be a constant operation of third parties who must find it profitable to operate the blockchain, which requires the price to constantly rise, which is mathematically impossible, and the moment this doesn't happen, the network will collapse, at which point crypto will cease to exist, much less hold any value.  This has already happened to tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies.

 7. Many of the most trusted, most successful entities in the world of finance do not consider crypto/bitcoin to be a reliable store of value.  Crypto is [prohibited from being used as collateral by the DTC](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2024/4/26/B20002-24.pdf) and respectable institutions such as Vanguard [do not believe crypto belongs in their investment portfolio](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/cryptocurrencies-and-vanguard-what-we-think).

 8.  There is not a single example of anything like crypto, which has no material use and no intrinsic value, holding value over a long period of time across different cultures.  This is **not** because ""crypto is different and unique.""  It's because attributing value to an utterly useless piece of digital data that wastes tons of energy and perpetuates tons of fraud,*makes no freaking sense* for ethical, empathetic, non-scamming, non-exploitative, non-criminal people."

Der Generator eines normalen Benziners kann mehrere Kilowatt elektrischer Leistung bereitstellen, und da reden wir noch nicht von exotiscer Technik wie 48V-Systemen oder hybrid-SG, sondern ganz normale riemengetriebene Startergeneratoren, wie es sie seit Jahrzehnten gibt. Auch jetzt schon werden in Hybridfahrzeugen Startergeneratoren mit zweistelligen kW-Leistungen verbaut. Das reicht auch für dicke ML-Hardware. Auch im Elektroauto willst du nicht, dass dir die FPGAs über ein kW wegheizen.

Die Motorsteuerung kann beim Verbrenner genauso elektronisch erfolgen wie die eines Elektromotors. Der Honda NSX hat das bereits 1995 umgesetzt.

Dass Steer-by-Wire nichts mit dem Motor zu tun hat, sollte klar sein; ebensowenig die Sensorik.

Ich mag Elektroautos sehr. Ich bin überzeugt von ihnen. Ich bin mehrere sehr verschiedene im Alltagsbetrieb gefahren. Der Tesla hat sich angefühlt wie die Zukunft. Der Lexus fühlt sich an wie ein (sehr komfortabler, sehr kräftiger) Verbrenner. Die deutlich besseren Assistenzsysteme hat übrigens der Lexus.

Musk has an obsessive ego, lots of money to burn, and he's best bros with Putin. Putin would LOVE for the US Govt to drop the F-16s, and Putin has been working on Trump to pull us out of NATO, which would be a disaster for the free world, so I could see Putin helping Musk launch drone swarms.

I'd take an academically successful 23 year old into a PA program before an 10 year EMT who squeaked by in rigorous science courses.

Where PAs fall off is a lack of serious ongoing learning once they graduate. Many do the minimum to maintain NCCPA certification, but that's it. And that's why a lot of docs think, as a whole, we don't belong in certain fields like EM."

I have heard them talk about shutting down the EPA and the FDA. 

The FDA is there to prevent food and drug companies from poisoning you and selling ""snake oil"" to unsuspecting consumers. Which happened a lot before the FDA

The EPA is there to prevent corporations from poisoning, the air and the water and the land in America. This organization came along because companies did not really want to spend the money to properly dispose of things so they would literally dump all of their waste right into the river and kill all of the fish and poison humans.

Elon musk along with Amazon and trader Joe's are suing the government to shut down the NLRB because they don't want the government to be able to enforce rules surrounding unionizing. While this is good for big companies. It's definitely bad for workers.

Trump wants to give his fellow rich people a huge tax cut which essentially lowers America's income and means that they cannot afford as many programs. So the only way the witch can get that extra money is to shut down programs that benefit everybody else. This is why they are talking about shutting down social security and Medicaid and Medicare. 

The rich already think of you as disposable and now they are just trying to make you even more disposable, which should be fine because they have outlawed abortion, so there should be lots of unwanted young humans to run their machines."

Having money makes money and being poor costs money, and flat taxes only massively increase that regressive effect. Even a straight percentage still is regressive. And if you believe in bootstraps or a 'land of opportunity' or something like that I'm afraid to tell you that that ship has long since sailed.

Even though, as a liberal, I'm enjoying the MAGA implosion about H1-B visas -- and I'm doing everything I can to fan the flames -- I'm also fairly confident that this is just the first of many, many MAGA civil wars to come.

So some the narratives that is driving right now are combinations of those ...

* The ""leapardsatemyface"" response, which is that everyone who voted for Trump will be double crossed and suffer the consequences of their (in their eyes) stupid actions, a combination of (2) and (4).
* The ""they don't have a mandate"" response, which is a play on (4) that somehow the election was either stolen, or that it wasn't a landslide, or Fox News is lying, ..
* The ""President Musk"" angle, which is basically just meme circle jerk with no real purpose.
* The ""stop nominees at all cost"" narrative, which is a play on (3) and (4) that every Trump nominee is worse than the last, the ""parade of horribles"", accusing every one of them of sexual misconduct, basically setting up to try to Brett Kavanaugh all of them by showboating the confirmation hearings.
* Another play on (3) is that Trump and his supporters are so evil that Congress has to stop him, which is what some total idiot writer on The Hill proposed today ... (I still can't believe The Hill even published that stupid shit, but they did).
* Reddit is still filled with variations on (3) with people writing ""I'm never speaking to my family again ..."" rants on advice and other subs, because they voted for Trump .. there are literally like 50 of these posts per day, many per hour still, even two months out from the election ..

So, basically, the same as it ever was, except Democrats are still stunned from the election so they are just chaotically shitting all over everything they lay their eyes on trying to figure out how best to gain some kind of leverage, when they've essentially lost everything. At the moment they don't have enough power to decide what toilet paper brand to use on Congressional bathrooms, so ..

Personally I find it reassuring that the most trouble they can cause is ""President Musk"" memes ... let them fuck around with that for the next 2 years ... it seems to be entertaining them, and is keeping them out of trouble.

Democrats will regain a foothold when the actual deportations start happening, and the news media jams a camera into the face of every crying woman with a child .. they're already starting to do that with ""So-and-so brown person is worried about upcoming deportation"" stories ...

Most importantly, your calories seem way too low. I recently tried to drop to 1000 cals and it was too low for me as a 5'6 woman, 1000 is way too low for a 6' man. I went back up to 1200 and some days I let myself go over by another 200 if I'm really hungry from the gym).

 I think it's important to teach kids how to treat you, just like anyone else. So, you can just tell them: we don't put other people down.
I also think 3.5 is a totally appropriate age to explain that sometimes families need to step up for each other. You didn't sleep, which means that your 3.5 year old is going to need to do what she's supposed to do without complaint or at least not putting their feelings onto someone else's actions.
I tell my kiddo: It's ok to say I need to play with you or have a hug or (insert thing you've noticed is the actual thing). It's okay to say I'm mad, I don't want a nap. But feelings are not the same as critiques. 

 Someday you will have a teenager and yes they are known for exaggeration and lashing out. But, teenagers are often sensitive and if they know the rules of engagement (we don't say certain things even in the heat of the moment) it's entirely possible you'll have fairer fights a decade from now when the stakes are higher. They may think it (Mom is so unfair and mean. She won't let me stay out all night with my friends or play on my phone all the time.) but they will have the filter to perhaps not always say it. They know, deeper down, that it's hurtful and not constructive. And when they're an adult that skill is going to continue to pay off in dividends.

 Based on your post I'm basically saying things you know, and I get that this post was mostly venting because parenting is hard. I hope you get some rest and are able to get some relaxing time with your kids!"

>Again - I appreciate the in depth responses and glad this has sparked an interest.

>I’ve never really thought that much about AS Johnston, just that those who think that he would have been a difference maker if he hadn’t been killed are making a giant assumption.

Yeah, that's just my nerd self. I've studied a ton of commanders and analyzed them quite a lot, following the footsteps of one of my favourite military historians and a veteran of our Civil War, Theodore Ayrault Dodge (he has a book series on the great captains of history), and looking at things in much the same vein as he has.

I will say that A.S. Johnston is most definitely overrated. Though, I suppose people love ""what-ifs"" of how events might have turned out if X individual didn't die too soon. However, whether it be A.S. Johnston or Jackson, I don't think their being alive would have changed the outcome of the war. The North had a very slim chance of losing.

>His ability to see an opportunity and act upon it - Halleck would have had him stop at Fort Henry. Grant was taking a chance - not just with his army - but with his career.

Yes, this is most definitely something Grant has in his favour. I always liked his bold attitude and his willingness to *try*. Some, like Sherman, were a bit too passive at times and could have stood to be more bold like Grant at certain moments. Then again, cutting off from his own communications to conduct a march through Georgia, subsisting off of forage and his baggage is already quite bold in the context of the ACW.

>Nobody in the ACW - and I’m guessing - throughout history - could absorb a blow like Grant could - and turn it into a victory.

>This isn’t to take issue with any of your analysis here. It’s pretty much spot on as far as I can see. Both to what happened and what might have happened.

>But - to me - it’s kind of like saying that a guy made a mistake while pitching a perfect game, and the batter fouled it off instead of putting it in play.

When you get to differentiating the good generals from those who are very good or even spectacular, there are many individuals who have won great renown in campaigns. There are many individuals who have won their war or several wars for that matter. At that point, whether one wins the war does not determine an astounding commander, it is *how* they conducted themselves while waging war.

Some are put in unique circumstances where they were disadvantaged in every way from the start and there was little chance they could have won due to factors completely out of their control. How do we judge these individuals other than by their conduct during the war itself, rather than whether they won it or not?

Again, as I've said before, Grant stands among the top echelons when we speak of our Civil War and of the generals America has produced. There's no doubt about this. Yet, I just don't think that he is up there playing internationals.

There are plenty of commanders like Grant, who could absorb a blow and turn it into a victory, even when the resource disparity between them and their enemies was not as great relative to what advantages the Union possessed over the Confederacy. Here's one example of just such an individual:"

Not sure that is true when Tesla says:

I get some will say Tesla wants the $ or manufacturers want the $ from selling/providing those adapters and that a 3rd party is making some of the adapters for Ford and likely others but there is an inherent risk to violating what the ""rules"" are at the charging station.

A liability is being taking on by those that go against what Tesla is saying at [https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/supercharging-other-evs#vehicles](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/supercharging-other-evs#vehicles)

Unless somewhere else they list a certified 3rd party chargers it may be best to stick with what Tesla is saying is acceptable (from a liability standpoint)."

Probably the most important things are staying hydrated and avoiding smoking. Some herbs and spices will permeate through your body and make you smell like them, which can be either good or bad depending on what people like. Garlic and fenugreek are two of the herbs that do that most strongly, but you can notice it with many other herbs and spices.

Some people find eating a lot of red meat gives people a ""heavy"" or more strongly musky smell. Eating more seafood will often make you have a milder smell; it will not necessarily make you smell ""fishy"", just a bit lighter. Eating more fresh fruits and vegetables also can give you a fresher smell. I have been told by many people that carrot-family plants such as carrots, celery, and parsley, are the ones most likely to give people a fresher smell, not sure if that's true or not but my wife and I both eat a diet high in those vegetables and we both like how each other smells.

Probiotics, like yogurt or kimchi or other fermented foods, and prebiotics (fiber, like from whole grain, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables) are the main ingredients in good gut health. If your gut health is good your vaginal health will be better because many of the gut bacteria also colonize the vagina due to proximity, but also because gut health effects immune function and better immune function leads to better vaginal health, like controlling harmful strains of yeast and bacteria, and the more harmful strains often have an unpleasant smell.

Also anything that affects overall health can affect your smell. Get enough sleep, get enough exercise daily, and keep your stress level low and you will have better immune function and that will help you smell better too.

The vagina will always have a distinctive smell, sometimes quite strong, but if you are healthier, it will be more likely that both you and others will perceive it as a good smell, or at least neutral. I really like the smell of healthy vaginas, but I have noticed that some past partners would smell pretty bad, the worst ones being smokers, or people who were under a lot of stress and not in great health and not eating the best diet. I see a pretty clear pattern."

You are not entitled to her money; even if she were Gates/Musk/Ellison rich, that doesn't mean that she owes it to you to pay for things for you.

If the car that she would be willing to lend you is unavailable, and you don't want to spend money on a rental of your own, then don't go, and reschedule the trip for another time.

But TBH, the attitude of ""she is responsible for providing me with a transportation option that meets my specific requirements"" thing is a little bit dated on a 29-year-old.

You're not entitled to the use of her car, either, even if she's lent it to you in the past.

Because she KNOWS this is insane. She KNOWS that if she was totally honest with her therapist, that her therapist might be obligated to call CPS.

Consider this carefully- she is PAYING this professional to help her AND is actively deceiving them. 

She knows what she is doing is unacceptable. She is manipulating people around her so she can continue. 

Some people need rock bottom before they get the right diagnosis and turn things around. You can say “I don’t want you to starve, but you’re not welcome at my table for dinner.”

I had a friend in a similar situation and we didn’t talk for four years while she downward spiraled. Later, when she got her act together we became friends again now going on six years. 

I am so glad I distanced myself; her addict ex ended up robbing her, and at one point she had a key to my place which I am sure he would have robbed too if he has access to it at the time. The dude even stole shit that belong to her son (child from previous marriage). A year after that she had a car full of guys roll up on her place with guns because he owed them money and her son was in the house has they forced their way into her house to beat the shit out of her ex. If I had still been her friend I could have been there chatting with her when that happened.

You are ALSO in danger with her bad decisions. That is my point.

I would recommend to call CPS; honestly so many people she could blame for that report I wouldn’t worry she would instantly associate with you. 

You don’t need to explain to her why her behavior is unacceptable or how; it isn’t a lack of understanding… she is fully aware, that is why she is hiding it from her therapist. You do need to make boundaries for yourself. “If X, then Y”

“As long as you are involved with a coke addict, I can’t hang out with you. I love you and wish you the best” (be prepared for her to lie and hide like with the therapist tho) 

“As long as you are in an abusive relationship, I cannot spend time around you. If you ever are serious and want to leave this relationship I am there for you.” 

Boundaries are “if you do X, then I do Y”. you cannot force her to change, and I would not waste my time telling her what or how she needs to change. She likely knows and that is why she is not disclosing to her therapist."
1,2024-12-02,u/MiltonFury,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1h3gdon/does_trump_campaign_on_identity_politics/m05iohl/,">You gave me an example of the FBI investigating threats towards school board members...

They investigated people that had made no threats whatsoever. [The DOJ made a broad claim that they're are more unspecified threats](https://www.justice.gov/ag/file/1170061-0/dl?inline=), and without any particular threat to investigate, FBI was sent to school board meetings use the Antiterrorism Act to threaten on parents and look for anything they could perceive as a threat in order to stifle criticism of school boards.

The attorney general stated: ""*The Department takes these incidents seriously and is committed to using its authority and resources to discourage these threats, identify them when they occur...*"" so they went to school board meetings to look for threats that may occur so they can identify them. Amazing! :)

>and I haven’t seen any evidence to support that the FBI specifically colluded with Twitter and Facebook to block information that would be damaging to democrats.

They colluded to block the Hunter Biden laptop story back in 2020, which would have been damaging to Joe Biden (a Democrat running for President at the time). But this isn't just about the information that's damaging to Democrats, it's about violations of the free speech rights of Americans. And the evidence for both has been released by Elon Musk when he purchased Twitter and it was presented at the hearings under oath during the House Hearing (the video of which I shared earlier).

>This is what’s really contributing to our border crisis. People can cross illegally, and once they get to the US they can just claim asylum.

They're crossing illegally because the Biden administration let them cross illegally. They can claim asylum even without crossing illegally (i.e. at any port of entry legally).

>As a side note, a Trump endorsed politician James Lankford co authored a bill that would’ve helped this process but Trump told republicans to vote against it

The bill was not needed to keep illegals from crossing the border during the Trump administration or the Obama administration. They just enforced the existing laws and kept illegals from crossing. That bill just made it legal to maintain the insane flow of illegals.

>Like I said before, this is the law. We have a border crisis, no disagreement there but I just don’t see the malice that you’re seeing

Yeah, the border crisis was created by the Biden administration by allowing illegals to cross into the country illegally. They know the ramifications of it and they had no problem with it. This actively harmed American citizens who were already struggling economically.

>How would hurting the economic status of Americans help them at all? Would it not be better to have the people be thriving economically? Especially as we become more hostile with countries like Russia and China. What sense does it make to purposely sabotage our economy like that?

The demographics of Democrat voters has shifted away from the middle class and toward the both the very rich and the very poor. [The middle-class has increasingly voted for Republicans (i.e. Trump)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/09/democrats-working-class-exodus-sets-off-reckoning-within-party/76117107007/). So the Democrats knew that they can't make more rich people so the only two options they had left were to either import more poor people or to make our people poorer. And they decided to do BOTH!"

A lot of 1911 owners think their gun is special, its not. Its a 100 year old design, it has flaws. Theyre heavy, theyre single action only, theyre a .45, theyre a 7-8 round mag, 1911s are outdated and anyone who thinks its better to carry than a glock 19 is dead wrong. The glock is lighter, holds twice as many bullets, is more practical caliber, easier to find, cheaper, and quicker follow up shots. A glock doesnt have an external safety but it does have safeties. Theres a reason they dont have external safeties. If you pull a 1911 and it is cocked and locked, you still have to put the safety down to shoot which is loud and could give up the element of suprise. A glock is striker fired so its always ready to shoot. Now, whats safer, a gun that you know is always ready to go, and wont go off accidentally, or some 100 year old boat anchor that you have to make sure the hammers back, have to make sure the safeties off, thats a lot of moving parts. If youre at home, ideally youd keep it just like you were carrying it, but some wont, then you get mixed up. If a 1911 was a good carry option the military would still be using it as a side arm. But they dont. For the same reason they dont use muskets anymore. The point is, dont listen to people who carry 1911s in 2024 because if they think its a good gun worth carrying their advice isnt very valueable."

When someone reports something that isn't true for the purpose of getting an official police response. The police MUST come because someone could be in danger even if no one actually is. 


Same thing here with some nuance. Hysteria has people literally shooting at passenger aircraft. Someone sees a ""drone"" and calls it in because everything in the sky is a drone now, airport forced to redirect flights for safety reasons.


There are a few actual drones but they're commercial models belonging to businesses like Amazon or hobbyists trying to copycat.

People like Musk and Bezos wouldn't be rich without workers to actually build their cars\rockets or ship the products they sell.

And preferably, they want an abundance of workers, more workers than jobs. That gives them leverage to keep wages and benefits down. If the demand for workers is greater than the supply of workers, they have to compete for workers, driving up costs. 

I think this is the real reason the right is pushing so hard for people to have kids. They want a large labor force so they can keep wages low."

Do we have any official records on Elon's IQ? Not to mention that IQ has been compared time and time again to be an unreliable indicator of actual intelligence. One brief glimpse at Elon's Twitter account, and it's immediately evident that he's very stupid, doesn't know what he's talking about and is always spreading disinformation without proper sources.

Multiple companies at the forefront of sustainability: Not only does Elon come from wealth (Meaning that he didn't even earn his place), but his industries have suffered several losses since he began working at them, and he mostly depends on government subsidies and loans. Even if we ignore some of the success that Tesla or SpaceX had, Twitter itself had its value reduced by 80% since he took over, not to mention that the site is objectively worse now (It's filled with bots, the paid blue checks are annoying, the X name is confusing and stupid, etc.)

Environmental impact reduction: If Elon supposedly cares about that so much, why is he partnering with the American right wing, which doesn't believe in climate change and doesn't want to force companies to do anything about it. His electric cars are also not very good (See, Cybertruck) and Trump's subsidies would make it harder and more expensive to buy better electric cars from other countries."

But, the Supreme Court was not denying the existence of transgender discrimination. Amy Coney Barrett in fact explicitly talked about “private discrimination” against transgender people, including its prevalence in history. She was questioning the historical basis of “de jure” discrimination, meaning discrimination based in legislation and social institutions, since as far she could tell there wasn’t as long a history of anti-trans laws in the U.S. like there were anti-Black laws, anti-gay laws, or anti-women laws. But, she also seemingly recognized the current anti-trans laws as discriminatory. She said, “In the last three years we have these laws, but before that… is there a history that I don’t know about where we have de jure discrimination? … I don’t want to be misunderstood to say that I don’t think there’s a problem or that there hasn’t been private discrimination.” And the people on our side talked about historical restrictions of trans people, like making crossdressing a crime or banning trans people from the military. 

The court has higher and lower bars that a law has to clear to stay constitutional. They have three levels. The higher the bar, the harder it is for the law to stay in effect. The lowest bar is “rational basis”, which almost every law passes. The people on our side are saying the court should put gender-affirming care bans against “heightened scrutiny”, a higher bar which would more likely strike down the bans and keep access to care in place, a good thing for us. 

Sex discrimination is a heightened scrutiny category. That’s why the people on our side are trying to argue that the Tennessee law discriminates based on sex. It’s the most straightforward path to heightened scrutiny and better legal safeguards for trans rights. 

If you don’t get discrimination based on sex, the main other way to get heightened scrutiny is to get “transgender status” declared as a “quasi-suspect classification”, a constitutional law category that basically would make it easier to strike down laws that discriminate based on gender. Quasi-suspect defends groups of people that have been “historically subject to discrimination.” Which is why Amy Coney Barrett was asking those questions about history. Historically, the court rarely gives those classifications. 

The conservative majority of the court asked more hard-hitting questions to the people on our side than the other side, which is why the news headlines say “the Supreme Court leans towards upholding the care ban.” Gorsuch and Barrett seem like the most likely swing votes. Gorsuch didn’t say anything during the oral arguments, and has been surprisingly good for us in past court actions, and Barrett seemed more on our side than the other conservative justices. The three liberal justices were definitely on our side. 

The rest of the conservatives seem reluctant to restrict the ability of the legislature to regulate issues of “medical nuance”, the reasoning being that “the court is less primed to answer complicated medical questions than the legislatures are.” But on the other hand, if the Tennessee care ban goes by rational basis review instead of heightened scrutiny, that makes it harder for trans rights for at least a little while. The states would be more able to pass anti-trans laws. The court probably doesn’t want this, but the court is also very cautious of deciding questions they think belong more to the legislatures. 

Regardless, the Supreme Court opinion is going to be more complicated than merely “the bans are okay”, or “the bans are not okay.” Depending on what the court says, that could change the legal landscape around these laws, potentially making it easier or harder to defend trans rights in the coming days. 

Even if we lose this case on equal protection, you can still bring “Due Process cases” to defend trans people, and we can still advocate for legislatures to pass state and federal laws which protect against anti-trans discrimination. It’s just harder if the court doesn’t help us here. The court is meant to inform legal discussions and help us get rid of bad laws and put forward good laws. 

TL;DR - The court is having complicated legal discussions, not denying our existence or denying discrimination against us. You could still criticize the focus of the conservative court and the questions they asked versus “should have asked.” Some of the conservatives might rule in our favor, or they might not. We don’t know. The people on our side did a great job answering all the questions the justices asked."

Like for example: Kamala has admitted to smoking Marijuana while it was illegal. Now of course she's not been arrested or found guilty of it. Which is fine, I'm not saying she should be. But imagine she had. Would you not vote for her over a felony Marijuana conviction and vote for Trump instead? Of course you wouldn't.


So I don't really see the obsession about the charges. Especially since by now they have set aside any sentencing. And i don't think anyone actually has been harmed. It's not like he killed someone or something. So why would anyone really care much?"

To do this, lookup the phone number on the carrier lookup and look at the results. If the results says that the number belongs to a residential carrier (ex. AT&T/""Cingular Wireless"", Verizon Wireless, Metro PCS, Rogers, etc.), *DO NOT* call the number.

Gen 38:9 says, “And Onan   knew   that   the seed   should not  be his; and it came to pass,   when   he went in unto  his brother’s   wife,   that he spilled   it on the ground,  lest  that he should give   seed   to his brother. “ I initially thought that Onan spilled his seed so that he didn’t have to raise his brothers children, but I came across this, “I argue: it is not, because there is no presumption of ongoing (lifelong) sxual relations between the “husband” and the “wife.” The sole reason for the congress of the two is the production of an heir for the sake of the dead brother (who lacked one), and end-of-life care for the wife/mother.” So your claim does seem substantial! I just thought it would have been a “true/normal” marriage where sleeping with this new wife would have been a standard practice between husband and wife.
I’m glad you responded because I got the chance to learn something new/right today. Thank you!

It realistically could be seen as an OU mon for the purposes of this discussion because it's genuinely being used successfully in the tier.

You could set the bar at 1%, 2%, maybe even 3% if you wanted to (though that would restrict it to all but 15 proper OU mons), or say that OR having a VR placement (take Dread's Vileplume nomination, Vileplume has 0.3% OU usage, but it **does** have an OU VR placement.

some examples are things like airtags and pebblebees given out to everyone in the city to put in their cars. carjackings would drop precipitously if citizens can track their vehicle and give the information to the police (and if the police actually put forth some effort). 

or another example might be to make policing policies more neighborhood-specific. if you feel like your community is over-policed, fine, you get less policing and some other neighborhood that feels under-policed will get more. right now, some communities feel over-policed and then the city PD reduces the effort put into policing city-wide. I even think some cities need to just embrace private police forces like are common on college campuses. my city's police are absolutely worthless and put forth no effort (I was assaulted with broken bones and neither the police not the prosecutor bothered to request the security camera footage). or the time when a friend's house was broken into and the thief dropped their cellphone while climbing through the window. the police didn't take the phone or try to see who it belonged to; that's too much effort for them. police mostly just sit in their car and wait for some serious crime or give people information to fill out insurance claims. there is no active policing or investigation unless *maybe* it's a murder. however, if a neighborhood employs you as a cop and you're lazy, the neighborhood can just fire you. 

etc. etc. 

there are lots of things that can be done to make improvements, but we just don't do it because a few people complain."

1,2024-12-24,u/AbroadTraditional107,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1hktn1h/ebay_or_paypal_wont_help/m3ndgyq/,"What the seller should’ve done is give the computer back to the storage facility because it has a company logo on it. 

 The seller bought a storage unit at auction that contains a company computer, the computer likely does not belong to the seller and you should not use it; it is considered abandoned property, but the company could still have legal claims to it depending on the circumstances and local laws. 
Why you should not keep the computer:
Ownership rights:
When a storage unit is auctioned, the buyer typically acquires ownership of everything inside “as is,” but this doesn’t necessarily mean they have the right to use items that might belong to a third party, like a company computer. 
Potential legal issues:
If the company discovers their computer in your possession, they could take legal action to reclaim it, potentially leading to lawsuits and fines. 
What you should do:
Contact the storage facility:
Check if they have any information about who rented the storage unit and if the company computer was reported missing. 
Try to contact the company:
If you can identify the company the computer belongs to, reach out to them to discuss the situation."

This raises the question: what does marriage mean to you? 

A legal contract? A lifelong commitment? A ring and a ceremony? The ability to take a man's resources via divorce?

I'm under the impression that 120 years ago, marriage licenses did not exist (some say they were invented at the same time as income tax, around 1913). So they just had a ceremony and a ring, but no marriage license. I'm also under the impression that divorce did not really exist in the past either - people almost never got divorced. Now it's up to like 58% of marriages in the U.S. I heard.

Modern marriage is a completely new animal, compared to marriage in all previous human history.

P.S. reddit seems like it is extremely pro-divorce, pro-separation, pro-breakup, so keep that in mind."

Your sister's help with your tuition was a generous gift, not a lifelong obligation to provide free labor. It’s understandable she’s stressed as a working mother, but her decision to help with your education doesn’t entitle her to demand free babysitting in return. You’ve expressed appreciation for her generosity, and you’re entitled to set boundaries around your time and energy.

The family pushing you to work for free seems unfair, especially since regular babysitting is a big responsibility. Gratitude doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your needs or commitments. If they’re so insistent, perhaps they can step in to support her instead. Your time is valuable, and it’s reasonable to expect compensation for such a significant ask."

Our batteries typically last almost a decade and sometimes longer (200k miles with regular maintenance is quite common). They’re about $1.5-3k to replace. Not a bad deal for a once in a decade expense, and it makes it easy to afford a used hybrid given how high the mpg’s are on them. 

EV batteries will be much more expensive as they’re much larger, but should last close to as many years. Tesla warrants its batteries for 8 years or 150k miles, which is a lot. They actually tend to last at least 300k miles in real world conditions, with many lasting upwards of 500k miles so far before needing replacement. They also typically get closer to 100mpg-equivalent fuel economy. That’s pretty damn good. 

Your typical used ICE engine will need a seriously expensive rebuild around 150-200k miles, although yes, some higher quality builds that definitely cost more than a Kia Rio will last much longer. 

Yes the price can and will go down over the next few years, but EVs already outlast the average by a healthy margin."

I do enjoy engaging with people who disagree with me because I think honest discourse is direly needed in our society. So if you disagree, and feel so inclined, reply with your opinion.

The ethics question here is rooted in a common misunderstanding of what net worth means, and how it is formed. 

Elon has very little actual money. The reason we say his net worth increased by $70B is because we measure company value in dollars. He can’t spend any of that. To get money he needs sell ownership of his company. But if he started selling-off billions of Tesla stock it would cause other people to worry something’s wrong and sell-off their shares, too. This sell-off would cause his remaining ownership to be worth less. If he tried to sell off all $400bn it would be impossible because the value would plummet before all the shares were sold. 

Don’t get me wrong he’s still the richest person in the world and could sell enough shares to live like the richest person in the world without much consequence. But the point is unless he sells off those shares, he hasn’t actually gained anything.

So why is Tesla valued so highly, and why did it go up by $70bn recently? Purely because shareholders think Tesla is going to be worth more in the future. 

What determines Elon’s net worth is actually just how many people wanna buy Tesla stock. It’s nothing Trump did. People just think Tesla is going to go up, and are buying more of it. 

And I don’t see anything unethical about that."

I’ll gloss over the many examples of obnoxious misinformation, just spewing things he read once and wants to believe while being fact checked by his own producer yet still not learning anything.  Rogan has surrounded himself with fucking ghouls over the past year. Peter Thiel, musk, Marc Andreessen, Bill Ackman, could go on but basically he is a whore for money and power I.e. Vance and Trump on but not even a Kamala surrogate. Believe me I despise Kamala
But to pretend to be some kind of liberal or leftist and clearly favor the neofascist candidate without even giving a chance to the alternative, it’s clear where his politics are now and it’s a politic for fucking tech billionaires."

Mais en quelques mots : 

Ayant été directeur de rédaction de l'Express c'est, pour une émission politique, l'assurance d'avoir un invité qui produira un discours dont l'expression répondra parfaitement aux normes médiatiques, que ce soit dans sa forme par un parler journalistique, un rythme, une capacité de synthèse, etc. le tout ayant déjà été éprouvé et vérifié dans son travail à L'Express... Que dans le fond... Etant directeur de rédaction, il a donc un droit de regard sur le contenu présentés dans l'hebdomadaire qui l'emploie. Aussi pour le rédacteur en chef d'une émission politique, c'est l'assurance d'avoir un discours connu, convenu et consensuel.

Rappelons qu'il n'y a rien de plus effrayant pour celles et ceux qui font une émission que de perdre le contrôle de l'émission et de ce qui s'y dit. Lorsqu'un invité sort des clous et qu'il y a un dérapage, il n'est pas rare de voir une sanction de l'ARCOM (anciennement CSA) suivre, comme on a pu le voir sur TPMP avec le passage de Louis Boyard. Christophe Barbier, c'est en sommes un invité coopoté rassurant pour celles et ceux qui font une émission télé.

Enfin, du fait de son statut d'ancien directeur de rédaction de l'Express, il jouï d'un statut qui lui confère une légitimité, une forme d'expertise sur les questions politique. Il apparait dans un certain sens comme une figure d'autorité légitime pour produire un discours politique, quand bien même le gros de ses prises de paroles se résument à enchaîner du prêt à penser, articulé par des éléments de language pour finalement ne rien dire de pertinent sur des sujets qu'il ne maîtrise globalement pas. 

A noter que tout ceci s'applique très exactement à l'ensemble des journalistes politiques et éditorialistes (ou propagandistes) continuellement sur les plateaux télé. Leur rôle n'est pas d'être expert d'un sujet, leur rôle est de produire un discours normatif convenu et d'être des investissement rassurant pour ceux qui organisent ces émissions. Ils sont l'assurance d'avoir un plateau télé bien rempli où la ligne éditoriale sera bien tenue dans une forme parfaitement maîtrisée."

9,2024-12-14,u/ZetaPower,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hedie8/consumption_suddenly_skyrocketing/m23894x/,"Winter in an EV demonstrates why you want the biggest battery you can get….
Consumption is INEVITABLY higher, because:

	• rolling resistance increases in cold weather. This increases consumption.
	• winter tires cause higher rolling resistance. This increases consumption.
	• cold air is denser. Air drag resistance increases ±10%, highway consumption increases by 10% too.
	• wind and precipitation increase consumption further.
	• heating requires energy from the battery.

The Tavascan has a Cd (air drag coefficient) of 0.26, which is standard for an SUV style vehicle, but its HIGH compared to sedan-ish shaped vehicles (closer to 0.2). Base consumption is therefore already high. This increases by 10-20% in winter due to rolling resistance and air drag resistance.

The heating is a separate issue. This is the ONLY parameter you can influence…..
EVs are too efficient to have enough residual heat to heat the battery & cabin. The bulk of the heat must be made using energy in the battery!
At 0C you probably need ± 3-4kW of continuous heating.
There are 2 types of heating:

	• resistive heating
	• heat pump

Resistive heating is the simple solution. Current is run through a PTC-element (like in an oven), this gets hot, this heats the cabin & battery. Problem is the efficiency (COP), this is 1 by definition. Every 1kWh of heat costs 1kWh of energy from the battery.

Heat pumps are way better (good ones…). A pump transports energy from outside to inside (reverse fridge/AC). The only consumer is the pump. At 15C this has a COP of 4 (Tesla)! 1kWh of heat now costs 0,25kWh of energy from the battery! At -15C the pump must work so hard it costs so much energy to run that the COP drops to 1 (Tesla). 0C would maybe run you a COP of 2,5 and cost you less than half the energy of a resistive heater.

The heat pump is of course an OPTION in your EV. Do you have it?

Next….
Short drives…..
Every drive requires the car to heat the battery and cabin. This initial consumption can easily DOUBLE your consumption!


What can you do to maximize range/minimize consumption?

	• SLOW DOWN, biggest factor in consumption
	• preheat the cabin & battery before a drive, saves you the initial consumption
	• reduce heating: use the seat heater (100W !) & steering wheel heater (50W) & lower the cabin temp
	• keep your tires inflated to the advised pressure. Cold lowers tire pressure, low tire pressure increases rolling resistance"

You’re not alone, and sometimes, some of us want kids and “can’t” have them without having directly impacting health issues per se. 

For example, I have no reason to believe I have fertility issues but I don’t have a child yet and I feel like I’m constantly put in impossible situations. I’ve just lost two years of my 30s dealing with serious trauma which de facto made me unfit to date, never mind parent. As I began to come out of that, precancerous cells were found on my cervix. Boom. Guess what, no idea when I’ll next want to have sex. Not because I don’t have sex drive but because I feel like my body now belongs to my doctors. Could be 6 months, could be years. Could be surgery, could be nothing. Soon after I opened up about it my cousin who is 7 years younger than me informed me she’s pregnant with her second baby, with the man she’s been with for ~7 years now. 

My point is, while that doesn’t equal your past losses, we are all surrounded by other people living the lives we feel we are held back from. People are in love and having babies all around me, while I spend my time with a psychiatrist and an oncologist, still pondering how I would ever explain to a date that, no my parents are not dead and no you can’t ever meet them and yes those medications are forever. And then get that person to want a child with me. 

Ultimately all our days are numbered. I’ve come to realize no matter what my fate is, as much as I want it to be a family of my own children, how much I enjoy my life is going to be down to me. It’s going to be up to me to make the most of what often feels like a bombed house."

""Of the 30 cities analyzed, Canada’s largest have low population densities relative to international counterparts. The coastal tourist hubs of San Francisco and Barcelona are 1.31 and 2.89 times as dense as Vancouver, Canada’s densest major city. Chicago, New York, and London are 1.03, 2.45, and 2.48 times as dense as Canada’s financial and media centre, Toronto. Paris is 4.29 times as dense as Montreal, and even the Toronto suburb of Mississauga is 1.17 times as dense as Calgary, Canada’s third most populous municipality."" \~Fraser Institute

But man I gave up half way through season 2 - and I’m usually an uptight nerd about finishing things once I’ve started them. It is nowhere near the echelon of *The Wire* or multiple other David Simon projects. 

There’s maybe two or three interesting storylines/character arcs out of about 10 that are ongoing throughout the series. Even those can drag. 

I think it’s unfair to compare it to *The Wire*, but it’s inevitable given it showed us what Simon was capable of. In every episode or two there is a standout moment or piece of dialogue that just smacks you in the gut in the best possible way, whereas in *Treme* I genuinely can’t picture a single moment in the whole season and a half that I watched that stands out.

The answer is: yes and no. The beginning Cold Caverns region is limited to three mission types and the occasional beacon station. The more interesting missions—outpost takeover, salvage wreck, destroy monster nest, sub vs sub combat—all start to unlock in the second region. It's worth making your best effort to sprint for the second region at the beginning.

That being said, those missions will also eventually get repetitive. So, if your friends stick it out, they may just get bored later rather than sooner. However, there is gradually more to keep the crew occupied as you progress and each job gains the ability to craft necessities like turret ammo and fuel rods and eventually items that are locked behind perks. There are also all sorts of items you can add with mods for everyone to play around with. People always like trying out new guns!

If you can convince your friends to stick with it awhile longer, I may recommend the following additions to make it more interesting:

* Increase difficulty for more monster spawns if your friends did enjoy combat moments.
* Increase max missions to 10. Things get much more exciting when you're trying to both transport multiple groups of personnel safely, recover a wreck, and hunt hammerheads at the same time.
* Loot outposts of everything that isn't nailed down to reduce boredom while docked, or make it a goal to completely slaughter every NPC on outposts belonging to whichever faction you aren't aligned with.
* Mod the hell out of it. I've been sticking with vanilla+ until I beat the game at least once, so I can't personally speak to how certain mods overhaul the game. However, I understand a few add a dramatic amount of variety: Dynamic Europa, Barotraumatic, and More Level Content. There's also Baroverhaul, which changes the perk trees in addition to adding content. There are also multiple mods that add new wrecks, beacon stations, and outpost modules to minimize repetitive designs while doing repetitive activities. There are also several ""Immersive"" and ""Enhanced"" mods by \_\]|M|\[\_ that add complexity to simple things like dive suits and sub repairs. Again, more stuff to keep bored people busy. These mods, however, are super polished, so they feel like a real addition to gameplay rather than just making things harder. There's also Real Sonar, which makes hull breaches and leaving the sub even MORE terrifying. And there are all kinds of mods that add things like instruments, playable songs to collect, music tapes to listen to, and games to play on the sub console. There must be something on the Workshop that will entertain your buddies during the quiet periods.
* Finally, recruit enough players to make the Traitor feature feasible. That can REALLY spice things up, but it works only if there are enough people involved to make the traitor's identity difficult to guess.

In the end, it seems to me that Barotrauma is a game that rewards players who want to get better at doing the same thing. I learn a little about what NOT to do every time I run a mission. When I lose a round, I think about how I will do things differently next time. It's about learning the mechanics and refining technique to overcome the random craziness the game can unleash on you at any given moment. Also, inventory management—which is probably (sadly) my favorite aspect of any game.

I hope some of the suggestions you receive in response to your post can make the game better and draw your friends back in. If not, there are plenty of other people out there for you to play with. Every sub can use a good addition to the crew!"

Also to answer this, the best answer that comes to mind is honestly Lilly for me. She seems like she'd possibly have a very soft, soothing voice but it was more scratchy in a good way, especially the more aggressive she became in her demeanour.

Otherwise I'd maybe say... I actually don't know, this question is making me realise how well cast everyone in the series is, it's crazy. I never consider that the voice doesn't just belong to those animated characters on screen and is instead a real person. Such an unreal cast, and Nick Rapp as Lilly is absolutely included in that - since I mentioned her above.

Parece-me que não tens inteligência suficiente para perceber que ninguém tem a obrigação de te oferecer o mesmo que outras empresas oferecem. Já foi dito explicitamente pelo próprio Musk que ele considera que há imenso desperdício de dinheiro no sector, que pessoas que não merecem ser contratadas são contratadas, que números de profissionais que não precisam de ser contratados são contratados e que ordenados que não precisam de ser pagos, são pagos. 

A única razão pela qual isto te ""preocupa"" é porque tens dor de cotovelo e queres razões para atacá-lo. Tu não trabalhas nem vais trabalhar para ele. O que te interessa o que ele paga? Se o que ele paga é ""injusto"", então as pessoas ignoram-no e vão procurar os tais empregos que pagam muito bem. O mercado auto regula-se.

>Lol de imigrantes europeus , não de Indianos. Mas ok defende lá imigração só porque o pai mandou

  
Não estás bom da cabeça. Os afro-americanos representam 13.6% da população, hispânicos 18.9%,. A mão-de-obra escrava foi crucial na construção da economia agrícola do Sul, trabalhadores chineses foram essenciais na construção das ferrovias transcontinentais, e imigrantes mexicanos foram fundamentais no desenvolvimento agrícola do Sudoeste.

- Used the auto translate so it  might be off 

The 2024 international signing period ended on December 15 and a total of 29 Cubans managed to sign their signature with Major League organizations at that stage. From January 15, Diego Tornés will be one of the greatest Cuban pearls that the Major Leagues organizations will be able to sign.

Tornes is an Antillean fielder who left the island in 2021 at just 13 years old and a few months ago was declared a free agent by the MLB Commissioner’s Office. The one born in Havana is listed as the #6 prospect within the Top-50 of international talents published every year by the prestigious American magazine Baseball America.


So far, the Atlanta Braves are the favorites to hire him once the new period opens. The firm is around 3 million dollars, according to a recent report by our colleague Francys Romero. Tornés, 16 years old, would be one of the highest paid players in his class, he would be turning 17 on July 3.

He is an ambidextrous batter and shows good agility to defend the central outfielder, although in the future he looks like a corner player in the gardens. The scouts have evaluated him as one of the most advanced players in terms of tools for the next international period. His batting receives a score of 55 to 60 on the 80 scale.

Tornes’ arm and defense are considered plus, with golden glove caliber potential. His overall rating is 55, which makes him one of the best prospects for 2024/25. Alex Sánchez, former MLB player for 5 seasons between 2001-2005, who has trained and polished several talents in recent years, belongs to the Academy.


Qualities of Diego Tornés in the home

Diego Tornés has stood out for his power from both sides of the plate. He presents an excellent swing, but he is quite patient at home because of the good batting zone he presents. He has improved his speed and defense a lot (he is an above-average runner with an average arm) to the point where he could have the opportunity to play in the center field 

Scouting report: Contact: 55 | Power: 60 | Speed: 50 | Arm: 55 | Defense: 55 | Total: 55."

The obnoxious undercurrent that runs beneath right-wing opposition to a Biden pardon-palooza is the sense that it’d be unfair to exempt the likes of Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney from Republican “lawfare” after Trump was forced to endure it from Democrats. But of the [four criminal cases](https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/boilingfrogs/racket-ball/) brought against him, three were plainly meritorious and dealt with grave offenses—while the fourth, the actually trivial and political one in the bunch, nonetheless resulted in dozens of felony convictions.

Trump attempted the first presidential coup in American history, then left office with hundreds of sensitive documents which he had no right to take and which he actively concealed from the federal government despite many patient attempts to retrieve them without incident. Whether you believe he should have been indicted or not, that was real, consequential wrongdoing. The point of the “retribution” tour against the likes of Cheney and Romney is to punish them for *right-doing*: They offended populist Republicans not by trying to overthrow the government or absconding with classified information or cheating on their taxes but simply by insisting on holding Trump accountable to the Constitution for his authoritarian lousiness.

They did their civic duty. And now they must pay.

If you’re mortified by Team Biden’s interest in shielding right-doers for fear of how Trump might use the precedent to shield wrongdoers, you’re drawing a moral equivalence that *greatly*benefits the wrongdoers. Or, at the very least, you’re assuming that Americans can no longer differentiate morally between pardoning wrongdoers and right-doers, between clemency for the January 6 rioters and clemency for Liz Cheney, and so you’ve decided that a universal norm of not pardoning political allies is best.

And you know what? It probably is. If this year’s Republican presidential primary and general election results meant anything, it’s that lots of Americans *can’t* differentiate between right and wrong in politics anymore. It’d be a fitting, albeit depressing, benediction at the ongoing funeral of American exceptionalism to watch Liz Cheney not only lose her political career for opposing a coup plot but lose her life savings defending herself against frivolous criminal charges—all while the public shrugs."

Rebuke those spirits and demons they are trying to take you out of here and have you suffering for all eternity..

He hears me and he may never heal me… but my life is not mine to take. Victory is for those who ENDURE! Eternity is much longer than this life and I would rather suffer another 30-40 years than to be in the lake of fire for ETERNITY! 
Jesus’ Grace is sufficient.. his power is made perfect in weakness. When you are at your weakest deepest in your sin and sorrow he is closest to you waiting for you to call on him.

Weeping may endure for a night but Joy comes in the morning. You will survive 100% of your bad days.. don’t let the enemy win. Give it a week… then on the last day of that week give it another week, then on the last day of that week give it another week…and again and again and before you know it you will remember the Joy that the Lord has brought you and the peace. 

Don’t let the enemy win! Pray this prayer in your mind or aloud
 “Lord I come to you with a humble heart, please forgive me for my sins, my works of iniquity, and my transgressions of your law. Please have mercy on me, I am a sinner and I need you almighty Lord, please cover me in the blood of Jesus and set your angels to protect me in this time. Guide my steps Lord, heal my heart father, please renew my mind, restore my joy, grant me wisdom that only you can give and peace beyond understanding Lord. Cleanse me of unclean spirits Lord and make me new, heal my brokenness Lord and make me whole, I lay at your altar all that I have Lord help me fight against the evil one God and give me strength to endure. Rebuke the wicked spirits that torment me Lord and fill me with the Holy Spirit God. I denounce and rebuke the demonic forces in my mind Lord, I belong to you Jesus. In Jesus name I pray I am redeemed by the blood of Jesus, the almighty name of Jesus. Amen”"

Try to do your best in class, and spend a healthy amount of your free time doing something productive. Exactly what that looks like depends on what interests you! If you like music, maybe play an instrument for your school orchestra, march either your school’s marching band, or start a band with some friends. If you play a sport at the high school level, take it seriously, even if you aren’t good enough or are interested in playing at the college level. Are there clubs at your school that interest you? Debate, chess, drama, volunteering, whatever? Can you get involved with a religious congregation if you belong to one?

College applications are basically just showing you’re not a bum. You can show that you’re dedicated and passionate about doing one thing excellently, or that you do a lot of things and get along with a lot of different people and have something to contribute because of it. Barrett is a little more selective than some other public institution, but it’s not Harvard. Follow what interests you and involve yourself in the world.

Whether that is truly altruistic in the sense of, “I must protect this baby,” we will never know, as dog psychology is extremely nuanced as we don’t speak the same language, and this is the only video we have to go on.

All you can do, is seek advice from a behaviourist; I read in another comment that you don’t think this is necessary, however, dogs require lifelong training and and retraining to maintain appropriate behavioural patterns, so this shouldn’t be ruled out, especially at a moment when not just yours but your dogs circumstances have changed (new baby). 

In terms of the behaviour that your dog is showing, you will have to be on the lookout and on guard to protect your baby here. If your dog has the slightest inclination that your baby is theirs as demonstrated by their desire to protect (and yes, this is sweet), your dog may bite someone or accidentally the baby if people get in the middle of them. 
That is the worst case scenario, but a situation that unfortunately does occur and a reason why involving a behaviourist at this stage would be an appropriate response.

Your dog and baby can still have a close bond. There’s no reason that a Chow-Chow by nature is the problem. But you have the power to foster this relationship into the one you want it to be.

Good luck and congratulations on your new addition."

AITA For ditching my friends after they continuously treat me like I don’t belong. 

AITA For ditching my friends after they continuously treat me like I don’t belong. 

I 16F have recently been feeling like I’m unwanted in my own friend group, I have tried my best to ignore the signs that they may not want me there, but now things have crossed the line. 

No matter what I do it is clear that my best is no longer good enough for them, and even when I choose to leave it causes more problems, where now I don’t even know what to do. 

They have turned everything that I have once cared for into a competition, where now I’m slowly losing interest in the things I like. Even the stuff that should’ve been good, I’m now struggling with. They either want to use me for the things I’ve accomplished, or treat me like I’m dumb for focusing on those aspects. For example, I recently got a new job as a line cook and while I barely hang out with them, they tend to ask me, and correct me on that job, wanting not only referrals, but rides. I no longer feel wanted for me, but the new things I have. They make fun of me for my intellect and throw me down in order to bring themselves up in front of others. I’m either too aggressive, or too dumb to understand the fundamental conversations that we normally have. Where my input is no longer accepted. I’m starting to feel alone, because when I’m there I’m not needed, or wanted, but when I leave I’m harassed and not good enough. 

I want to stop being friends with them but I’m worried that expressing how I feel will only cause more problems, could anyone help me out?

**Emberward** - [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2459550/Emberward/) - A tower defense game where the core mechanic is being able to change the flow of the map via tetramino-esque cards. There are multiple characters with their own unique playstyle too.

**Rabbit and Steel** - [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2132850/Rabbit_and_Steel/) - Take the raid/trial mechanics from MMOs and apply it to a screen-filling 2D style replete with similar combat but in a roguelike fashion. The battles are quick and fun and you'll have your rear kicked time and time again while learning the ins and outs of each class/role."

People know Andrew Schulz mainly for his Netflix comedy specials, Flagrant podcast and his appearances on the Joe Rogan Podcast.

Charlemagne isn't known for anything outside of The Breakfast Club.   The Breakfast Club is only known by people as that one radio show that has hip-hop and rap artists on as guests, therefore it belongs to the black community.

Andrew Schulz was on an MTV2 show? The Breakfast Club is in the Radio Hall of Fame?  I don't want to make the assumption you're black, but sorry dude, you're probably in an echo chamber."

*The girls’ luggage.* So, multiple girls own the luggage. The apostrophe is put at the end of the plural noun ending in S.

*The women’s luggage.* So, multiple women own the luggage. This works differently because the plural noun is irregular: it doesn’t end in S. So we form the possessive in the same way as a singular noun, e.g. *the woman’s luggage* (the luggage belongs to only one woman) or *the girl’s luggage* (the luggage belongs to only one girl)."

>The Whispers: The whispers were retconned. They were clearly meant to be associated with the Others, not just random ghosts. MIB’s Powers Post-Jacob: After Jacob’s death, we’re told the Smoke Monster can’t shapeshift anymore—but all his other powers remain? More brain-dead writing, just like Ben’s memory-wiping “healing process.”

They were retconned a little bit. Whether they were to be associated with the others or not, they were always meant to be ghosts as evident from the ""It'll come back around"" line in S1E16. They tend to exist around the temple and the ashes, around Smokey because he's basically a huge super-whisper, and around death.

Jacob was the human conduit for the source. Once Jacob died, the source was cutoff from people. If the MiB is powered by the source, it stands to reason that he is cutoff from people too. In general, the island was ""sick"" during that period and a few things didn't work right. The temple water being another example. Think about the scales in the cliffside cave. MiB took of the white stone and the black one plunked down onto the table.

Memory is in the mind, the source is the source of your consciousness. It stands to reason that the temple waters could erase his memory going back to the gunshot. Theres a theory that the island heals by reversing the damage temporally. So if Ben was fully submerged underwater it's like he was reverting to who he was before the injury. I'll admit this feels like the weakest part of the time travel retcons.

>Kate’s Legal Situation: How did Kate get off scot-free just because her mom didn’t testify? She robbed banks, assaulted federal agents, and committed identity fraud. That doesn’t just go away.

Idk...not a lawyer. Pretty sure that sherif was hired by Mom and now he's gone. He would've been the one following all the things she's done. There was even a point when he was gonna let her live a married life as long as she stayed put...like he was the only one in charge of her shit. Without either of them I can suspend my disbelief I guess.

>Kate as Aaron’s Mom: There’s no way Kate could plausibly pass as Aaron’s mom. Too many people saw her right before she got off the plane. Airport footage would confirm she wasn’t six months pregnant, and the baby was clearly much older than she claimed. Someone would’ve figured out Aaron was Claire’s baby based on the timing. Because she's a felon with a history of blowing things up, after the plane disappeared, there'd likely be a massive investigation into her background to see if she took the plane down.

Yeeeah...I imagine people DID question it. But the truth is also probably more far-fetched. That there were/are other survivors and they are all lying about it. Which one would the public choose to believe?

>The Freighter: Why didn’t Ben blow up the freighter? He clearly didn’t care about innocent lives, and destroying it would’ve eliminated a massive threat.

Ben mostly believed that he WAS doing the good guy. He was not a mass murderer like Widmore (Ben did not order the purge. Widmore did). He thought he had everything under control because he didn't expect Charlie to swim down to the looking glass.

>Luckily the characterization is so good, that the series is still worth a rewatch, however, I've never watched a series where it's so obvious the writers are making shit up as they go along as lost.

I believe they only made it up as they went from season to season. Each season was a thought of ""what is the next thing in the chain of cause and effect and why"". Each season feels like a coherent thought to me (S4 has some iffy things because of the strike though). There's no way the writers were bulshitting all that much past S1. It's not a perfect show, but these writers are GOOD. It's hard to deal with ridiculous network demands for 24 family friendly episodes a year and still tell a coherent story. I think they deserve some credit beyond just ""the characters were good"""

2,2024-12-24,u/Cryoptic-,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1hlgym3/any_tips_to_increase_the_mmr/m3n0r69/,"when theres a discrepancy between rank and mmr, u just need to play enough games for it to even out. ur mmr will eventually catch up.

rule of thumb, mmr and rank ""moves"" at different speeds. say u have a new account, u get placed silver and ur demolishing games. ur mmr speeds and overtakes ur rank. then ur rank has to play catch up, and u eventually get to where ur mmr stops or slows down.

when ur rank is higher than ur mmr, u just need to play games in order for ur mmr to catch up and ""sync"" up.

this seperation of the 2 helps with multiple things, but what i wanna mention here is that it prevents slightshotting. so once u have somewhat ""established"" ur rank / mmr, or the place u should be, then u wont just zip up nor down the ranks with a unlucky or lucky streak. 

to prove the system that ur actually workse or better than ur estimated skill level, u need consistent winrate changes, over time.

and thats essentially ur spot. the game thinks u may belong slightly lower. if u prove to the game u hold ur own in this rank, the mmr comes up to ur rank. if ur mmr is actually right, and u lose a little more, ur rank goes back down to where ur mmr wants to be.

hope that makes sense, but yeah, tldr, play enough games and it will even out."

He was in everything and cameo'd all the time. But by the late 2000s/early 2010s Trump majorly fell off the public radar and in 2015 only ran for president as a joke/publicity stunt. Then he became a pawn/figurehead for the far right and the power hungry, attention starved Trump leaned into it solely to gain power and influence. And in the end he, originally a joke candidate, won not once, but twice, and reshaped the Republican party single-handedly from the party of small government and individual rights to the party of hatred and bigotry. Trump was a lifelong Democrat before 2015, but grifted to the right because quote ""Republicans are much easier to manipulate than Democrats."" Now Trump is arguably one of the most famous and widely hated (and beloved by his rabid cult-like fans) figures in the world and the current age, and will likely go down as one of the most infamous presidents in American history as well as arguably the worst one of all time. He got his wish, he's now exceedingly famous, far more than he was as a TV personality."

**1 Corinthians 11:9** Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.



Again, she was created to help him and he was not created for the purpose of helping her. This is important becausae the modern woman believes that men exist to serve the woman which is absolutely backwards. Because of pride most modern women hate the role that the Most High gave us and they fail to understand that He has an order and protocol for the faamily that is beneficial to everyone.



This is why the law of the Hebrews states that when the Israelites are fighting against a nation that does not inhabit the land of Canaan, they are to kill all of the men but are to take the spoil or booty for themselves and women are included in the category of ‘spoils’:

**Deuteronomy 30:13-14** And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:

**14 But the women**, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, **even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself;** and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God hath given thee.



As you just read in verse 14, the women and the children are both considered spoils or booty because they are considered to be property of the men.

**Again, biblically speaking a woman is the property or possession of her husband:**

**Ecclesiasticus 36:24** He that getteth a wife beginneth a possession, a help like unto himself, and a pillar of rest.

As you just read above, a man that has a wife has a possession, help, and pillar of rest. She is a possession because she belongs to him. She’s supposed to be his helper and comforter."

Znaci trebalo bi ovo cak i ozakoniti. Kada dodje do ubistva, sve sto se smije reci jeste npr: zenska osoba ubijena u mostaru, dalje u objavi vrijeme kada je pocinjeno, dal se traga za ubicom ili ne, i to je to. 

A ne NOVI FEMICID POCINJEN NAD MAJKOM TROJE DJECE, UBICA GLEDAO PORNJICE PRIJE UBIJANJA. 

Sve je za javnost suvisno. Ostalo je izmedju advokata, sudija, i porodica zrtve i pocinitelja. 

Naveo sam da se i slucaj suicida ne objavljuje u vijestima da to ne bi ohrabrilo druge. I da je to psiholoski dokazano. Kada se marylin monroe ubila, to su bile vijesti po citavom svijetu i da se stopa suicida u Los Angelesu udvostrucila u narednih mjesec dana. To pise na wikipediji. 

Dal mi to isto radimo curama i zenama?"

1. PCP is designed as a way to buy your car later, so you have marginally smaller payments than HP but a balloon payment or a refinance window at the end term. If you have no interest in owning your car, pcp is actually a terrible idea. You’ll be paying more than the depreciation of the car because the intention is for you to buy it afterwards (see point 3).

2. HP - the car is really yours from the minute you make your first finance payment. It doesn’t matter if you’ve put 80k miles on the car in 3 years. You own it at the end, and you can decide to keep it a little longer or trade it in… this is the most flexible, and financially the steadiest… yes you may pay £150 a month more than pcp but you don’t have to worry about that explosion at the end… 

3. PCH - this is a much more American model but is gaining traction in the UK. There’s some big companies out there. You lease the car at a reasonable rate, and hand it back at the end. No option to purchase. You are a registered keeper, not owner. This allows you to drive brand new cars at a reasonable cost… the finance company leasing the car is obviously making some money off you and they’ll sell the car on after you’ve handed it back. I’ll break down the cost below. 

Tesla M3 @ 15k annual miles and 3 years with 2.5k down payment
PCH: 434
PCP: 637 and 16.7k final payment
HP: 1089

No one is is better than the other. If you do lower milage, HP over 5-7 years is probably better as the car will have some good value at the end of it. However if you are doing around 15-20k a year, the car is not going to be sought after and will have lost a lot of money. 

If you do average miles and not sure if you will keep the car, pcp might work. 

Statistically, something like only 5% of PCP vehicles are bought, which makes that model of buying ludicrous. You are essentially leasing the car at an inflated price. 

P.S I do similar mileage to you. I went electric on PCH… I get to drive a brand new car for the same price as pcping something like a 2-3 year old puma/focus. 

Also, 500 miles costs about a tenner in an EV."

I too come from Native American ancestry and not just 1-5%. I have ZERO East Asian markers.

Malta boy's research has blown that theory out of the water of significant East Asian DNA and this makes sense to me. It is why they are saying East Asians came from a more recent period of time and settled primarily in higher proportions in Alaska, Oregon and even parts of California. It is there throughout the Americas but at much lower levels therefore it is not as widely spread as previously thought.

We know this is recent because throughout the rest of the United States and the Americas this marker is not found in many populations outside of the above of any significance while it can be throughout the Americas. It is part of the story of Native Americans but it is not there in the proportions of the theory of an East Asian branch being the ancestors of modern Native Americans nor is it a major part of the story of Native Americans.

Haplogroups A B C D are all considered NA DNA but you have to realize these letters are rather all arbitrary as the DNA family system is really new and has only been around for a short period of time for the sciences to figure out migration patterns. A2 for example is just a subclad of A a development over time. A is found in Siberia and among Uralic **(Modern day Finland Estonia, Hungary, Scandinavia to western Siberia, comprising the Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic groups.** ) Turkic would include regions of Turkey/Greece. Overall DNA migration patterns of peoples  themselves are theoretical. Everything is on the table in other words. Everything can be changed when we find our findings like Malta boy.

The old Eugenic theory of some large early branch from East Asian expansion into the Americas was disproved with Malta boy's DNA. Native Americans do NOT match current modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean populations this is how they knew something was wrong with their original theory.  Otherwise scientists would see and you would see depending on your inheritance for example would see 35% Asian as your population group. Native Americans are a distinct population group that is ancient and whose DNA did not fit the DNA profiles it was given so assumptions were made.

This is why scientists know Native American are a distinct population group that did not come from the old original erroneous theory based on facial Phenotype of a large East Asian expansion into the United States hence Native Americans are just an Asian branch.

That was indeed the whole point to Malta Boy, which I think is fascinating. For the first time we had the ancestry of Native Americans found IN Malta Boy's DNA. They had to test and retest in fact to make sure there was no contamination with multiple labs because of this European result. They did not expect this outcome that when tested against ALL population groups, the population group that matched him the most were Native Americans and Europeans from every region of the Americas he match Native Americans. Here is part of the findings.

***""Conspicuously absent from the child’s DNA, however, was any connection to modern East Asians, a genetic relationship present in the genomes of virtually all Native Americans. This means that the population from which the boy came must have included ancestors of modern Native Americans, upsetting the popular belief that the original inhabitants of North, Central, and South America descended directly from East Asians.*** 

***The Mal’ta boy belonged to a population that migrated to Siberia from Eurasia and mixed with the second before the newly formed population moved into the New World, eventually populating the Americas.***

***Previously, the presence of European DNA in the modern Native American genome was attributed to interbreeding after Europeans made contact. This new finding may turn that supposition on its head. “The west Eurasian \[genetic\] signatures that we very often find in today's Native Americans don't all come from postcolonial admixture,” Willerslev said during his presentation. “Some of them are ancient.***

***Though reconstructing humanity’s westward expansion into the New World involves some speculation, recovering the intact DNA of the Mal’ta boy represents a technological feat: his is oldest complete genome of a modern human sequenced to date."" \~***Willerslev and Graf Texas A&M University

Texas A &M are the main group studying Malta boy along with other European researchers. The DNA is clear Native Americans come from Europeans etc. that mixed with Siberians before arriving in the New world to create what we know now as Native Americans. It is why European DNA in Native Americans was dismissed as modern post European contact. Native Americans always knew this however, Native Americans are related to those people in Scandinavia and even in Eastern Europe etc. before mixing with Siberians going across the land bridge they share origin stories, language usage, art, etc. now DNA.  

It also proves Native Americans have been here in the Americas longer than previously thought. In doing this it disproves the theory based on fallible Eugenic facial phenotype theory that Native Americans are just a branch of East Asians because they ""look like them"". This should be celebrated that we are finally understanding the truth to our origins as a people. The truth should never be hidden because it disrupts current thought of what we are comfortable with. :D"

I want to see Izuku fully embrace being a hero again, and not treat his lifelong dream like a hobby he can do on the weekends.

I want all of the characters to prove there is still a place for heroes in the world, and not have to worry about possible unemployment.

I theorised that 431 would lead to a full-on sequel series, and while I seriously doubt that will happen after this letter dropped, a series of short manga would be the next best thing.

That's rough, buddy

>That's just the way the school calendar works, right? Seems like it'd break immersion to not bring up exams in the Christmas arc. It got the study group together the other day.


You'd be surprised, a lot of animes skimp out on specific details. 

>Taken individually, I disagree. Taiga/Ryuji isn't as co-dependent as it looks from the outside. They have a lovely found-family and trust each other deeply. Ryuji/Minori have a deep admiration for each other and the way they affect others. There've been hints at other facets to both of them, but it's not unhealthy for both of them to work with what they've been given. Ami is only right when you look at the whole, and the ever evolving Taiga x Ryuji relationship. I don't like the comparison to mommy-daddy-baby. It makes it sound like meeting someone thru a mutual friend is something dirty. It's not their fault Taiga also wanted a sense of belonging. Ami does get at the crux though: Ryuji and Taiga's bond is so deep that it's hard to separate from romantic feelings. No one is ever going to care for Taiga as deeply as Ryuji has this past semester, and it's not fair to have Minori compete with that.

Unfortunately, Minori agrees which is why she's doing what she's doing. 

>I for one am shocked that her snide comments have not won him over yet. /s Kitamura was right. Unless she pulls off the mask, she's not going to find any real (boy)friends. The scene in the storage room starts with Ryuji snapping at her. I think she realizes that if she can't put her defenses down and summon a little authenticity then she'll never have a chance.

It's becoming more ans more apparent that Ami really screwed herself with the fake personality bullcrap.

>It's more than they deserve. I hope Santa is taking notes. Sending them in the post is an even stronger endorsement of her character imo. She's not around to reap any benefit. It's just good will.

Taiga has a better relationship with her parents than my mom has with hers.

>Sweet. Also funny that she didn't want Ryuji to know. It'd ruin her street cred?

Can't be looked at as too much of a softie. 

>She better. And Inko.


Inko gets extra bird food. Like extra extra.

>These 2 combined are pretty saccharine, but I think it's the most compelling reason to have her love Christmas the way she does. Notice that no one around her does, and I'm hard pressed to name another anime character that comes close. ""The giving spirit"" is a little vague and out of character. But nostalgic for Santa to the point of sending presents to orphans? That's character motivation.

And she makes me motivated, as I assume others as well. 

>I think your question needs the rest of the dialogue to track. Taiga was obviously rich. Not getting gifts was not the reason she lacked happiness growing up. But having that sense that someone is watching over you could've done it. That's why she sends them from Santa.

That's a very good point 

>The party before the storm. It's a great psych out. Surely Kitamura's rein will be a prosperous one.


He's off to a good start 

>Be careful, guys don't like women that are too independent. It makes them feel like there's no space for them in your life. 


That's when cats get involved [](#azusalaugh)

>It says a lot about how much she loves Christmas and how little she holds dear that the star is her most prized possession. It's very pretty, yes. But she hasn't found a keepsake to supplant it? What about that crepe wrapper from the culture festival?

Taiga seems to have all the faith in the world that things will work out. Heart on her sleeve, and her hope on her chest.

>She's probably lying. But I'm impressed that they managed to get it so far together after that. And it probably does sparkle more with all those new facets. But it's gotta be looking rough. 

I actually think Taiga is being genuine. Much like Kitamura with the egg, it is more of what it symbolizes.

>In the metaphorical world, I guess this is Taiga saying she's stronger after the hard times? She's the star that Ryuji and Minori helped put back together, cuter than before. That feels good for this line, but I had a different answer for Minori's earlier dialogue. Did it switch, or was I wrong, or is it both? Teacher! I need more paper!


I see the scene as like a companion piece to the race aftermath in episode 13 when Taiga said she'd be fine on her own.

>Miss Yuri before the OP: ""it's only right if everyone comes since you're working so hard on it."" Minori right before the ED: ""It wouldn't be right for me to come since I ruined everything.""

2,2024-12-17,u/gkmnky,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1hgcput/red_pocket_question/m2jobmh/,"Red envelopes are one thing, engagement another - both depend on where your girlfriend comes from and how traditional her family is. 

For example in north east China it’s totally normal that the potential husband pays money for the girls family … normal families somehow will expect several thousand dollars. If the family is more wealth $10.000 and even $100.000 or more is somehow normal and expected. Also girls family will expect that the husband or his family will buy a house … for Chinese people normally the daughter will leave the family and will now belong to husbands family … 

There are so many strange things going on with engagement … I totally lost track. Some of my family and friends they sends lots of cash up to 500k some send meat, some send jewelry, some send pure gold … I guess every area has their own traditions. 

Good for you, you are a foreigner so her mom will not really expect you will know 😅 also in favor for you, her mom is already divorced, so no super traditional family. 

Maybe your girlfriend just want to give her mom as much as possible as she think maybe your family not safe up enough … but she is to shy to mention to you … 

To be honest it’s a struggle for every Chinese girl and also Chinese boy … 

Just advice, never hold on for the cash, just let it go … 😂

And not be surprised your wife will get a bigger amount from her mom after marriage, it’s just for her to keep in the bank, just for emergency if you not take care of her - not even count this money into anything - it’s just there. And it’s hers … 

Also better get used to it. Your money is hers, her money is hers … you will technically have no money 😂😂"

Yes, you can run a Tesla Powerwall without solar panels. In this setup, the Powerwall functions as a battery backup system, storing energy from the grid and supplying power to your home during outages or peak hours.

Key Uses:

1. Backup Power: Provides electricity during blackouts.


2. Time-Based Control: Charge the Powerwall during off-peak hours (when electricity is cheaper) and discharge it during peak hours to reduce energy costs.


3. Load Shifting: Helps manage energy usage by drawing power from the Powerwall when rates are high.



However, without solar, you won't be generating your own electricity, so you'll rely entirely on grid power for charging. This means you won't benefit from energy independence or renewable energy savings, but you can still enjoy the advantages of reliable backup power and potentially lower electricity costs."

Pack the middle with defenders is not talking about Midfield as is relevant to this context because Akenji, Gundo, Kova, Rico, Silva, Foden midfield is simply not it.

Their wing play when (Doku & Savinho play) is okay, so is the CF. So are the CBs. 

Even this Walker-washed nonsense is a cascade effect of the midfield collapse. Barca had this issue for 5 seasons straight post Alves leaving, i.e. the midfield becomes too stretched (in absence of quality individuals) and that ultimately spills over to 1 of the flanks.

City inside channels/half-spaces are dead with Foden playing so bad that the No 1 primary critique vector against Pep should be the number of minutes given to Foden. He simply Does Not belong in 1st division football right now. He is not bad, he is beyond absurdly horrible, words simply can not describe how horrendous Foden has been and WHAT that does to the City structure, i.e. a direct function of TEMPO, i.e. that ""passing around"" thing you mentioned. KDB & Foden are the players in the center (outside of Rodri or outright wingers) who generate the timing of the Tempo.

You can not pass around at High Tempo (like City do 90%+ of the time) because your midfield is too slow (Gundo can barely run to recover transition shape, how the heck does one expect him to cover for other Midfielders, so much so Pep is basically playing him higher up to not even bother him being near CBs) & the 1 person that allows to shift that tempo (Foden) can't even trap a ball being passed by defensive Midfielders or CB right now. 

There is no ""Secret"" to beat City. City beat everyone consistent enough for past 8 seasons. A Secret is by definition, something very few know/use. 

Football doesn't work like that. There is ""Secret"" in football at this level. You have a strategy that is high odds potential and that is it. And there is nothing of the sort for City, because when City are  on a roll (which is basically every season) there is barely nothing that can stop them from winning League Titles.

Liverpool won the title NOT because they exploited some ""Secret"" against City, they were simply All-Time Historic levels of elite good. That is not a secret that is simply an outlier freakish run. That is not a strategy (which is prerequisite for execution of this ""Secret"").

Hence your comment was hashed up generic tropes that exist on twitter (& on reddit & even in lame media punditry) about how there is this ""Secret XYZ strat"" that one just needs to do to get points vs City/Pep. So easy.

The mere narrative is beyond silly."

He only *needs* that defense because he insists on acting the fool. That's the part that shows him with the emotional maturity of a 14yo.

In a sea of darkness, there stood a shred of light alone and looking far too out of place. Momentarily unmoving even as the arena echoed with the roars of monsters Damian has only seen in books and paintings, of monsters he’s only heard from stories of his father and teachers.

                There was one painting he distinctly remembered, one so tall and wide it reached almost half of the entire gallery. It was one of those historical ones detailing the King of Hell’s might during the “olden days”, in which a small and lone figure of Lucifer Morningstar—in all his shining and fiery glory—standing amidst a torrent of crimson and darkness, right beneath a depiction of Heaven in the form of ominous white spears pointing down below.

                The painting had belonged to a noble he and his father once visited during a function. Everyone there talked about it all day and night—or at least, it felt like it was—and while Damian usually loved stories about the Seven Rings, how they came to be, the wars they fought, and the enemies they vanquished throughout the eons, he could rarely ever find it in himself to be interested in learning about *the* King.

                And sure, every child of hell has heard stories of Lucifer Morningstar—poems, nursery rhymes, songs, there was at least one or a hundred all about him. But to Damian, they had only been that: just stories, poems, and songs. Another figure of myth that wasn’t all that different from all the other fairy tales he’s heard. Except the myth was actually alive—or so they say despite no one having seen him outside of his own Ring for several years… until now.

                Damian watched that living myth swing his sword not unlike one would in a dance, an inferno of golden and white flames followed his arm, cascading onto a swarm of undead abominations—only for another horde to surge forward. The King remained undeterred, and in that moment, Damian remembered the painting.

                Another swing, another dozen felled. Another strike, another deluge of horrors disintegrated like flecks of golden dust. Numbly, his mind pulsed with another revelation.

                Lucifer Morningstar did not fight like a Wrathian warrior. He did not fight like any warrior at all.

                He fought like a *spirit*."

The other one was when SpaceX was having success he was always at the press conferences to brag. Then they had an ISS resupply mission that failed. He was nowhere to be found.

I am a teacher at MPS, attended one of the other districts in the area as a K-12 student and have taught in multiple cities across the US before returning the MI two years ago to work at MPS. 

Our students, staff, administrators and educating adults care so much about school success. Coming from working in other districts, I have been extremely impressed with MPS curriculum, staff support, ongoing staff professional development and the most supportive work environment I have worked in. I agree with the comment regarding parent support changing between districts around the area, and certainly more opportunities are created and supported with parent support. 

Mona shores has a fantastic football program, AP class offerings, performing arts programs and art programs. 

Muskegon offers much the same with programs with as Poppen program which supports studying arts within the Muskegon Community. In addition they are working to open “FORD NGL” programming within the next two years which will allow all high school students to leave with an internship, associates degree, on job training or technical training in careers that they have chosen. Muskegon is one of 2 schools in the state working on this educational initiative. 

If you have a student in special education I would offer that I believe other districts may have more established and effective special education programs"

Hasta que conoció al chico que sería su esposo. La química fue inmediata. Se casó a los 45 y es feliz.

Por otra parte puede que seas una persona asexual (Personas que no experimentan atracción física y/o sexual hacia otras personas, y de hacerlo es con muy poca frecuencia) Esta es una condición no tan común, pero que existe. Las personas con este tipo de cualidad tienden a tener un interés más innato hacia lo intelectual, el arte o la filosofía. Y debido a su condición pueden enfocarse en ello sin nada que los distraiga, por lo que usualmente pueden hacer grandes contribuciones a la sociedad.

Una persona asexual que seguro conoces es el apóstol Pablo de las sagradas Escrituras, debido a la misión que Dios le encomendó. También se ha planteado la posibilidad de que figuras históricas como Nikola Tesla, Isaac Newton y Franz Kafka hayan sido asexuales.

THAT is what you are teaching them. 

Your kids know. They see and hear things you wouldn't even think they do. And they are learning every second. They're going to model their behavior after what they see.

\- got kicked out as CEO of XBank and Paypal

\- ""founded"" Tesla by investing, then kicking out the actual Founders (later having a large settlement to make sure he can call himself the Founder)

\- In 2011 he said we will be on Mars in 10 years, in 2017 he said we will be there in 5 years

\- He claims basically every other day that fully 100% safe self-driving cars are just a few months away

\- said that if you buy a Tesla, that by 2020 it can basically work for you as a self-driving Cab, even going as far as showing a completely fake app for it

\- in 2014 he claimed that Tesla batteries could be swapped within minutes (to get a bunch of government subsidies)

\- Constantly has the most fucking stupid ideas to ""improve"" public transit (which means sabotaging it at any point to sell more Cars) like the ""Tunnels"" he made promises about to on many occasions, then leaving all the Cities he promised to work with in the Dust, except Vegas, and that ""Tunnel"" is basically 1 Guy driving you slowly in traffic instead of the fully autonomous underground Cab (also all the promises about HyperLoop were lies to stop California working on High Speed Rail)

\- said Covid would be over by April 2020

\- said Twitter will have a billion monthly users by 2023

\- Starlink speeds would double by 2021

\- Solar Tiles (never happened)

\- promised to fix the Flint Water Crisis (never did)

\- called the guy saving the Thailand cave kids a pedo

\- forced Twitter employees to rewrite the Algorithm to boost his own tweets after Bidens super bowl tweet got more likes than his (left the party early to do that)

And thats just the bullshit he was up to before the whole shitshow with Twitter began and he slowly sunk into the depths of alt-right chud circles, spreading misinformation, targeting minorities, and much much more.

You can interpret all this from many angles, but when you break it down, you have the picture of a deeply insecure, probably stupid man craving for attention and respect, which he now finds wholesale in right wing circles, where nothing you do will be questioned as long as you stay in Line."

Creo que nunca había comprado tanta fruta en mi vida, pero las comimos en el apartamento y el weon estaba más feliz que la chucha, decía que en Japón solo se conseguía plátanos, frutillas, mandarinas y pedazos de sandía de forma accesible.

He can absolutely run again. Nothing says a person can't *run* for President.

>US presidents are limited to 2 terms

>Unless the constitution is amended there will be no and somehow he returned.

No. The text of the 22nd Amendment reads as it reads, but it's never actually been tested in court. And there are centuries of precedents and judgements the Supreme Court can pick and choose from to nullify it if they don't want to limit Trump...just as they did with the 14th Amendment.

The section 3 of the 14th Amendment says people who took an oath and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the US cannot hold office again unless Congress removes the disqualification by a two thirds vote. Yet even though a trial court found that Trump did engage in insurrection, the US Supreme Court decided that section 3 doesn't count because there isn't a law passed by Congress that says so, because they decided that that is necessary for that particular section (but apparently not for the other sections, which have been used directly from the Constitution many times), because they didn't want it to impact Trump in that election.

So all the US Supreme Court would need to do to nullify the 22nd Amendment would be to delay taking any case to remove Trump from the ballot until close to the election (during which time Trump highlights whatever poll numbers make him look good, real or not, and assures his voters that his lawyers have ""the best arguments"" that will stop the radical left Marxist Democrats from taking away peoples' right to vote), then issue a specific case ruling to allow the election to continue because they don't want to overrule the voters who might conceivably choose to elect Trump. Or say that, because of some cherry picked combination of rulings, the 22nd Amendment has never actually been enforceable because it doesn't have a federal law clarifying it (they could then render any attempt to pass such a law as unconstitutional by ruling that it specifically targets Trump).

We literally watched them do it with the 14th Amendment. It has happened.

If Trump decides he wants a third term, we should expect him to try. And we should *not* expect any help from the court. And if we want to prevent that, we should take steps to deal with him well before the next election (ie wear him down to the point he can't or won't continue, remove him from office before then and convict him and imprison him for his many crimes, weaken his power by disgracing him in the eyes of his followers and undermining his authority within the Republican Party, and so on).

We should not be counting on the law to protect us. Because remember that, regardless of everything else, Trump is going to be President, and the Supreme Court already ruled that Presidents are immune to any law that would restrict their use of their power (including talking to members of the executive branch and asking them to commit federal felonies, which was the specific subject of the case that resulted in this ruling)."

1. A 10-year relationship deserves basic respect and honesty. The fact that she's actively planning to hide this affair (yes, emotional affairs ARE affairs!) shows she's putting her own comfort above his right to make informed decisions about his future.




2. Bipolar disorder may explain past behavior but it does NOT excuse a calculated year-long deception involving secret codes, hidden messages, and lying to someone's face. That's not mania, that's manipulation.




The ""tell her first or I will"" approach is absolutely the fairest way. It:


* Gives her a chance to do the right thing
* Puts the responsibility back on her where it belongs  
* Shows more consideration for everyone involved than she's shown anyone




And honestly? If the holidays are awkward because you exposed a serial cheater, that's on HER, not you. Your conscience will be clean.

You opened by saying it wasn't that useful, but this is just exactly what the guy you responded to said "

>Rolling a dice takes more time than actual tracking bullets

Time, sure, but sometimes the issue isn't time. It's logistics and management. Combat can take time anyway—adding another roll is fine as long as it contributes to the experience. Tracking ticks, etc., doesn't take time, but it doesn't add suspense either; it's basically Accounting 101.

>You can also to further simplify this, just do this after combat where you used ammunition. This makes the simplest tracking

Again, this one is simple at the cost of suspense. If OP's goal is the risk of running out of ammo mid-combat, then this is as useless as just not tracking ammo at all.

This next part is subjective, but I think rolling for ammo *is* exciting (especially if you did it at the end of your turn instead of the start; or at the start, but it indicated that you were on your last shot and you can either shoot it or save it for a more opportune time, etc.). That adds suspense and complications to the game, which is fun. OP's 2nd method would feel frustrating, though.

The Gamma World method isn't a bad idea, depending on the feel you're going for. It does feel a little more musketeer-y than sci-fi, though.

I like the crit idea; same with the recovery idea."

I wouldn't have called it romantic, but it's not far off it! 


It's a feeling of warmth, affection, belonging. I can definitely feel the personality of a house. I want to move into an old house of good character some day. I used to think everything had feelings when I was a child. I couldn't throw anything away for fear of hurting it ha, even a scrap of paper. 


I love this thread, your OP and responses are fascinating you have a wonderful mind :) it's a shame you're feeling so isolated over something so completely harmless. "

Somehow Elon Musk has escaped prosecution.  A federal judge even ruled, ""OK he lied since the stock price rose"".  In China, they often execute devious CEO's.  Thomas Jefferson supported the excesses of the French Revolution, saying it is good to periodically roll out the guillotines."
